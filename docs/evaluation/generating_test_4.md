Must assess: retail structure (developed vs kirana shops in India), infrastructure (logistics costs in China 16% GDP), local preferences (delivery services in crowded Asian cities). Design whole-channel view coordinating global supply chain với local delivery.

**(6) Promotion** (Ch.14, 15, 19): **IMC critical** - integrate traditional/digital. Decisions: (1) message - standardize core theme or fully adapt?, (2) media - availability varies (China's Great Firewall), (3) regulations differ, (4) language/cultural sensitivity. Often: global brand identity với local execution.

**Interrelationships:**
- Entry mode constrains control over mix elements
- Product decisions affect pricing (costs) và distribution (channel requirements)
- Local infrastructure affects both distribution AND pricing (logistics costs)
- Cultural factors affect ALL elements
- Resource availability influences depth of commitment
- Competitive landscape affects positioning across mix

**Systematic process:** Environment analysis → Entry mode → Product adaptation → Channel design → Pricing → Promotion - tất cả must align với overall strategy và local realities. Cannot make decisions in isolation.

**Vị trí:** Tích hợp Ch.9 (product development), Ch.10 (pricing), Ch.12 (channels), Ch.14-15 (promotion), Ch.19 (global decisions, trang 567-592)
