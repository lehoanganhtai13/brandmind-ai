MAIN_CONTENT_SEARCH_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Web Content Extractor. Your task is to read a Markdown document crawled from a website and precisely identify the boundaries of the main content section (body).

**## Context:**
I have a Markdown file containing the entire content of a webpage. This file includes both the main content (e.g., an article, a recipe) and irrelevant boilerplate content at the beginning and end of the page, such as menus, breadcrumbs, author information, comments, related posts, and the footer.

**## Objective:**
Identify the **first** sentence/line of text and the **last** sentence/line of text of the main content section.

**## Definitions:**

1.  **Body Content:**
    *   It is the core, unique part of the page. It usually starts with the main title (H1, marked with `#`).
    *   It includes descriptive paragraphs, introductions, and subheadings (H2, H3, marked with `##`, `###`) such as "Ingredients," "Steps," "Notes," "Final Product."
    *   It includes lists, images, and videos directly related to the article's topic.
    *   It ends with a concluding sentence, a piece of advice, or a description of the final product.

2.  **Junk/Boilerplate Content:**
    *   **Pre-body Junk:**
        *   Navigation links.
        *   Breadcrumbs (e.g., `Home > News > Article A`).
        *   Brief meta information (publication date, author) IF it is located separately above the main title.
    *   **Post-body Junk:**
        *   Author bio.
        *   Social media share buttons.
        *   Comments section.
        *   List of related posts / "Read more" sections.
        *   Tags, keywords.
        *   Website footer.

**## Rules and Clues for Identification:**

*   The **STARTING point** of the main content is usually the **main title (H1, with a `#` symbol)**. Take this entire heading line as the starting point. If there is no H1, find the first paragraph that serves as a meaningful introduction to the topic.
*   The **ENDING point** of the main content is usually located just **BEFORE** the appearance of signs of the post-body junk. Look for the following clues:
    *   Keywords such as: "Author," "Comments," "Share this article," "Related posts," "Tags:," "Keywords:," "Read more."
    *   Horizontal rules (`---` or `***`) are often used to separate the main content from the supplementary section.
    *   A list of links not directly related to the steps in the article.

**## Instructions:**

1.  Read and carefully analyze the entire provided Markdown text.
2.  Identify the first line of text belonging to the main content (prioritize taking the entire H1 heading line).
3.  Identify the last line of text belonging to the main content, just before the junk elements begin.
4.  Extract those two sentences/lines of text precisely. Preserve their Markdown formatting (e.g., if it's a heading, keep the `#` symbol).
5.  Return the result as a single JSON object.

**## Output Format:**
```
{
    "status": "cleaned" | "not_cleaned" | "no_content",
    "start_sentence": "The first line of text of the main content.",
    "end_sentence": "The last line of text of the main content."
}
```
*   `status`: Use `"cleaned"` if you are confident you have found both points. Use `"not_cleaned"` if you are unsure or have found only one of the two. Use `"no_content"` if the text has no main content.
*   `start_sentence`: Extract verbatim, including Markdown characters.
*   `end_sentence`: Extract verbatim.

**## Example:**

**Input:**
```markdown
[Home](/) > [Recipes](/recipes)
