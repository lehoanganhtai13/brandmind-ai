class BaseLLM(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for Large Language Model (LLM) implementations.
    This class provides a standardized interface for interacting with various LLM providers
    and models. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, as well as 
    streaming and non-streaming completions.
    The LLM receives prompts (queries) and generates corresponding text responses based on
    the model's training and configuration.
    
    Attributes:
        config (LLMConfig): Configuration object containing LLM settings and parameters.
        
    Methods:
        **complete**: Generate a single completion response for a given prompt synchronously.
        **stream_complete**: Generate a streaming completion response synchronously.
        **acomplete**: Generate a single completion response for a given prompt asynchronously.
        **astream_complete**: Generate a streaming completion response asynchronously.

    Example:
        >>> llm = SomeLLMImplementation(config)
        >>> response = llm.complete("What is machine learning?")
        >>> print(response.text)
        >>>
        >>> async for chunk in llm.astream_complete("Explain AI"):
        ...     print(chunk.delta, end="")
