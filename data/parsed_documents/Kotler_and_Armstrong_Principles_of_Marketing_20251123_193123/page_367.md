# Multichannel Distribution System

This table illustrates a producer's distribution channels and customer segmentation. The producer, exemplified by John Deere, utilizes multiple channels to reach its customers. Direct sales can occur through catalogs, online platforms, and mobile interfaces. Additionally, the producer employs intermediaries such as retailers and specialized dealers. These dealers can be further categorized into premium full-service dealers, catering to large farm or forestry businesses, and neighborhood dealers, serving individual consumers. The sales force plays a crucial role across these channels, interacting with both consumer segments and business segments, which are themselves divided into distinct categories. This structure highlights a multi-channel strategy designed to serve a diverse customer base, ranging from individual consumers to large commercial enterprises.

When John Deere first began selling selected consumer products through Lowe’s home improvement stores, many of its independent dealers complained loudly. To avoid such conflicts in its online marketing channels, the company routes all of its online sales to John Deere dealers.

## Changing Channel Organization

Changes in technology and the explosive growth of direct and online marketing are having a profound impact on the nature and design of marketing channels. One major trend is toward **disintermediation**—a big term with a clear message and important consequences. Disintermediation occurs when product or service producers cut out intermediaries and go directly to final buyers or when radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional ones.

Thus, in many industries, traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside, as is the case with online marketers taking business from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. For example, online music download services such as iTunes and Amazon MP3 have pretty much put traditional music-store retailers out of business, with physical CDs sinking fast and now capturing less than a third of the music market. In turn, however, streaming music services such as Spotify, Rhapsody, and Apple Music are now disintermediating digital download services—digital downloads peaked last year while music streaming increased 29 percent.

Disintermediation presents both opportunities and problems for producers and resellers. Channel innovators who find new ways to add value in the channel can displace traditional resellers and reap the rewards. In turn, traditional intermediaries must continue to innovate to avoid being swept aside. For example, when Netflix pioneered online DVD-by-mail video rentals, it sent traditional brick-and-mortar video stores such as Blockbuster into ruin. Then Netflix itself faced disintermediation threats from an even hotter channel—video streaming. But instead of simply watching developments, Netflix has led them profitably.

Similarly, superstore booksellers Barnes & Noble and Borders pioneered huge book selections and low prices, shutting down most small independent bookstores. Then along came Amazon.com, which threatened even the largest brick-and-mortar bookstores.
