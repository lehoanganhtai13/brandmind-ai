## Critical Thinking Exercises

**5-6** Researchers study the role of personality on consumer purchase behavior. One research project—Beyond the Purchase—offers a range of surveys consumers can take to learn more about their own personality in general and their consumer personality in particular. Register at http://www.beyondthepurchase.org/ and take the “Spending Habits” surveys along with any of the other surveys that interest you. What do these surveys tell you about your general and consumer personality? Do you agree with the findings? Why or why not? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Diversity; Reflective Thinking)

**5-7** Late adopters are those that tend to be suspicious of new technology and new products. Generally, they fail to see the value of the new capabilities or they don’t feel they can engage with it. These are not necessarily all older consumers. How would you target them? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

**5-8** The characteristics of a new product affect its rate of adoption. Identify the five characteristics that influence the rate of adoption and describe how each factor will influence the rate of adoption of the Apple Watch. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### Blogvertorials

Bloggers can be highly influential. On the one hand, we read their pieces because we value their opinions and ideas, but on the other, do we really know their motivations? There is a growing trend for social media and public relations agencies to approach bloggers to get them to “blogvertize” on their behalf. The agencies also insist that such bloggers make no mention of the fact that they are being paid to make positive statements about certain products and services. In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) state that it is acceptable for a blogger to receive payment for a positive review, but the blogger has to be clear that they are advertising. The ASA suggests signposting paid for posts. The ASA argues that just like any other media, consumers need to be able to judge whether or not they are seeing an advertisement. The clear rules are that advertisements must be obviously identifiable as such and not likely to mislead.

**5-9** Have you encountered this type of blog posting before? Was it clear that the post was an advertisement? How might the fact that the blogger is being paid for an opinion change your view? Write a brief report of your observations. (AACSB: Use of IT; Communication; Reflective Thinking) Are there clear rules in your country concerning blogvertorials, such as the U.S.
