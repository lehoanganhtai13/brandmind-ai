Consumer products carrying the Kodak name are no longer made by Eastman Kodak, which now focuses exclusively on printing-related commercial equipment and technology following its bankruptcy a few years ago. But the Kodak brand name and associated “Kodak moments” still resonate powerfully with consumers. So even though Eastman Kodak has dropped its consumer lines, we’ll still be seeing a lot of Kodak-branded consumer products made by other companies under licensing agreements with Eastman Kodak. For example, Sakar International now makes Kodak cameras and accessories, and the Bullitt Group will soon launch a variety of Kodak electronics, including an Android smartphone and a tablet computer. Video monitoring company Seedonk makes and sells a Kodak Baby Monitoring System.

Thus, the venerable old Kodak name still has value to both Eastman Kodak and the licensees who put it on their products. For Kodak, brand licensing agreements earn the company upward of $200 million a year. In turn, licensees get a name that’s immediately familiar and trusted—it will be a lot easier to market a Kodak phone than a Bullitt phone or a Kodak baby monitoring system than a Seedonk one. “It was difficult to find a brand that resonated—family values, taking care of loved ones,” says a Seedonk executive. “Then the Kodak opportunity came up. Kodak Moments, these are things that are important to our customers.”

Apparel and accessories sellers pay large royalties to adorn their products—from blouses to ties and linens to luggage—with the names or initials of well-known fashion innovators such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Gucci, or Armani. Sellers of children’s products attach an almost endless list of character names to clothing, toys, school supplies, linens, dolls, lunch boxes, cereals, and other items. Licensed character names range from classics such as Sesame Street, Disney, Star Wars, Scooby Doo, Hello Kitty, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Dr. Seuss characters to the more recent Doc McStuffins, Monster High, Frozen, and Minions. And currently, numerous top-selling retail toys are products based on television shows and movies.

Name and character licensing has grown rapidly in recent years. Annual retail sales of licensed products worldwide have grown from only $4 billion in 1977 to $55 billion in 1987 and more than $259 billion today. Licensing can be a highly profitable business for many companies.  
The Smurfs is a Belgian TV brand about the lives of small, blue creatures that live in mushrooms. Created in 1958 as a series of comic characters, the Smurfs today are a multi-million-dollar licensing company that sells products under the Smurfs brand name including video games, toys, magazines, and school items. In 2011, a Smurfs-based movie came out, which gave a boost to the brand’s popularity and the sales of its licensed products.

### Co-branding

> The practice of using the established brand names of two different companies on the same product.

**Co-branding.** Co-branding occurs when two established brand names of different companies are used on the same product. Co-branding offers many advantages. Because each brand operates in a different category, the combined brands create broader consumer appeal and greater brand equity. For example, Benjamin Moore and Pottery Barn joined forces to create a special collection of Benjamin Moore paint colors designed to perfectly coordinate with Pottery Barn’s unique furnishings and accents. Taco Bell and Doritos teamed up to create the Doritos Locos Taco. Taco Bell sold more than 100 million of the tacos in just the first 10 weeks and quickly added Cool Ranch and Fiery versions and has since sold more than a billion. More than just co-branding, these companies are “co-making” these products.

Co-branding can take advantage of the complementary strengths of two brands. It also allows a company to expand its existing brand into a category it might otherwise have difficulty entering alone. For example, Nike and Apple co-branded the Nike+iPod Sport Kit, which lets runners link their Nike shoes with their iPods to track and enhance running performance in real time. The Nike+iPod arrangement gave Apple a presence in the sports and fitness market. At the same time, it helps Nike bring new value to its customers.
