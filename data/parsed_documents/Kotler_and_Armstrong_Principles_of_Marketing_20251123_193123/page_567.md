# 19 The Global Marketplace

> You’ve now learned the fundamentals of how companies develop competitive marketing strategies to engage customers, create customer value, and build lasting customer relationships. In this chapter, we extend these fundamentals to global marketing. Although we’ve discussed global topics in each previous chapter—it’s difficult to find an area of marketing that doesn’t contain at least some international elements—here we’ll focus on special considerations that companies face when they market their brands globally. Advances in communication, transportation, and digital technologies have made the world a much smaller place. Today, almost every firm, large or small, faces international marketing issues. In this chapter, we will examine six major decisions marketers make in going global.

> To start our exploration of global marketing, let’s look at Scandinavian furniture and housewares retailer IKEA. IKEA operates successfully in 51 countries, engaging consumers across vastly different means, languages, and cultures. IKEA follows a highly standardized international operating model designed to create good-quality, functional furniture at low prices that everyday people can afford. However, IKEA has learned that, when it comes to global markets, one size rarely fits all.

## IKEA: Just the Right Balance between Global Standardization and Local Adaptation

IKEA, the world’s largest furniture retailer, is the quintessential global cult brand. Last year, more than 771 million shoppers flocked to the Scandinavian retailer’s 368 huge stores in 51 countries, generating revenues of more than $37 billion. That’s an average of about $100 million per store annually, more than double Walmart’s average per-store sales. IKEA is big and getting bigger—its revenues have doubled during the past decade.

IKEA offers a classic model for how to do business in a global environment. Far more than just a big furniture merchant, IKEA has achieved global success by engaging consumers of all nationalities and cultures. From Beijing to Moscow to Middletown, Ohio, customers are drawn to the IKEA lifestyle, one built around trendy but simple and practical furniture at affordable prices. IKEA’s mission worldwide is to “create a better everyday life for the many people . . . by offering a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.”

IKEA succeeds globally by striking just the right balance between global standardization and local market adaptation. No matter where in the world you shop at IKEA, you’ll find huge stores, the familiar blue-and-yellow brand logo and signage, large selections of contemporary Scandinavian-design furnishings, and affordable prices. At the same time, IKEA carefully adapts its merchandise assortments, store operations, and marketing to cater to the unique needs of customers in different global markets characterized by vastly different means, languages, and cultures.

Many aspects of IKEA’s strategy are standard worldwide. For starters, all of its products are rooted in Swedish, contemporary design. Its classic, simple designs have a timeless, near-universal appeal. Low prices are another constant in IKEA’s global formula. As a benchmark, every IKEA product is designed to sell for half the price of similar competing products. IKEA keeps its prices low through a relentless focus on cost cutting. Selling largely standardized products worldwide helps keep costs down. So does IKEA’s space-saving “flat pack” approach—selling furniture in pieces to be assembled by customers at home.

IKEA’s stores around the world share a standardized design. All are gigantic. At an average size of 300,000 square feet, the average IKEA store is 50 percent larger than an average Walmart.
