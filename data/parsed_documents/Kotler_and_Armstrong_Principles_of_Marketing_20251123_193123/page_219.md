# 7.1 Mountain Dew: “Doin’ the Dew” with Brand Superfans

For example, take Jason Hemperly, the shy high school kid who had his grandmother make him a tuxedo for his prom out of flattened Mountain Dew cans. And Chester Atkins and his wife Amy who sport matching Mountain Dew tattoos and who toasted their marriage proposal with champagne flutes filled with the citrusy green drink. Then there’s Chris Whitley from Jackson, Mississippi, who drinks some 40 cans of Mountain Dew a week, keeps a copious collection of Mountain Dew T-shirts and hats, and absolutely worships NASCAR driver and Mountain Dew spokesman Dale Earnhardt Jr. “It’s pretty much a religious obsession for me, I guess,” says Whitley about Mountain Dew. “I just don’t drink anything else.”

Such fiercely loyal customers—who collectively make up the “Dew Nation”—have made Mountain Dew one of PepsiCo’s largest and fastest-growing brands. Mountain Dew’s avid superfans make up only 20 percent of its customers but consume a mind-boggling 70 percent of the brand’s total volume. Thanks to such fans, even as overall soft drink sales have lost their fizz during the past decade, Mountain Dew’s sales are bubbling over. The hugely popular $9 billion brand is now the nation’s number-three liquid refreshment, behind only behemoths Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

Such loyalty and sales don’t just flow automatically out of bottles and pop-top cans. Mountain Dew markets heavily to its superfans. The brand’s long-running “Do the Dew” slogan—what Mountain Dew calls its “iconic rallying cry and brand credo”—headlines the extreme moments and excitement behind the brand’s positioning. Mountain Dew spent an estimated $76 million on “Do the Dew” advertising and other brand content last year, 45 percent of it in digital media. One recent action-packed “Do the Dew” ad features professional skateboarder Sean Malto igniting a beach party bonfire by grinding over a line of matches. In another ad, Dale Earnhardt Jr., smokes his tires on a winding, wooded country road to lay down a smoke screen for his paintball team. The “Do the Dew” campaign is loaded with high-octane stunts. However, according to Mountain Dew’s chief marketer, the slogan is “more about enjoying the moment you’re in,” something highly relevant to the brand’s young, largely millennial-male target market.

But marketing to the Dew Nation explains only one part of Mountain Dew’s success. The real story revolves around the brand’s skill in fueling customer loyalty by actively engaging brand superfans and creating close brand community. Mountain Dew doesn’t just market *to* loyal customers; it makes them partners in building the brand and being part of the brand story.

For example, over the years, through several “DEWmocracy” campaigns, the company has involved Mountain Dew lovers in shaping the brand at all levels. Under DEWmocracy, the Dew Nation has participated via online and social media in everything from choosing and naming new flavors and designing the cans to submitting and selecting TV commercials and even picking an ad agency and media. DEWmocracy has produced hit flavors such as Voltage and White Out. More important, DEWmocracy has been a perfect forum for getting youthful, digitally-savvy Dew drinkers engaged with each other and the company, making the brand their own.

In creating engagement and community among loyal brand fans, Mountain Dew views itself as the ultimate lifestyle brand.

Offline, for more than a decade, Mountain Dew has teamed with NBC Sports to sponsor The Dew Tour, a slate of summer and winter action sports events in major cities across the country. At a Dew Tour, superfans can experience the adrenaline-packed Mountain Dew lifestyle firsthand and share their experiences with others in the Dew Nation.

Online, Mountain Dew’s dozens of web, mobile, and social media sites provide more by way of entertainment and community building than product information. For example, the main “Do the Dew” website serves as a lifestyle hub where super-passionate fans can check out the latest #dothedew programs, ads, and videos; hang out in the gaming section; and follow the adventures of Mountain Dew’s action sports athletes in skateboarding (Paul Rodriguez, Sean Malto, and Trevor Colden), snowboarding (Danny Davis and Scotty Lago), basketball (Russell Westbrook), racing (Dale Earnhardt Jr.), and even fishing (Gerald Swindle).

But the ultimate digital hangout for Mountain Dew superfans is a place called Green Label, a web and social media community created by Mountain Dew as a hub for youth culture, covering Dew-related content on sports, music, art, and style. Green Label “welcomes all kinds: derelict skaters, music nerds, and art doodlers, and focuses
