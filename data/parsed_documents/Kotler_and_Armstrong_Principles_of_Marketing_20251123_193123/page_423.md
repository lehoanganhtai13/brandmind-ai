# 14 Engaging Consumers and Communicating Customer Value  
## Integrated Marketing Communication Strategy

Companies must do more than just create customer value. They must also clearly and persuasively communicate that value. Promotion is not a single tool but rather a mix of several tools. Ideally, under the concept of *integrated marketing communications*, a company will carefully coordinate these promotion elements to engage customers and build a clear, consistent, and compelling message about an organization and its products.

We’ll begin by introducing the various promotion mix tools. Next, we’ll examine the rapidly changing communications environment—especially the addition of digital, mobile, and social media—and the need for integrated marketing communications. Finally, we discuss the steps in developing marketing communications and the promotion budgeting process. In the next three chapters, we’ll present the specific marketing communications tools: advertising and public relations (Chapter 15); personal selling and sales promotion (Chapter 16); and direct, online, mobile, and social media marketing (Chapter 17).

Let’s start by looking at a good integrated marketing communications campaign. In the fiercely competitive snack and candy industry, where well-established brands are fighting for survival, the inspired-yet-durable Snickers “You’re not you when you’re hungry” campaign has given the iconic brand new life. No matter where you see the message—on TV, on a mobile screen, in a friend’s post, or even on a Snickers candy bar wrapper—the imaginative campaign clearly and consistently drives home the brand’s “Snickers satisfies” and “You’re not you when you’re hungry” positioning in an engaging and memorable way. It has also made Snickers the world’s leading sweet snack.

## SNICKERS: “You’re Not You When You’re Hungry”

It all started with a now-classic Snickers ad in the 2010 Super Bowl. In the ad, during a neighborhood pickup football game, octogenarian Golden Girl Betty White appeared as a football player who was “playing like Betty White”—that is, very poorly. But after biting into a Snickers bar, she morphed back into a young, athletic footballer who played more like his usual self. The ad ended with the now-familiar slogan “You’re not you when you’re hungry” followed by the tagline “Snickers satisfies.”

> The enduring Snickers “You’re not you when you’re hungry” integrated marketing communications campaign clearly and consistently drives the brand’s “Snickers satisfies” positioning in an engaging and memorable way, helping to make Snickers the world’s leading sweet snack.

The Betty White ad generated tremendous buzz, reinvigorating the then-stagnant Snickers candy bar brand. According to Nielsen, it was the “best-liked spot” of that year’s Super Bowl, and it achieved the highest score on the *USA Today* Ad Meter rankings. The ad went viral, racking up tens of millions of views online and earning seemingly endless media attention. The “You’re not you when you’re hungry” slogan went on to become the cornerstone for a long-running, highly successful integrated marketing communications campaign that has propelled Snickers to the top of the global confectionary market.

Every great marketing communications campaign starts with a unique brand message, something that sets the brand apart. For decades, Mars has positioned Snickers on one overriding brand attribute: Snickers is satisfying. Heartier than most candy bars, Snickers combines ingredients like chocolate, nougat, and caramel with the protein power of peanuts. The “Snickers satisfies” tagline emphasizes the bar’s stomach-filling properties. Before the current campaign, Snickers pitched the bar to young athletic males as a meal alternative. One classic print ad, for example, showed an approving mother sending her son off to football practice with a Snickers bar.

But by the early 2000s, Snickers was in a rut. Its positioning had grown stale; its sales and market share had flattened.
