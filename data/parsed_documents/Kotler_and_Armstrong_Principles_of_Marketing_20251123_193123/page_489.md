salesperson who is pushing too hard to close a deal may ruin the customer relationship. Instead, companies are designing compensation plans that reward salespeople for building customer relationships and growing the long-run value of each customer.

When times get tough economically, some companies are tempted to cut costs by reducing sales compensation. However, although some cost-cutting measures make sense when business is sluggish, cutting sales force compensation across the board is usually an action of last resort. Top salespeople are always in demand, and paying them less might mean losing them at a time when they are needed most. Thus, short-changing key salespeople can result in short-changing important customer relationships. If the company must reduce its compensation expenses, rather than making across-the-board cuts, companies should continue to pay top performers well while turning loose low performers.

# Supervising and Motivating Salespeople

New salespeople need more than a territory, compensation, and training—they need supervision and motivation. The goal of *supervision* is to help salespeople “work smart” by doing the right things in the right ways. The goal of *motivation* is to encourage salespeople to “work hard” and energetically toward sales force goals. If salespeople work smart and work hard, they will realize their full potential—to their own and the company’s benefit.

## Supervising Salespeople

Companies vary in how closely they supervise their salespeople. Many help salespeople identify target customers and set call objectives. Some may also specify how much time the sales force should spend prospecting for new accounts and set other time management priorities. One tool is the weekly, monthly, or annual *call plan* that shows which customers and prospects to call on and which activities to carry out. Another tool is *time-and-duty analysis*. In addition to time spent selling, the salesperson spends time traveling, waiting, taking breaks, and doing administrative chores.

**Figure 16.2** shows how salespeople spend their time. On average, active selling time accounts for only 37 percent of total working time. Companies are always looking for ways to save time—simplifying administrative duties, developing better sales-call and routing plans, supplying more and better customer information, and using phone, email, online, or mobile conferencing instead of traveling.

This data illustrates the time allocation of salespeople, revealing a breakdown of their activities. The largest portion of time, 37.1%, is dedicated to **Active selling (face-to-face or phone)**, indicating direct customer interaction as the primary focus. Following this, 21.7% of their time is spent on **Researching accounts, pursuing leads**, highlighting the importance of lead generation and prospect qualification. **Post-sales tasks** account for 17.1%, suggesting a significant investment in customer retention and support. A smaller but notable segment, 13.9%, is allocated to **Meetings, administrative** duties, reflecting the operational overhead. Finally, **Travel, training** comprises the remaining 10%, underscoring the time commitment to professional development and logistical necessities. The structure is comparative, detailing the proportional distribution of a salesperson's working hours across distinct functional areas.

> This is far too little. Companies need to free up salespeople to spend much more face-to-face time with customers and prospects. For example, GE wants its salespeople to “spend four days a week in front of the customer and one day a week for all the admin stuff.” Many firms have adopted *sales force automation systems*: computerized, digitized sales force operations that let salespeople work more effectively anytime, anywhere.
