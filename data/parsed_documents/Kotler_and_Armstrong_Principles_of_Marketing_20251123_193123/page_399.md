# 13.1 Costco: Merchandising Magic That Competitors Can’t Match

It outsells Toys“R”Us in toys, gives Best Buy migraines in consumer electronics, sells more dog food than PetSmart or Petco, and dresses more people than Gap, American Eagle Outfitters, and Abercrombie & Fitch combined. With 24 percent of the grocery market, it sells far more groceries than leading grocery-only retailer Kroger. Almost every retailer, no matter what the category, has its hands full devising strategies by which it can compete with Walmart and survive.

But this isn’t a story about Walmart. It’s about Costco, the red-hot warehouse retailer that competes head-on with Walmart’s Sam’s Club—and wins. Sam’s Club is huge. With 652 stores and $57 billion in revenues, if Sam’s Club were a separate company, it would be the eighth-largest U.S. retailer. But when it comes to warehouse retailing, it’s Costco that’s the bully, not the other way around.

With only about 60 more stores than Sam’s Club, Costco has more than twice the revenues, and the revenue gap grows bigger every year. Costco’s $116 billion in sales makes it the world’s second-largest retailer, behind only Walmart. This year Costco moved up to number 18 among *Fortune* 500 companies. And unlike Sam’s Club, whose revenues are flat or falling, Costco’s sales are growing rapidly. In just the past four years, Costco’s revenues have surged 30 percent; profits are up 50 percent. How is Costco beating Sam’s Club at its own low-price game? The two retailers are very similar in many ways. But inside the store, Costco adds a certain merchandising magic that Sam’s Club just can’t match.

Let’s start with the similarities. Both Costco and Sam’s Club are warehouse retailers. They offer a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories at very low prices to shoppers who pay an annual membership fee. Both retailers stock about 4,000 items, often only jumbo sizes (a typical supermarket stocks 40,000 items; a Walmart supercenter about 150,000). And to keep costs and prices low, both operate out of big, drafty, bare-bones stores and use their substantial buying power to wring low prices from suppliers.

Price is an important part of the equation, and both Costco and Sam’s Club seem addicted to selling every item at the lowest possible price. But more than just focusing on low discount prices, Costco focuses on high value through low mark-ups, regardless of the ultimate price. From the beginning, *discount* has been a bad word at Costco—it denotes “cheap.” Instead, Costco’s strategy is to give customers the best value through low margins, whether it’s on a pantry staple or a high-priced wine. Costco’s operating profit margins average a razor-thin 3.1 percent. Then again, Sam’s Club’s margins are only 3.5 percent.

Thus, both Costco and Sam’s Club excel at low-cost operations and low prices. What is it, then, that really sets Costco apart? It has to do with Costco’s differentiated value proposition—with the products it carries and sense of urgency that it builds into the shopping experience. Whereas Sam’s Club and other wholesale retailers stand for low prices, Costco is a retail treasure hunt where both low-end and high-end products meet deep-discount prices. Alongside the gallon jars of peanut butter, four packs of toothpaste, and 2,250-count packs of Q-Tips that make other warehouse clubs popular, Costco offers an ever-changing assortment of high-quality products—even luxuries—all at tantalizingly low margins.

Last year, Costco sold more than 110 million hot dog–soda combos (still only $1.50, as they have been for more than three decades). At the same time, it sold more than 100,000 carats of diamonds at up to $100,000 per item. Costco is the nation’s biggest baster of poultry (nearly 70,000 rotisserie chickens a day at $4.99 and a million whole turkeys during a holiday season), but it’s also the country’s biggest seller of fine wines (including the likes of a Chateau Cheval Blanc Premier Grand Cru Classe at $1,750 a bottle). Just for the fun of it, a Costco in Arizona once sold an extremely limited-edition bottle of Macallan Lalique single-malt scotch for $17,000 (actually a $6,000 discount). And Costco.com once offered a Pablo Picasso drawing at only $129,999.99!

Costco brings flair to an otherwise-dreary setting. Mixed in with its regular stock of staples, Costco features a glittering, constantly shifting array of one-time specials on brands such as Andrew Marc, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Prada, and Breitling—deals you just won’t get anywhere else. It finds the best deals on premium electronics and appliances, then sells them at rock-bottom prices. In fact, 25 percent of the items that Costco carries are designated as “treasure items” (Costco’s words). The deals come and go quickly, and the changing assortment and great prices keep people coming back, wallets in hand.
