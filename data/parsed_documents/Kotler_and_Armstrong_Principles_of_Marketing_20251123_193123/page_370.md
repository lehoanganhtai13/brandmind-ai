# Marketing Channels: Delivering Customer Value

Then it might add an online store that sells directly to hard-to-reach customers. In this way, channel systems often evolve to meet market opportunities and conditions.

For maximum effectiveness, however, channel analysis and decision making should be more purposeful. **Marketing channel design** calls for analyzing consumer needs, setting channel objectives, identifying major channel alternatives, and evaluating the alternatives.

## Analyzing Consumer Needs

As noted previously, marketing channels are part of the overall *customer value delivery network*. Each channel member and level adds value for the customer. Thus, designing the marketing channel starts with finding out what target consumers want from the channel. Do consumers want to buy nearby, or are they willing to travel to more centralized locations? Would customers rather buy in person, by phone, or online? Do they value breadth of assortment, or do they prefer specialization? Do consumers want many add-on services (delivery, installation, repairs), or will they obtain these services elsewhere? The faster the delivery, the greater the assortment provided, and the more add-on services supplied, the greater the channel’s service level.

Providing the fastest delivery, the greatest assortment, and the most services, however, may not be possible, practical, or desired. The company and its channel members may not have the resources or skills needed to provide all the desired services. Also, higher levels of service result in higher costs for the channel and higher prices for consumers. The success of modern discount retailing shows that consumers often accept lower service levels in exchange for lower prices. For example, Walmart typically rates dead last in *Consumer Reports* rankings of grocery retailers on customer shopping experience and satisfaction compared to the likes of Wegmans, Publix, Kroger, Whole Foods, or about any other grocery retailer. Yet it captures a 25 percent share of the U.S. grocery market.

Many companies, however, position themselves on higher service levels, and customers willingly pay the higher prices. For example, whereas Walmart typically rates last in *Consumers Reports* rankings of grocery retailer customer satisfaction, East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans consistently ranks first:

> Wegmans prides itself on its broad and deep selection, clean stores, very high service levels, and well-trained and friendly employees. “Best supermarket around, hands down,” says one customer in a Yelp review. “The knowledge and helpfulness of the workers is beyond amazing.” Says another, “Aside from the overwhelming options of everything on the planet to choose from, it’s an amazing place. I walk around thinking…ok, I’m impressed!” The result is avidly loyal customers. Actor Alec Baldwin’s mother reportedly refused to move from New York to Los Angeles because she didn’t want to abandon her favorite Wegmans store. So even though they could probably save money by shopping at Walmart, to devoted Wegmans shoppers, the higher quality and extraordinary service are well worth the somewhat-higher prices.

Thus, companies must balance consumer needs not only against the feasibility and costs of meeting these needs but also against customer price preferences.

## Setting Channel Objectives

Companies should state their marketing channel objectives in terms of targeted levels of customer service. Usually, a company can identify several segments wanting different levels of service.
