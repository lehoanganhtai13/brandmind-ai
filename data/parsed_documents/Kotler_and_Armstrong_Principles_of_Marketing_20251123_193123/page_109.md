introduced its first on-pack sustainability logo in 2012 in order to help consumers choose products with sustainably sourced ingredients.

The PR campaign also included a communications manual defining the key messages for various communicators (marketing, chefs, etc.) and to differentiate between the ways of addressing target groups (consumers, journalists, NGOs, etc.). A “Town Vegetables/Allotment” event at the beginning of the campaign drew attention and consumer engagement. Consumers could apply as “city farmers” and grow their own vegetables in 100 gardens supplied by Knorr.

The central point in the campaign is the Knorr Chefs as brand ambassadors, integrated into all communications measures. Among Knorr’s other events, they play a central role in the “Knorr Market Day,” staged in the foyer of the Unilever House in Germany. Journalists, opinion-makers, staff, and consumers get to know the Knorr Chefs during a round table and at show-cooking. At market stands, guests can obtain information about Knorr products and the cultivation and processing of ingredients during talks with employees as well as with farmers and suppliers.

A word-of-mouth action whereby product testers were sought for the Knorr Gourmet Vine Tomato Soup, winner of a taste test from 13 packaged tomato soups, provided online entertainment and generated buzz. The launch is provided by a comprehensive press pack at the start of the initiative. Further press releases are on the subject of the work of the Chefs as product developers and brand ambassadors and inform about the progress made in sustainability commitment. The emphasis in the media work is on the press conference in the context of the Market Day with representatives of the company, Chefs, suppliers and farmers.

The Town Vegetables/Allotment event succeeded in addressing a relevant topic that consumers could relate to emotionally and which generated media interest. More than 7,000 applications were received. More than 100 reports, especially from media with broad coverage, successfully mediate the message. Knorr also chose well in launching a Facebook fan page: positive messages outnumbered the negative from the start, and interaction by the Knorr fans surpasses that of the fans of its direct competitor. The participation in actions and discussions with critical customers is lively and creates a positive resonance in the press. Knorr Market Day made a decisive contribution to the transparency and credibility of the communications and enabled high-value direct contact. The many media representatives and the several thousand consumers in attendance testified to the attraction and success of the event.

Unilever has been committed to sustainable agriculture since 1998 and has so far invested more than €25 million in research and development. This is also why the corporation is heading the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for the 15th time as the most sustainable company in the food sector. In Germany, Unilever was awarded the German Sustainability Prize 2012 in the “Most Sustainable Future Strategy” category. In addition, CEO Paul Polman has been awarded the United Nation’s highest environmental accolade, the Champion of the Earth Award, for leading the business world toward a new model of sustainable growth, which demonstrates that the transition to a sustainable and socially responsible economy is an opportunity to be seized, not a risk to be managed.

The technological environment changes rapidly, creating new markets and opportunities. However, every new technology replaces an older technology. Transistors hurt the vacuum-tube industry, digital photography hurt the film business, and digital downloads and streaming are hurting the DVD and book businesses. When old industries fight or ignore new technologies, their businesses decline. Thus, marketers should watch the technological environment closely. Companies that do not keep up will soon find their products outdated. If that happens, they will miss new product and market opportunities.

As products and technologies become more complex, the public needs to know that these items are safe. Thus, government agencies investigate and ban potentially unsafe products. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created complex regulations for testing new drugs. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) establishes safety standards for consumer products and penalizes companies that fail to meet them. Such regulations have resulted in much higher research costs and longer times between new product ideas and their introduction. Marketers should be aware of these regulations when applying new technologies and developing new products.

### Political environment

Laws, government agencies, and pressure groups that influence and limit various organizations and individuals in a given society.

> **Author Comment:** Even the strongest free-market advocates agree that the system works best with at least some regulation. But beyond regulation, most companies *want* to be socially responsible. We’ll dig deeper into marketing and social responsibility in Chapter 20.

# The Political–Social and Cultural Environments

## The Political and Social Environment

Marketing decisions are strongly affected by developments in the political environment. The **political environment** consists of laws, government agencies, and pressure groups that influence or limit various organizations and individuals in a given society.

### Legislation Regulating Business

Even the strongest advocates of free-market economies agree that the system works best with at least some regulation. Well-conceived regulation can encourage competition and ensure fair markets for goods and services. Thus, governments develop *public policy* to guide commerce—sets of laws and regulations that limit business for the good of society as a whole. Almost every marketing activity is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations.
