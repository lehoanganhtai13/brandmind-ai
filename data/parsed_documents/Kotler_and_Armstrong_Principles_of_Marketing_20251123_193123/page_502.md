# 16.2 Toyota’s Music Festival Strategy

Toyota Motor Corporation is among the top three automobile manufactures in the world along with Volkswagen and General Motors. Between 2008 and 2016, the Japanese car manufacturer was the top vehicle-selling company except for 2011, when it struggled to resume production after an earthquake struck Japan.

Toyota today has an extensive global reach and caters to diverse consumer preferences in different countries. The company has 53 manufacturing companies across 28 countries and regions. To serve its different markets, Toyota adapts its marketing efforts according to the market conditions. It has design and R&D bases in nine locations worldwide, demonstrating the effort to effectively meet the needs of its customers, from design and development to production and onward to sales and service.

Toyota’s marketing strategy has a strong focus on customer needs. The company believes that in an automobile sale, the benefits received should be in the following order: the customer first, then the car dealer, and the manufacturer, last. This attitude has helped the company to win the trust of customers and dealers and eventually brought growth to the manufacturer as well. A key focus of Toyota’s marketing strategy is on developing and maintaining an extensive network of dealerships across the globe and building its sales channels.

Toyota’s promotional strategy includes the use of all elements of the marketing communications mix. Toyota uses the following promotional activities in the order of importance: personal selling, advertising, public relations, sales promotions, and direct selling. Personal selling is carried out through the sales personnel of its dealers. The company advertises on various media, including TV, print and electronic media, websites and billboards. Toyota also uses PR that helps build its brand image, with activities like “Toyota TogetherGreen” program, which supports environmental initiatives, and the “Meal Per Hour” program, which donates food to Food Bank. The company occasionally uses sales promotions through special deals and conducts direct selling for corporate clients.

Toyota has worked to develop an extensive global network of dealers. In 2015, Toyota’s dealership network consisted of 280 dealers with 4,700 sales and service outlets in Japan. Out of these, 15 dealerships are owned by the company and the rest are independent. Within Japan, Toyota’s dealerships are divided into four sales channels: Toyota, Toyopet, Corolla, and Netz. Outside Japan, Toyota’s global sales network comprise more than 170 distributors in about 190 countries and regions. The region-wise number of Toyota’s distributors is North America (3), Latin America (43), Europe (27), Africa (49), Asia (17), China (4), Middle East (14), and Oceania (15). The distributors in their regions work as the main sales channel for Toyota and implement sales strategies that are sensitive to the needs of the local market. They have a key role in keeping Toyota connected with the market and able to adapt to market changes and customer needs. This helps Toyota to cultivate new fans by actively creating potential demand.

The company also realizes the importance of engaging its customers, especially the new generation of Millennials. In promoting its cars in different markets, Toyota uses various consumer engagement strategies, like its Music Festival. Toyota believes that music is a powerful tool to engage with a young and multicultural target audience and therefore finds music festival sponsorships and activations very useful to connect with the potential car buyers. The objective of participating in such festivals is to introduce the Toyota brand and its vehicles to the specific target market through hands-on and interactive demonstrations.

This creates an experiential marketing opportunity that stirs up excitement in consumers and encourages a positive brand attitude. In 2015, Toyota had a huge presence in rock festivals in the United States including Outside Lands, Life Is Beautiful, Lollapalooza, Bumbershoot, Voodoo Fest, Electric Forest, Firefly, Stagecoach, and Country Thunder. Toyota wants to do more than just to bring their vehicles to such events and park them; the company uses music festivals to deliver innovative execution of creative ideas while simultaneously using sales promotion techniques like giveaways and sampling through in-vehicle experiences, interactive elements, sweepstakes, competitions, and local promotions. Furthermore, Toyota’s state-of-the-art sound and entertainment systems and partnerships with SiriusXM and Pandora iHeartRadio become music boxes on wheels during such events. The following are the key components of Toyota’s Music Festival Strategy:

* **In-Vehicle Experiences:** The music festivals provide entertaining touch points for brand activation. The cars are used as props for photos as part of various activities and competitions during the festivals. For example, at the Toyota Music Den activation, festival attendees can get into a Toyota Corolla to take a kaleidoscope photo or inside a Crazy Candy Camry whose trunk was turned into a vending machine.

Toyota has sought new means of engagement that involve all the elements of the marketing communications mix. Helen Sessions/Alamy Stock Photo * Interactive Zones: These are on-site DIY (do-it-yourself) activities where festival goers can make items like posters, bandanas, tote bags, and other Toyota-branded stuff.
