Portfolio Manager Dan Tylman provided resources and support during the revision. Editorial Coordinator Linda Albelli and Project Manager Karin Williams provided valuable assistance and advice in guiding this complex revision project through development, design, and production. We’d also like to thank Director of Portfolio Management Stephanie Wall for her strong guidance and support along the way as well as the expertise of Managing Producer Ashley Santora, Director of Production Jeff Holcomb, and Product Marketer Becky Brown. We are proud to be associated with the fine professionals at Pearson. We also owe a mighty debt of gratitude to Senior Project Manager Charles Fisher, Associate Managing Editor Allison Campbell, Design Manager Emily Friel, and the rest of the team at Integra for their fine work on this edition.

Finally, we owe many thanks to our families for all of their support and encouragement—Kathy, Betty, Mandy, Matt, KC, Keri, Delaney, Molly, Macy, and Ben from the Armstrong clan and Nancy, Amy, Melissa, and Jessica from the Kotler family. To them, we dedicate this book.
