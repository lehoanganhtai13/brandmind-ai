# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines three key objectives related to understanding and responding to the competitive landscape in marketing. Objective 18-1 emphasizes the necessity of competitor analysis, highlighting its role alongside customer understanding in strategic planning. Objective 18-2 focuses on the foundational principles of competitive marketing strategies, specifically how they are built upon delivering customer value. Finally, Objective 18-3 addresses the crucial balance required between focusing on customers and competitors to achieve a truly market-centered organizational approach. The structure suggests a progression from understanding the competitive environment to developing strategies and then integrating these insights into a holistic market orientation.

Still, continued success will depend on the Microsoft’s ability to effectively adapt to—or even lead—the lightning-quick changes occurring in the marketing environment. “The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast,” says Microsoft’s CEO, “but to seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster, and continue to transform.”¹

# TODAY’S COMPANIES FACE THEIR toughest competition ever.

In previous chapters, we argued that to succeed in today’s fiercely competitive marketplace, companies must move from a product-and-selling philosophy to a customer-and-marketing philosophy.

This chapter spells out in more detail how companies can go about outperforming competitors to win, keep, and grow customers. To win in today’s marketplace, companies must become adept not only in managing products but also in managing customer relationships in the face of determined competition and a difficult marketing environment. Understanding customers is crucial, but it’s not enough. Building profitable customer relationships and gaining **competitive advantage** require delivering more value and satisfaction to target customers than competitors do. Customers will see competitive advantages as customer advantages, giving the company an edge over its competitors.

In this chapter, we examine competitive marketing strategies—how companies analyze their competitors and develop successful, customer value–based strategies for engaging customers and building profitable customer relationships. The first step is **competitor analysis**, the process of identifying, assessing, and selecting key competitors. The second step is developing **competitive marketing strategies** that strongly position the company against competitors and give the company the strongest possible strategic advantage.

## Competitor Analysis

To plan effective marketing strategies, a company needs to find out all it can about its competitors. It must constantly compare its marketing strategies, products, prices, channels, and promotions with those of close competitors. In this way, the company can find areas of potential competitive advantage and disadvantage. As shown in **Figure 18.1**, competitor analysis involves first identifying and assessing competitors and then selecting which competitors to attack or avoid.
