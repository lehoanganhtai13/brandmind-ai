# Omni-channel retailing

BUY ONLINE, PICK UP IN STORE.  
*Omni-channel retailing: Home Depot’s goal is to provide “a seamless and frictionless experience no matter where our customers shop, be it in the digital world, our brick and mortar stores, at home, or on the job site. Anywhere the customer is, we need to be there.”*

Staples captures about 22 percent of its sales online; at Williams-Sonoma, it’s more than 50 percent.

In fact, **omni-channel retailing** companies are having as much online success as their online-only competitors. U.S. home-improvement retailer Home Depot has more than 2,200 stores, including 182 in Canada, selling everything a do-it-yourself home renovator might need.

While sheets of plywood and nails are hardly items you might imagine a company selling online, online sales are Home Depot’s hottest growth area, growing at a rate of nearly 40 percent annually over the past 5 years.  
🔵 Home Depot is now one of the world’s top 10 online merchants, with an online inventory exceeding 1 million products, compared with the 40,000 or so products available in a typical Home Depot store.

The home-improvement retailer offers multiple contact points and delivery modes. Customers can buy products off the shelf in any Home Depot store or can buy products online from the virtual shelves of Home Depot’s website. Products ordered online can still be delivered, but more than 40 percent of online orders are now picked up in store.

Retailers around the world are recognizing that customers are changing how they shop. Australia’s major department store Myer and major clothing retailer Sportscraft offer their customers the option of purchasing products in-store or online with traditional postal delivery. Both retailers also offer a “click and collect” option, whereby customers can select products off each retailers’ virtual shelves and then check to see if they are available at a retail outlet of their choosing, anywhere in Australia. If their product selection is available, transactions are completed online and products are ready for collection at the selected outlet at a time of the customer’s convenience, saving customers additional delivery charges. Products not available at local retail outlets can, of course, still be home delivered. Australian consumers can even click and collect their groceries, including fresh produce and frozen foods, by placing their orders online at Australia’s two major supermarkets, Woolworth’s and Coles, for pick-up later, effectively having their own personal grocery shopper!

Direct digital and social media marketing takes any of the several forms shown in Figure 17.1. These forms include online marketing, social media marketing, and mobile marketing. We discuss each in turn, starting with online marketing.

# Online Marketing

**Online marketing** refers to marketing via the internet using company websites, online advertising and promotions, email marketing, online video, and blogs. Social media and mobile marketing also take place online and must be closely coordinated with other forms of digital marketing. However, because of their special characteristics, we discuss the fast-growing social media and mobile marketing approaches in separate sections.

## Websites and Branded Web Communities

For most companies, the first step in conducting online marketing is to create a website. Websites vary greatly in purpose and content. Some websites are primarily **marketing websites**, designed to engage customers and move them closer to a direct purchase or other marketing outcome.

For example, car companies like Hyundai operate marketing websites. Once a potential customer clicks in to Hyundai’s site, the carmaker wastes no time trying to turn the inquiry into a sale and then into a long-term relationship. The site opens with a promotional message, then offers a garage full of useful information and interactive selling features, including detailed descriptions of current Hyundai models, tools for designing your own Hyundai, an area to calculate the trade-in value of your current car, information on dealer locations and services, and even a place to request a quote online. Inventory search and schedule a test drive features encourage customers to take the plunge and visit a Hyundai dealership.

In contrast, **brand community websites** do much more than just sell products. Instead, their primary purpose is to present brand content that engages consumers and creates customer–brand community. Such sites typically offer a rich variety of brand information, videos, blogs, activities, and other features that build closer customer relationships and generate engagement with and between the brand and its customers. For example, at Sephora’s Beauty Talk site, visitors can interact with like-minded people to explore and
