# Learning

**Learning** describes changes in an individual’s behavior arising from experience. Learning theorists say that most human behavior is learned. Learning occurs through the interplay of drives, stimuli, cues, responses, and reinforcement.

A *drive* is a strong internal stimulus that calls for action. A drive becomes a motive when it is directed toward a particular *stimulus object*. For example, a person’s drive for self-actualization might motivate him or her to look into buying a camera. The consumer’s response to the idea of buying a camera is conditioned by the surrounding cues. *Cues* are minor stimuli that determine when, where, and how the person responds. The camera buyer might spot several camera brands in a shop window, hear of a special sale price, or discuss cameras with a friend. These are all cues that might influence a consumer’s *response* to his or her interest in buying the product.

Suppose the consumer buys a Nikon camera. If the experience is rewarding, the consumer will probably use the camera more and more, and his or her response will be *reinforced*. Then the next time he or she shops for a camera, or for binoculars or some similar product, the probability is greater that he or she will buy a Nikon product. The practical significance of learning theory for marketers is that they can build up demand for a product by associating it with strong drives, using motivating cues, and providing positive reinforcement.

# Beliefs and Attitudes

Through doing and learning, people acquire beliefs and attitudes. These, in turn, influence their buying behavior. A **belief** is a descriptive thought that a person holds about something. Beliefs may be based on real knowledge, opinion, or faith and may or may not carry an emotional charge. Marketers are interested in the beliefs that people formulate about specific products and services because these beliefs make up product and brand images that affect buying behavior. If some of the beliefs are wrong and prevent purchase, the marketer will want to launch a campaign to correct them.

People have attitudes regarding religion, politics, clothes, music, food, and almost everything else. **Attitude** describes a person’s relatively consistent evaluations, feelings, and tendencies toward an object or idea. Attitudes put people into a frame of mind of liking or disliking things, of moving toward or away from them. Our camera buyer may hold attitudes such as “Buy the best,” “The Japanese make the best camera products in the world,” and “Creativity and self-expression are among the most important things in life.” If so, the Nikon camera would fit well into the consumer’s existing attitudes.

Attitudes are difficult to change. A person’s attitudes fit into a pattern; changing one attitude may require difficult adjustments in many others. Thus, a company should usually try to fit its products into existing attitude patterns rather than attempt to change attitudes. Of course, there are exceptions. Repositioning or extending a brand calls for changing attitudes. For example, consider the Burberry brand:  

> When you think of Burberry now, you probably think of a luxury high-fashion label, its signature trench coats, and its association with celebrities like Kate Moss. However, this very profitable positioning is the result of an extensive brand overhaul. The company started out in 1856 and over time become a glamorous fashion label worn by the rich and famous. In the years leading up to 2006, when Angela Ahrendts became CEO, the brand’s image had slid downmarket as their distinct beige/red/black check pattern had become associated with the chav culture and football hooliganism. The far-reaching sale of licences over the years had resulted in products as diverse as disposable nappies for dogs featuring its trademark. While the global market was booming, Burberry only grew by 2 percent annually. Existing attitudes towards the brand needed to be changed to make it successful again.  
>  
> Angela Ahrendts started the turnaround by buying back licences, thereby re-centralizing control over the brand. For its repositioning, she decided to go back to Burberry’s roots, reclaiming its luxury authenticity, reviving its high-quality heritage, and focusing less on the famous check pattern. In support of this revamped positioning, Burberry launched modern campaigns targeting luxury customers with its core, classic high-fashion products augmented by a modern twist, enlisting the help of celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Romeo Beckham.

We can now appreciate the many forces acting on consumer behavior. The consumer’s choice results from the complex interplay of cultural, social, personal, and psychological factors.
