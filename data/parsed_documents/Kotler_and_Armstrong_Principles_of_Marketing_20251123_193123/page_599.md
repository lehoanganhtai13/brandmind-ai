# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This table outlines five learning objectives related to sustainable marketing, presented in a hierarchical structure. It begins with defining sustainable marketing and its significance (Objective 20-1), followed by an examination of major social criticisms leveled against marketing practices (Objective 20-2). The subsequent objectives delve into consumer-driven movements, specifically defining consumerism and environmentalism and their impact on marketing strategies (Objective 20-3). The table then shifts to business-oriented actions, describing the principles of sustainable marketing (Objective 20-4). Finally, it concludes by emphasizing the crucial role of ethics within the context of marketing and the sustainable company (Objective 20-5). Each objective is linked to specific topics and page ranges within the source material, indicating a progression from foundational concepts to more applied and ethical considerations.

“We do not believe there is a conflict between sustainability and profitable growth,” he concludes. “The daily act of making and selling consumer goods drives economic and social progress. There are billions of people around the world who deserve the better quality of life that everyday products like soap, shampoo, and tea can provide. Sustainable living is not a pipedream. It can be done, and there is very little downside.”[^1]

> **RESPONSIBLE MARKETERS DISCOVER WHAT** consumers want and respond with market offerings that create value for buyers and capture value in return. The *marketing concept* is a philosophy of customer value and mutual gain. Its practice leads the economy by an invisible hand to satisfy the many and changing needs of consumers.  
> Not all marketers follow the marketing concept, however. In fact, some companies use questionable marketing practices that serve their own rather than consumers’ interests. Moreover, even well-intentioned marketing actions that meet the current needs of some consumers may cause immediate or future harm to other consumers or the larger society. Responsible marketers must consider whether their actions are sustainable in the longer run.  
> This chapter examines sustainable marketing and the social and environmental effects of private marketing practices. First, we address the question: What is sustainable marketing, and why is it important?
