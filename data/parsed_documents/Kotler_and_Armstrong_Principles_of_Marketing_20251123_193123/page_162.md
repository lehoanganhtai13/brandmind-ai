# Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

Consumers are heavy users of digital and social media, providing access through a rich variety of marketing channels.  
Many companies develop special products, appeals, and marketing programs for African American consumers—from carmakers like Ford and Hyundai to consumer products companies like P&G to even not-for-profits and government agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service.  

For example, the U.S. Forest Service and the Ad Council recently joined forces to create the “Discover the Forest” public service campaign to raise awareness among families of the benefits for children of getting outside and enjoying nature. One round of the campaign specifically targeted the parents of African American tweens:

> Although more than 245 million Americans live within 100 miles of a national forest or grassland, research shows that a majority of children in some population segments are not spending active time outdoors. For example, only 37 percent of African American children ages 6 to 12 participate frequently in outdoor activities compared with 67 percent of the broader U.S. population in that age group. To help close that gap, the U.S. Forest Service and the Ad Council created the “Discover the Forest” campaign, a series of public service messages ranging from billboards and radio commercials to interactive social media and website content. With headlines such as “Unplug,” “Where Curiosity Blooms,” and “Where Imagination Sprouts,” the ads targeting African American families promote the discovery and imagination wonders of connecting with the great outdoors and the resulting physical, mental health, and emotional well-being benefits. “The forest is one of those amazing places where kids can flex their imagination muscles through exploration and discovery,” says a marketer associated with the campaign.

### Asian American Consumers

Asian Americans are the most affluent U.S. demographic segment. A relatively well-educated segment, they now number more than 18.5 million (5 percent of the population), with annual buying power expected to approach $1 trillion by 2018. Asian Americans are the second-fastest-growing subsegment after Hispanic Americans. And like Hispanic Americans, they are a diverse group. Chinese Americans constitute the largest group, followed by Filipinos, Asian Indians, Vietnamese, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans. Yet, unlike Hispanics who all speak various dialects of Spanish, Asians speak many different languages. For example, ads for the 2010 U.S. Census ran in languages ranging from Japanese, Cantonese, Khmer, Korean, and Vietnamese to Thai, Cambodian, Hmong, Hinglish, and Taglish.

As a group, Asian American consumers shop frequently and are the most brand conscious of all the ethnic groups. They can be fiercely brand loyal, especially to brands that work to build relationships with them. As a result, many firms now target the Asian American market. For example, many retailers, especially luxury retailers such as Bloomingdale’s, now feature themed events and promotions during the Chinese New Year, a spending season equivalent to the Christmas holidays for Chinese American consumers. They hire Mandarin-speaking staff, offer Chinese-themed fashions and other merchandise, and feature Asian cultural presentations. Bloomingdale’s has even introduced seasonal, limited edition pop-up shops in many stores around the country:

> Richly designed in red, gold, and black motifs, Chinese colors of good fortune, the Bloomingdale’s pop-up boutiques feature high-end Chinese-themed fashions and other merchandise created especially for the Chinese New Year celebration. Some locations sponsor entertainment such as lion dancers, Chinese tarot card readings, calligraphy, lantern making, tea tastings, and free Zodiac nail art. Shoppers in some stores are invited to select Chinese red envelopes with prizes such as gift cards in denominations of $8, $88, or $888 (eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture). In addition to the pop-up boutiques, Bloomingdale’s celebrates the days and weeks leading up to the Chinese New Year with Chinese-language ads and promotions in carefully targeted traditional and online media. The retailer also has 175 Chinese-speaking associates across the country. “Chinese customers, including both tourists as well as Chinese Americans, are an important part of the overall Bloomingdale’s business,” says the retailer’s CEO.
