The winning product. The goal of the Future Show Challenge is to “cajole top innovators to come to Under Armour first with gee-whizzers,” says CEO Kevin Plank. The first winner, and Plank’s favorite so far, is a made-for-athletes zipper—the UA MagZip—that can be zipped easily with only one hand. Under Armour’s internal R&D team had been trying to develop a better zipper for two years, but “we couldn’t get it to work,” says the company’s vice president of innovation. That simple zipper is just one of dozens of creative new product ideas from the Future Show. But by itself, it makes the entire crowdsourcing effort worthwhile. “We need to be humble enough to know that the next great thing might come from some kid playing college football who happens to have a better idea,” says the Under Armour innovation chief.

Crowdsourcing can produce a flood of innovative ideas. In fact, opening the floodgates to anyone and everyone can overwhelm the company with ideas—some good and some bad. For example, when Cisco Systems sponsored an open-innovation effort called I-Prize, soliciting ideas from external sources, it received more than 820 distinct ideas from more than 2,900 innovators from 156 countries. “The evaluation process was far more labor-intensive than we’d anticipated,” says Cisco’s chief technology officer. It required “significant investments of time, energy, patience, and imagination . . . to discern the gems hidden within rough stones.” In the end, a team of six Cisco people worked full-time for three months to carve out 32 semifinalist ideas as well as nine teams representing 14 countries in six continents for the final phase of the competition.  
Thus, truly innovative companies don’t rely only on one source or another for new product ideas. Instead, they develop extensive innovation networks that capture ideas and inspiration from every possible source, from employees and customers to outside innovators and multiple points beyond.

### Idea Screening

The purpose of idea generation is to create a large number of ideas. The purpose of the succeeding stages is to *reduce* that number. The first idea-reducing stage is **idea screening**, which helps spot good ideas and drop poor ones as soon as possible. Product development costs rise greatly in later stages, so the company wants to go ahead only with those product ideas that will turn into profitable products.

Many companies require their executives to write up new product ideas in a standard format that can be reviewed by a new product committee. The write-up describes the product or the service, the proposed customer value proposition, the target market, and the competition. It makes some rough estimates of market size, product price, development time and costs, manufacturing costs, and rate of return. The committee then evaluates the idea against a set of general criteria.

One marketing expert describes an R-W-W (“real, win, worth doing”) new product screening framework that asks three questions.  
First, *Is it real?* Is there a real need and desire for the product, and will customers buy it? Is there a clear product concept, and will such a product satisfy the market?  
Second, *Can we win?* Does the product offer a sustainable competitive advantage? Does the company have the resources to make such a product a success?  
Finally, *Is it worth doing?* Does the product fit the company’s overall growth strategy? Does it offer sufficient profit potential? The company should be able to answer yes to all three R-W-W questions before developing the new product idea further.

### Concept Development and Testing

An attractive idea must then be developed into a **product concept**. It is important to distinguish between a product idea, a product concept, and a product image. A *product idea* is an idea for a possible product that the company can see itself offering to the market.
