and keep it from sinking into decline. To reawaken the brand, Quaker launched a major new “Quaker Up” marketing campaign, supported by an estimated $100 million budget.²²

The “Quaker Up” campaign targets a new market of young mothers under 35, positioning Quaker’s lines of hot and cold cereals, snack bars, cookies, and other products as healthy lifestyle choices that help give a young family the fuel and energy needed to get through the day. The campaign advises families to “Quaker Up—with Quaker’s good energy for the moments that matter.” As part of the retargeting and repositioning effort, Quaker has modernized every element of the brand, from products and packaging to in-store displays and ad platforms. To start, it slimmed down the iconic Quaker man by 20 pounds and gave him a facelift to make him look healthier, stronger, and more contemporary. The brand added new energy-packed products, such as Quaker Medleys—a hearty blend of oats and grains with real fruit and nuts; Quaker Soft Baked Bars—high in fiber, protein, and B vitamins; and Quaker Protein—protein-packed instant oatmeal and baked energy bars. Befitting the more mobile and connected lifestyles of today’s young parents, the “Quaker Up” campaign also incorporates a healthy dose of digital media, including banner ads, YouTube videos, a Facebook app, a Quaker Up community website, and a full slate of other digital content. In all, despite its age, the reenergized Quaker brand now has a much younger appeal. “People know the brand, people love the brand, but we needed to forge a stronger connection with contemporary moms,” says Quaker’s chief marketing officer.

## Decline Stage

The sales of most product forms and brands eventually dip. The decline may be slow, as in the cases of stamps and oatmeal cereal, or rapid, as in the cases of VHS tapes. Sales may plunge to zero, or they may drop to a low level where they continue for many years. This is the **decline stage**.

Sales decline for many reasons, including technological advances, shifts in consumer tastes, and increased competition. As sales and profits decline, some firms withdraw from the market. Those remaining may prune their product offerings. In addition, they may drop smaller market segments and marginal trade channels, or they may cut the promotion budget and reduce their prices further.

Carrying a weak product can be very costly to a firm, and not just in profit terms. There are many hidden costs. A weak product may take up too much of management’s time. It often requires frequent price and inventory adjustments. It requires advertising and sales-force attention that might be better used to make “healthy” products more profitable. A product’s failing reputation can cause customer concerns about the company and its other products. The biggest cost may well lie in the future. Keeping weak products delays the search for replacements, creates a lopsided product mix, hurts current profits, and weakens the company’s foothold on the future.

For these reasons, companies must identify products in the decline stage and decide whether to maintain, harvest, or drop them. Management may decide to **maintain** its brand, repositioning or reinvigorating it in hopes of moving it back into the growth stage of the product life cycle. P&G has done this with several brands, including Mr. Clean and Old Spice. Over the past decade, P&G has retargeted, repositioned, revitalized, and extended both of these old brands, taking each from near extinction to billion-dollar-brand status.

Management may decide to **harvest** the product, which means reducing various costs (plant and equipment, maintenance, R&D, advertising, sales force), hoping that sales hold up. If successful, harvesting will increase the company’s profits in the short run. Finally, management may decide to **drop** the product from its line. The company can sell the product to another firm or simply liquidate it at salvage value. If the company plans to find a buyer, it will not want to run down the product through harvesting. In recent years, P&G has sold off several declining brands and brands that no longer fit strategically, such as Folgers coffee, Crisco oil, Comet cleanser, Sure deodorant, Noxema, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Cover Girl and Max Factor cosmetics, Duracell batteries, Iams pet foods, and others.²³
