# Table 13.3 | Major Types of Wholesalers (Continued)

This table outlines different types of wholesale intermediaries, categorizing them by their operational structure and relationship with buyers and sellers. Purchasing agents typically maintain long-term buyer relationships, handling procurement, inspection, warehousing, and shipping. Commission merchants, often used in agriculture, take physical possession of goods, negotiate sales, deduct commissions and expenses, and remit the balance to producers. Manufacturers' and retailers' branches and offices represent integrated wholesaling operations, either for sales or purchasing, conducted by the buyer or seller themselves. Within this category, sales branches, which carry inventory, are established by manufacturers for inventory control, selling, and promotion, while sales offices, which do not carry inventory, focus on sales and promotion. Purchasing offices, functioning similarly to brokers or agents, are part of the buyer's organization, often established by retailers in major market centers.

> Merchant wholesalers include two broad types: full-service wholesalers and limited-service wholesalers. *Full-service wholesalers* provide a full set of services, whereas the various *limited-service wholesalers* offer fewer services to their suppliers and customers. The different types of limited-service wholesalers perform varied specialized functions in the distribution channel.

> **Brokers** and **agents** differ from merchant wholesalers in two ways: They do not take title to goods, and they perform only a few functions. Like merchant wholesalers, they generally specialize by product line or customer type. A **broker** brings buyers and sellers together and assists in negotiation. **Agents** represent buyers or sellers on a more permanent basis. *Manufacturers’ agents* (also called *manufacturers’ representatives*) are the most common type of agent wholesaler. The third major type of wholesaling is that done in **manufacturers’ and retailers’ branches and offices** by sellers or buyers themselves rather than through independent wholesalers.

> **Broker**  
> A wholesaler who does not take title to goods and whose function is to bring buyers and sellers together and assist in negotiation.

> **Agent**  
> A wholesaler who represents buyers or sellers on a relatively permanent basis, performs only a few functions, and does not take title to goods.

> **Manufacturers’ and retailers’ branches and offices**  
> Wholesaling by sellers or buyers themselves rather than through independent wholesalers.

# Wholesaler Marketing Decisions

Wholesalers now face growing competitive pressures, more-demanding customers, new technologies, and more direct-buying programs on the part of large industrial, institutional, and retail buyers. As a result, they have taken a fresh look at their marketing strategies. As with retailers, their marketing decisions include choices of segmentation and targeting, differentiation and positioning, and the marketing mix—product and service assortments, price, promotion, and distribution (see green circle Figure 13.2).

# Segmentation, Targeting, Differentiation, and Positioning Decisions

Like retailers, wholesalers must segment and define their target markets and differentiate and position themselves effectively—they cannot serve everyone. They can choose a target group by size of customer (for example, large retailers only), type of customer (convenience stores only), the need for service (customers who need credit), or other factors. Within the target group, they can identify the more profitable customers, design stronger offers, and build better relationships with them. They can propose automatic reordering systems, establish management-training and advisory systems, or even sponsor a voluntary chain. They can discourage less-profitable customers by requiring larger orders or adding service charges to smaller ones.
