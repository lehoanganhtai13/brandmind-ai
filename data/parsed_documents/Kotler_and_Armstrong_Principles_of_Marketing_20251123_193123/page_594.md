# Marketing Ethics  
## Cleaning Up the Chinese Pharmaceutical Market

Pharmaceutical businesses from around the world have recognized the potential of the market and, at the same time, existing Chinese businesses have realized the potential threats to their market share. In order to grab some market share and profit, some pharmaceutical companies have been less than honest in their dealings and have subsequently found themselves under intense scrutiny from China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). In 2016, the NDRC fined five domestic pharmaceutical companies over $600,000 for fixing their prices. This was part of the continuing battle to keep medicine prices at affordable levels. The five companies had colluded between April 2014 and September 2015 to raise the price of a drug used to treat kidney diseases. China has 1.4 billion potential customers, and the drug market was growing at 20 percent a year; it has now slowed to 5 percent.

The Chinese government is keen to stamp out corruption, but corruption is ingrained and persistent. China ranks 79th out of 175 countries on the Transparency International Index 2016, which tracks corruption across a variety of business markets. In one corruption case, the corruption took place outside of the normal parameters of business dealings; the individuals made deals outside the company’s systems. In this particular case, there was a 30 percent drop in sales as the company scaled back in order to ensure it had oversight of all aspects of business operations in China. If foreign companies are found by the NDRC to be giving out bribes, then it is not just a question of business as usual after paying the fine; they must also repair their reputations.

# Marketing by the Numbers  
## Attracting Alternative Markets

Some 18 million tourists visited Greece during 2014—a figure approaching twice the population of Greece. Only 50 years ago, the country was attracting around 33,000 tourists a year. Tourism has wrought fundamental changes in Greece; it has had a massive social and financial impact on the country. Yet Greece still struggles to manage and promote its tourism industry. According to the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, tourism in Greece peaked in 1990, about the same time as tourism worldwide reached a peak. Over the years, Greece has welcomed tourists who have been interested in very different things, culminating in mass tourism, which has been in decline for the past decade. With a poor economic outlook, Greece needs to look for alternatives and seize on them quickly before their competitors do.

- **19-13** Develop a relevant demographic profile of a potential new market for a country like Greece that is looking to attract alternative tourist markets.
