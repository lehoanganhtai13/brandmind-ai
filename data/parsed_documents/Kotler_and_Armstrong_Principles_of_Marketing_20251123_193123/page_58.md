# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge

In the summer of 2014, people with connections to ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) raised awareness of the condition by urging people to post videos of themselves dumping buckets of ice water over their heads and challenge others to do the same. The efforts raised millions of dollars in online donations to the ALS Association for enhanced research and patient services. This real-time marketing campaign generated 17 million videos uploaded to social media platforms from 159 countries. Celebrities posting videos included Will Smith, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, and Mark Zuckerberg. The Ice Bucket Challenge generated 70 billion video views while raising $220 million. The best part? Zero dollars were spent to promote the Ice Bucket Challenge, yet 440 million people saw it. The ALS Association has now turned the wildly successful challenge into an annual social media campaign, bringing back the original Ice Bucket Challenge #EveryAugustUntilACure.
