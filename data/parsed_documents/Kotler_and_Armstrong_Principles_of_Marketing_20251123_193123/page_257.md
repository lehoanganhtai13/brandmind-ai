# Product Line Decisions

A **product line** is a group of products that are closely related because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same types of outlets, or fall within given price ranges. For example, Nike produces several lines of athletic shoes and apparel, and Marriott offers several lines of hotels.

The major product line decision involves *product line length*—the number of items in the product line. The line is too short if the manager can increase profits by adding items; the line is too long if the manager can increase profits by dropping items. Managers need to analyze their product lines periodically to assess each item’s sales and profits and understand how each item contributes to the line’s overall performance.

A company can expand its product line in two ways: by *line filling* or *line stretching*.  
*Product line filling* involves adding more items within the present range of the line. There are several reasons for product line filling: reaching for extra profits, satisfying dealers, using excess capacity, being the leading full-line company, and plugging holes to keep out competitors. However, line filling is overdone if it results in cannibalization (eating up sales of the company’s own existing products) and customer confusion. The company should ensure that new items are noticeably different from existing ones.

*Product line stretching* occurs when a company lengthens its product line beyond its current range. The company can stretch its line downward, upward, or both ways. Companies located at the upper end of the market can stretch their lines *downward*. For example, Mercedes has stretched downward with the CLA line to draw in younger, first-time buyers. A company may stretch downward to plug a market hole that otherwise would attract a new competitor or to respond to a competitor’s attack on the upper end. Or it may add low-end products because it finds faster growth taking place in the low-end segments. Companies can also stretch their product lines *upward*. Sometimes, companies stretch upward to add prestige to their current products or to reap higher margins. P&G did that with brands such as Cascade dishwashing detergent and Dawn dish soap by adding “Platinum” versions at higher price points.

As they grow and expand, many companies both stretch and fill their product lines. Consider BMW:

Over the years, BMW Group has transformed itself from a single-brand, five-model automaker into a powerhouse with three brands, 14 “Series,” and dozens of distinct models. The company has expanded downward with its MINI Cooper line and upward with Rolls-Royce. Its BMW line brims with models from the low end to the high end to everything in between.

> The brand’s seven “Series” lines range from the entry-level 1-Series subcompact to the luxury-compact 3-Series to the midsize 5-Series sedan to the luxurious full-size 7-Series. In between, BMW has filled the gaps with its X1, X3, X4, X5, and X6 SUVs; M-Series performance models; the Z4 roadster; and the i3 and i8 hybrids. Thus, through skillful line stretching and filling, while staying within its premium positioning, BMW now has brands and lines that successfully appeal to the rich, the super-rich, and the hope-to-be-rich.

# Product Mix Decisions

An organization with several product lines has a product mix. A **product mix** (or **product portfolio**) consists of all the product lines and items that a particular seller offers for sale. For example, Colgate-Palmolive is perhaps best known for its toothpaste and other oral care products. But, in fact, Colgate is a $17.3 billion consumer products company that makes and markets a full product mix.
