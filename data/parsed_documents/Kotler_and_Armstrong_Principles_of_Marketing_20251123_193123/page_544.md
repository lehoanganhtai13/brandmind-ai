# Steps in Analyzing Competitors

> Identifying competitors isn’t as easy as it seems. For example, Kodak saw other camera film makers as its major competitors. But its real competitors turned out to be the makers of digital cameras that used no film at all. Kodak fell behind in digital technologies and ended up declaring bankruptcy.

This table outlines a three-stage strategic process for competitor analysis. The initial stage involves **Identifying** the company’s competitors, establishing the scope of the competitive landscape. Following this, the core of the analysis focuses on **Assessing** competitors’ objectives, strategies, strengths and weaknesses, and reaction patterns, aiming to understand their current and future intentions and capabilities. The final stage culminates in **Selecting** which competitors to attack or avoid, based on the insights gained from the assessment, thereby guiding strategic resource allocation and competitive engagement. This structured approach moves from broad identification to detailed assessment and finally to strategic decision-making regarding competitive interactions.

Thus, Forever 21 might see H&M as a major competitor, but not Nordstrom or Target. The Ritz-Carlton might see the Four Seasons hotels as a major competitor, but not Holiday Inn, Hampton Inn, or any of the thousands of bed-and-breakfasts that dot the nation.

However, companies actually face a much wider range of competitors. The company might define its competitors as all firms with the same product or class of products. Thus, the Ritz-Carlton would see itself as competing against all other hotels. Even more broadly, competitors might include all companies making products that supply the same service. Here the Ritz-Carlton would see itself competing not only against other hotels but also against anyone who supplies rooms for busy travelers. Finally, and still more broadly, competitors might include all companies that compete for the same consumer dollars. Here the Ritz-Carlton would see itself competing with travel and leisure products and services, from cruises and summer homes to vacations abroad.

Companies must avoid “competitor myopia.” A company is more likely to be “buried” by its latent competitors than its current ones. For example, Kodak didn’t lose out to competing film makers such as Fuji; it fell to the makers of digital cameras that use no film at all (see Real Marketing 18.1). And once-blazing-hot video-rental superstore Blockbuster didn’t go bankrupt at the hands of other traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. It fell victim first to unexpected competitors such as direct marketer Netflix and kiosk marketer Redbox and then to a host of new digital video streaming services and technologies. By the time Blockbuster recognized and reacted to these unforeseen competitors, it was too late.

Companies can identify their competitors from an *industry* point of view. They might see themselves as being in the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry, or the beverage industry. A company must understand the competitive patterns in its industry if it hopes to be an effective player in that industry. Companies can also identify competitors from a *market* point of view. Here they define competitors as companies that are trying to satisfy the same customer need or build relationships with the same customer group.

From an industry point of view, Google once defined its competitors as other search engine providers such as Yahoo! or Microsoft’s Bing. Now, Google takes a broader view of serving market needs for online and mobile access to the digital world. Under this market definition, Google squares off against once-unlikely competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, and even Amazon and Facebook.

In general, the market concept of competition opens the company’s eyes to a broader set of actual and potential competitors. ● For example, from an industry view, Cinnabon long defined itself as a mall- and airport-based fresh baked goods chain. Adopting a market view, however, let the brand grow into a much broader competitive arena against consumer packaged goods competitors:

Market-based competitive definition: By changing to a market concept of competition—selling “irresistible indulgence”—Cinnabon has grown into a much broader competitive arena. Some 75 percent of the brand’s total revenues now come from licensed consumer packaged goods. FOCUS Brands

Cinnabon has long been known for its ginormous “World Famous Cinnamon Rolls,” creations that radiate that enticing Cinnabon aroma at your local mall or airport. But from a broader market view, Cinnabon realized that it doesn’t just sell cinnamon rolls in malls. Instead, it sells “irresistible indulgence,” with attributes such as “aroma,” “soft,” “moist,” and “indulgent.” Cinnabon fans “wanted the flavors of Cinnabon in other sorts of occasions where they indulge,” says the brand’s CEO. This realization led to an expansion.
