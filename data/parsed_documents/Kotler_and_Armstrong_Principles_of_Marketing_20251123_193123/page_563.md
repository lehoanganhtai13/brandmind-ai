### I’ll Eat My Hat

The online resource www.veravo.com offers a fascinating insight into the minds of Internet users in the United Arab Emirates. The service tracked the top 20 Google AdWords that appear at the top, bottom, or alongside the regular list. Advertisers pay when their advertisements are clicked. The advertiser creates an account with Google and sets the maximum bid they are willing to pay per click. The position of the advertisement is worked out as a combination of the pay-per-click bid and the quality of the “landing page.” In effect, the position is auctioned off by Google. As a result, advertisers will fight over the top spot by outbidding one another. The most expensive AdWords was found to be fedora, referring to the hat of the same name, worth an incredible $17.40 per click. At $8.62 was the phrase “hair transplant in Dubai.” Running about equal in terms of cost per click were “Gucci,” “blonde hair,” and “liposuction.” Also valued in excess of $7 were “rhinoplasty,” “breast augmentation,” “Dubai investments,” “laser hair removal,” “diamond sizes,” and perhaps most bizarrely, the U.S. professional wrestler “Daniel Bryan.” As a snapshot of the obsessions of a nation, Google AdWords is not a strictly scientific measure, but it does give a very different insight into what is hot and what is not in the search engine world.

**18-9** What do you think the identified AdWords tell us about the United Arab Emirates? Are the words really representative of the interests of the country’s population? (AACSB: Written and Oral Communication; Reflective Thinking)

**18-10** Globally, Google AdWords is worth 68 percent of Google’s income. Google is making over $120 million a day. What are the advantages and disadvantages of AdWords? (AACSB: Written and Oral Communication; Reflective Thinking)

## Marketing Ethics  
### Creating Competitive Advantage . . . to What End?

In late September 2015, Volkswagen found itself in the midst of a firestorm. The company, which captures 70 percent of the U.S. diesel-powered passenger-car market, was caught cheating on diesel emissions tests. Over the past many years, Volkswagen had installed software on more than half a million diesel cars in the United States—and roughly 10.5 million more worldwide—that detected when the cars were undergoing emissions tests and triggered so-called “defeat devices” that temporarily switched operating modes and allowed them to pass the tests. VW diesel autos were found to actually be emitting up to 40 times the allowable levels of nitrogen oxide pollutants.

Volkswagen has long pitched its diesel cars as efficient, non-polluting vehicles. But in 2008, when U.S. rules on diesel exhaust became stricter, VW faced difficulties meeting the new standards and living up to its “clean diesel” advertising promises and image. So, under competitive pressures, it covertly installed the secret “defeat devices.” When the scandal broke, Volkswagen’s global sales plunged along with its reputation. The company halted sales of affected diesel models and suspended all of its “clean diesel” marketing and advertising. To mitigate the damage, Volkswagen created a “Customer Goodwill Package” in which it doled out $1,000 in cash and dealership purchases to VW diesel owners along with access to free 24-hour roadside assistance for three years. It also reached a more than $15 billion settlement with U.S. regulators to cover the costs of possible vehicle buybacks and other remedial actions. The full long-run harm to VW’s reputation and market performance remains to be seen.

**18-11** Is Volkswagen a competitor-centered company, customer-centered company, or market-centered company? Explain your answer. (AACSB: Communication, Reflective Thinking)

**18-12** What competitive thinking moved Volkswagen, one of the world’s major automakers, to cheat on emission standards rather than comply with them? How could Volkswagen have prevented this scandal, and what are the lessons for other firms? (AACSB: Ethical Reasoning, Communication)

## Marketing by the Numbers  
### Market Share

Bottled water is a hot industry with sales of $11.8 billion in the United States. Big players in this industry include Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola. Nestlé is the market leader with four brands in the top 10 leading brands. Nestlé’s Pure Life brand was the top-selling brand with sales of $1.18 billion, but the company’s other brands make up an additional $1.6 billion, giving the company total overall sales of almost $3 billion. Nestlé saw opportunity in this market and launched a new brand.
