Multiply by price to determine dollar sales needed to achieve a $5 million profit:

$$
\text{Dollar sales} = 581,396 \text{ units} \times \$168 = \$97,674,528
$$

Or use the contribution margin:

$$
\text{Sales} = \frac{\text{fixed cost} + \text{profit goal}}{\text{contribution margin}} = \frac{\$20,000,000 + \$5,000,000}{0.256} = \$97,656,250
$$

Again, note that the difference between the two break-even sales calculations is due to rounding.

As we saw previously, a profit goal can also be stated as a return on investment goal. For example, recall that HD wants a 30% return on its $10 million investment. Thus, its absolute profit goal is $3 million ($10,000,000 \times 0.30). This profit goal is treated the same way as in the previous example:  

$$
\text{Unit volume} = \frac{\text{fixed cost} + \text{profit goal}}{\text{price} - \text{variable cost}} = \frac{\$20,000,000 + \$3,000,000}{168 - 125} = 534,884 \text{ units}
$$

$$
\text{Dollar sales} = 534,884 \text{ units} \times \$168 = \$89,860,512
$$

Or

$$
\text{Dollar sales} = \frac{\text{fixed cost} + \text{profit goal}}{\text{contribution margin}} = \frac{\$20,000,000 + \$3,000,000}{0.256} = \$89,843,750
$$

Finally, HD can express its profit goal as a percentage of sales, which we also saw in previous pricing analyses. Assume HD desires a 25% return on sales. To determine the unit and sales volume necessary to achieve this goal, the calculation is a little different from the previous two examples. In this case, we incorporate the profit goal into the unit contribution as an additional variable cost. Look at it this way: If 25% of each sale must go toward profits, that leaves only 75% of the selling price to cover fixed costs. Thus, the equation becomes:

$$
\text{Unit volume} = \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{price} - \text{variable cost} - (0.25 \times \text{price})} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{(0.75 \times \text{price}) - \text{variable cost}}
$$

So,

$$
\text{Unit volume} = \frac{20,000,000}{(0.75 \times 168) - 125} = 20,000,000 \text{ units}
$$

$$
\text{Dollar sales necessary} = 20,000,000 \text{ units} \times 168 = 3,360,000,000
$$

Thus, HD would need more than $3 billion in sales to realize a 25% return on sales given its current price and cost structure! Could it possibly achieve this level of sales? The major point is this: Although break-even analysis can be useful in determining the level of sales needed to cover costs or to achieve a stated profit goal, it does not tell the company whether it is *possible* to achieve that level of sales at the specified price. To address this issue, HD needs to estimate demand for this product.

Before moving on, however, let’s stop here and practice applying the concepts covered so far. Now that you have seen pricing and break-even concepts in action as they relate to HD’s new product, here are several exercises for you to apply what you have learned in other contexts.

## Marketing by the Numbers Exercise Set One

Now that you’ve studied pricing, break-even, and margin analysis as they relate to HD’s new product launch, use the following exercises to apply these concepts in other contexts.

**1.1** Elkins, a manufacturer of ice makers, realizes a cost of $250 for every unit it produces. Its total fixed costs equal $5 million. If the company manufactures 500,000 units, compute the following:  
a. unit cost  
b. markup price if the company desires a 10% return on sales  
c. ROI price if the company desires a 25% return on an investment of $1 million A gift shop owner purchases items to sell in her store.
