Another example is the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a global not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is to conserve nature and protect the world’s wildlife. WWF operates in 100 countries under funding from government grants, foundations, corporations, and individuals—1.2 million members in the United States and nearly 5 million members worldwide. WWF uses sophisticated marketing to raise the considerable resources it needs to accomplish its sweeping mission. Just one example is the WWF’s recent cost-efficient but effective #LastSelfie Snapchat campaign:

> The idea behind the WWF #Last Selfie campaign is that the world’s endangered wildlife species are disappearing from the earth as quickly as a Snapchat. To make the point, WWF sent nine-second Snapchat pictures of endangered animals to WWF followers worldwide with the message “Don’t let this be my #LastSelfie,” urging recipients to take a screenshot. Within only eight hours, the campaign generated 5,000 tweets viewed on 6 million timelines. Within only a week, there were 40,000 tweets reaching 120 million users. In all, the #LastSelfie campaign reached more than half of all Twitter users. It also helped WWF to meet its monthly donation target in just three days and led to a record number of animal adoptions through WWF’s website. More broadly, thanks to such marketing efforts and despite its limited marketing budget, WWF raised nearly $290 million in funds last year, more than a third of it from individual donors.

Government agencies have also shown an increased interest in marketing. For example, the U.S. military has a marketing plan to attract recruits to its different services, and various government agencies are now designing social marketing campaigns to encourage energy conservation and concern for the environment or discourage smoking, illegal drug use, and obesity. Even the once-stodgy U.S. Postal Service has developed innovative marketing to sell commemorative stamps, promote its Priority Mail services, and lift its image as a contemporary and competitive organization. In all, the U.S. government is the nation’s 39th largest advertiser, with an annual advertising budget of more than $980 million.³⁷

## Rapid Globalization

As they are redefining their customer relationships, marketers are also taking a fresh look at the ways in which they relate with the broader world around them. Today, almost every company, large or small, is touched in some way by global competition. A neighborhood florist buys its flowers from Mexican nurseries, and a large U.S. electronics manufacturer competes in its home markets with giant Korean rivals. A fledgling internet retailer finds itself receiving orders from all over the world at the same time that an American consumer goods producer introduces new products into emerging markets abroad.

American firms have been challenged at home by the skillful marketing of European and Asian multinationals. Companies such as Toyota, Nestlé, and Samsung have often outperformed their U.S. competitors in American markets. Similarly, U.S. companies in a wide range of industries have developed truly global operations, making and selling their products worldwide. Quintessentially American McDonald’s now serves 70 million customers daily in more than 36,000 local restaurants in more than 100 countries worldwide—68 percent of its corporate revenues come from outside the United States. Similarly, Nike markets in 190 countries, with non-U.S. sales accounting for 52 percent of its worldwide sales.³⁸ Today, companies are not just selling more of their locally produced goods in international markets; they are also sourcing more supplies and components abroad and developing new products for specific markets around the world.

Thus, managers in countries around the world are increasingly taking a global, not just local, view of the company’s industry, competitors, and opportunities. They are asking: What is global marketing? How does it differ from domestic marketing? How do global competitors and forces affect our business? To what extent should we “go global”? We will discuss the global marketplace in more detail in Chapter 19.
