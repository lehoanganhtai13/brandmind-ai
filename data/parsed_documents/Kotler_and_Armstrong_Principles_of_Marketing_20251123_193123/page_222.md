# Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

Since 1919, Bentley Motors has produced luxury automobiles known for their distinctive design, handcrafted luxury, and a refined but exhilarating driving experience. Given its high price, Bentley Motors has focused on economically developed markets such as the United States and Europe, positioning itself on luxury, prestige, and exclusivity, but most importantly its “Britishness.” When sales slumped in response to the 2008 financial crisis, Bentley began a search for new markets. Using cross-market segmentation, Bentley shifted its focus from targeting affluent markets to targeting affluent consumers. This allowed the company to identify and then capitalize on the burgeoning purchasing power in the high-income segments of emerging markets such as Russia and China, markets that Bentley had previously not considered given their overall low per capita incomes. Bentley Motors now targets affluent consumers regardless of the market, who demand and are willing to pay for the superior-quality, quintessentially British luxury automobiles and driving experience the company has always produced.

## Requirements for Effective Segmentation

Clearly, there are many ways to segment a market, but not all segmentations are effective. For example, buyers of table salt could be divided into blonde and brunette customers. But hair color obviously does not affect the purchase of salt. Furthermore, if all salt buyers bought the same amount of salt each month, believed that all salt is the same, and wanted to pay the same price, the company would not benefit from segmenting this market.

To be useful, market segments must be  
* **Measurable.** The size, purchasing power, and profiles of the segments can be measured.  
* **Accessible.** The market segments can be effectively reached and served.  
* **Substantial.** The market segments are large or profitable enough to serve. A segment should be the largest possible homogeneous group worth pursuing with a tailored marketing program. It would not pay, for example, for an automobile manufacturer to develop cars especially for people whose height is greater than seven feet.  
* **Differentiable.** The segments are conceptually distinguishable and respond differently to different marketing mix elements and programs. If men and women respond similarly to marketing efforts for soft drinks, they do not constitute separate segments.  
* **Actionable.** Effective programs can be designed for attracting and serving the segments. For example, although one small airline identified seven market segments, its staff was too small to develop separate marketing programs for each segment.

> **Author Comment:** After dividing the market into segments, it’s time to answer that first seemingly simple marketing strategy question we raised in Figure 7.1: Which customers will the company serve?

## Market Targeting

Market segmentation reveals the firm’s market segment opportunities. The firm now has to evaluate the various segments and decide how many and which segments it can serve best. We now look at how companies evaluate and select target segments.

### Evaluating Market Segments

In evaluating different market segments, a firm must look at three factors: segment size and growth, segment structural attractiveness, and company objectives and resources. First, a company wants to select segments that have the right size and growth characteristics. But “right size and growth” is a relative matter.
