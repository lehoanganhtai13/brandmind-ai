# 12 Marketing Channels  
## Delivering Customer Value

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

We now look at the third marketing mix tool—distribution. Companies rarely work alone in engaging customers, creating customer value, and building profitable customer relationships. Instead, most are only a single link in a larger supply chain and marketing channel. As such, a firm’s success depends not only on how well *it* performs but also on how well its *entire marketing channel* competes with competitors’ channels. The first part of this chapter explores the nature of marketing channels and the marketer’s channel design and management decisions. We then examine physical distribution—or logistics—an area that has grown dramatically in importance and sophistication. In the next chapter, we’ll look more closely at two major channel intermediaries: retailers and wholesalers.

We start by looking at Uber, the fast-growing, app-based car-hailing service that has recently sprouted up in cities around the world. Uber has radically reinvented urban transportation channels, posing a serious threat to conventional taxicab and car service companies. As Uber grows, traditional competitors must innovate or risk being pushed aside.

## UBER: Radically Reshaping Urban Transportation Channels

It’s rare. But every now and then a company comes along that completely disrupts the traditional ways of distributing a product or service. FedEx revolutionized small package delivery channels, Amazon.com radically transformed online selling, and Apple’s iTunes and iPod turned music distribution on its ear. Now comes Uber, the app-based ride service that is revolutionizing urban transportation. Fast-growing Uber is giving conventional taxicab and car services a real ride for their money. In just seven short years, Uber has revved up operations in hundreds of major cities in 67 countries, already booking more than $10 billion in rides annually through its massive network of more than a million drivers.

Why are so many customers around the world bypassing good old taxicabs in favor of newcomer Uber? It’s all about convenience and peace of mind. No more stepping out into busy city streets to wave down a passing cab. Instead, Uber’s smartphone app lets passengers hail the nearest cab or limo from any location, then track the vehicle on a map as it approaches. The Uber app gives riders an accurate estimate in advance of the fare to their destinations (usually less than that charged by a regular cab), eliminating guesswork and uncertainty. After the ride, passengers simply exit and walk away. Uber automatically pays the driver (including tip) from the passenger’s prepaid Uber account, eliminating the often-inconvenient and awkward moment of payment. And it’s the same process anywhere in the world, from San Francisco, London, Paris, or Abu Dhabi to Ashville, North Carolina, or Athens, Georgia.

Compare the Uber experience to the uncertain and often-unsettling experience of using a standard taxicab. One business reporter describes waiting in line at a taxi stand while a driver tried to convince another would-be passenger—a total stranger—to share the cab, thereby increasing his fare. The cab itself was ancient and filthy, with ripped and worn seats. During the entire ride, the cabbie carried on a phone conversation in a foreign language via his headset, causing safety concerns while distractedly navigating busy city streets. The driver spoke only poor, hard-to-understand English. “That turned out to be a good thing,” says the reporter, “because I couldn’t understand what he was trying to say when he insulted me for not tipping him enough.” The reporter’s conclusion: “I stepped out of the taxi in front of my house and realized I just don’t have to put up with this garbage anymore.
