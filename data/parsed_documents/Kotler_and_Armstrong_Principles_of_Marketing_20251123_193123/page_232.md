For example, East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans has long been recognized as a customer service champ with a cult-like loyalty among its shoppers. The secret to its extraordinary customer service lies in its carefully selected, superbly trained, happy employees, who personify Wegmans’s commitment to customers: “Everyday You Get Your Best.” For example, the chain’s cashiers aren’t allowed to interact with customers until they’ve had at least 40 hours of training. “Our employees are our number one asset,” says the chain’s vice president for human resources.28

Even when competing offers look the same, buyers may perceive a difference based on company or brand *image differentiation*. A company or brand image should convey a product’s distinctive benefits and positioning. Developing a strong and distinctive image calls for creativity and hard work. A company cannot develop an image in the public’s mind overnight by using only a few ads. If Ritz-Carlton means quality, this image must be supported by everything the company is, says, and does.

Symbols, such as the McDonald’s golden arches, the colorful Google logo, the Twitter bird, the Nike swoosh, or Apple’s “bite mark” logo, can provide strong company or brand recognition and image differentiation. The company might build a brand around a famous person, as Nike did with its Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James basketball shoe and apparel collections. Some companies even become associated with colors, such as Coca-Cola (red), IBM (blue), or UPS (brown). The chosen symbols, characters, and other image elements must be communicated through advertising that conveys the company’s or brand’s personality.

## Choosing the Right Competitive Advantages

Suppose a company is fortunate enough to discover several potential differentiations that provide competitive advantages. It now must choose the ones on which it will build its positioning strategy. It must decide how many differences to promote and which ones.

### How Many Differences to Promote.

Many marketers think that companies should aggressively promote only one benefit to the target market. Former advertising executive Rosser Reeves, for example, said a company should develop a *unique selling proposition* (USP) for each brand and stick to it. Each brand should pick an attribute and tout itself as “number one” on that attribute. Buyers tend to remember number one better, especially in this overcommunicated society. Thus, Walmart promotes its unbeatable low prices and Burger King promotes personal choice—“have it your way.”

Other marketers think that companies should position themselves on more than one differentiator. This may be necessary if two or more firms are claiming to be best on the same attribute. For example, with its “Expect More. Pay Less.” positioning, Targets sets itself apart from Walmart by adding a touch of class to its low prices. And Microsoft differentiates its innovative Surface tablet as being both a laptop and tablet in one. It’s the “One device for everything in your life”—lighter and thinner than a laptop but with a click-in keyboard and fuller features than competing tablets. It’s “Powerful as a laptop, lighter than Air.” Microsoft’s challenge is to convince buyers that it’s one brand can do it all.

Today, in a time when the mass market is fragmenting into many small segments, companies and brands are trying to broaden their positioning strategies to appeal to more segments.

### Which Differences to Promote.

Not all brand differences are meaningful or worthwhile, and each difference has the potential to create company costs as well as customer benefits. A difference is worth establishing to the extent that it satisfies the following criteria:

* *Important.* The difference delivers a highly valued benefit to target buyers.  
* *Distinctive.* Competitors do not offer the difference, or the company can offer it in a more distinctive way.  
* *Superior.* The difference is superior to other ways that customers might obtain the same benefit.  
* *Communicable.* The difference is communicable and visible to buyers.  
* *Preemptive.* Competitors cannot easily copy the difference.  
* *Affordable.* Buyers can afford to pay for the difference.  
* *Profitable.* The company can introduce the difference profitably.
