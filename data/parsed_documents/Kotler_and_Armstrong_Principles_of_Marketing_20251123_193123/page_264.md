# Products, Services, and Brands: Building Customer Value

For example, many grocery chains now offer online shopping and home delivery as a better way to shop than having to drive, park, wait in line, and tote groceries home. And most banks offer mobile phone apps that allow you to more easily transfer money, check account balances, and make mobile check deposits. “Sign, snap a photo, and submit a check from anywhere,” says one Citibank ad. “It’s easier than running to the bank.”

Finally, service companies also can work on differentiating their *images* through symbols and branding. Aflac adopted the duck as its advertising symbol. Today, the duck is immortalized through stuffed animals, golf club covers, and free ringtones and screensavers. The well-known Aflac duck helped make the big but previously unknown insurance company memorable and approachable. Other well-known service characters and symbols include the GEICO gecko, Progressive Insurance’s Flo, McDonald’s golden arches, Allstate’s “good hands,” the Twitter bird, and the freckled, red-haired, pig-tailed Wendy’s girl. Progressive’s Flo has amassed more than 5 million Facebook Likes.

## Managing Service Quality

A service firm can differentiate itself by delivering consistently higher quality than its competitors provide. Like manufacturers before them, most service industries have now joined the customer-driven quality movement. And like product marketers, service providers need to identify what target customers expect in regard to service quality.

Unfortunately, service quality is harder to define and judge than product quality. For instance, it is harder to agree on the quality of a haircut than on the quality of a hair dryer. Customer retention is perhaps the best measure of quality; a service firm’s ability to hang onto its customers depends on how consistently it delivers value to them.

Top service companies set high service-quality standards. They watch service performance closely, both their own and that of competitors. They do not settle for merely good service—they strive for 100 percent defect-free service. A 98 percent performance standard may sound good, but using this standard, the U.S. Postal Service would lose or misdirect 356,000 pieces of mail each hour, and U.S. pharmacies would misfill more than 1.5 million prescriptions each week.  

Unlike product manufacturers who can adjust their machinery and inputs until everything is perfect, service quality will always vary, depending on the interactions between employees and customers. As hard as they may try, even the best companies will have an occasional late delivery, burned steak, or grumpy employee. However, good *service recovery* can turn angry customers into loyal ones. In fact, good recovery can win more customer purchasing and loyalty than if things had gone well in the first place.

Emirates prides itself on providing a high level of customer service and has won various awards for its service quality. Blue dot To enhance its customer satisfaction, Emirates actively seeks customer feedback. It has a dedicated help center that encourages its customers to give feedback, make inquiries about flights, or make a complaint on any aspect of its service that they do not find satisfactory. The feedback collected through its help center is used to enhance customers’ experience across various stages of the service encounter, from flight booking to check-in, baggage drop, boarding, plane conditions, inflight services such as food and beverage, entertainment and shopping, to disembarkation and final baggage claim.

These days, social media such as Facebook and Twitter can help companies root out and remedy customer dissatisfaction with service. As discussed in Chapter 4, companies now monitor the digital space to spot customer issues quickly and respond in real time. For example, Southwest has a dedicated team of 29 people who respond to roughly 80,000 Facebook and Twitter posts monthly. A quick and thoughtful response can turn a dissatisfied customer into a brand advocate.

## Managing Service Productivity

With their costs rising rapidly, service firms are under great pressure to increase service productivity. They can do so in several ways. They can train current employees better or hire new ones who will work harder or more skillfully. Or they can increase the quantity of their service by giving up some quality.
