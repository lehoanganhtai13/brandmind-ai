A **public** is any group that has an actual or potential interest in or impact on an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives. We can identify seven types of publics:

* *Financial publics.* This group influences the company’s ability to obtain funds. Banks, investment analysts, and stockholders are the major financial publics.
* *Media publics.* This group carries news, features, editorial opinions, and other content. It includes television stations, newspapers, magazines, and blogs and other social media.
* *Government publics.* Management must take government developments into account. Marketers must often consult the company’s lawyers on issues of product safety, truth in advertising, and other matters.
* *Citizen-action publics.* A company’s marketing decisions may be questioned by consumer organizations, environmental groups, minority groups, and others. Its public relations department can help it stay in touch with consumer and citizen groups.
* *Internal publics.* This group includes workers, managers, volunteers, and the board of directors. Large companies use newsletters and other means to inform and motivate their internal publics. When employees feel good about the companies they work for, this positive attitude spills over to the external publics.
* *General public.* A company needs to be concerned about the general public’s attitude toward its products and activities. The public’s image of the company affects its buying behavior.
* *Local publics.* This group includes local community residents and organizations. Large companies usually work to become responsible members of the local communities in which they operate.

NatWest, one of the leading UK banks, maintains a strong link with its local community through various cause-related activities. In 2016, across the group, the organization gave a whooping £2.5 million to local charities, community groups, and social enterprises both in the United Kingdom and in Ireland. A further £2.5 million has been earmarked to be spent on similar endeavors in the year 2017. Meanwhile, the commitment of the bank to supporting local communities is not only displayed in the organizations’ corporate efforts but also flows down to the staff members, who are very enthusiastic in supporting various local charities through their concerted efforts. 

In 2015, the staff of the bank donated a total of £2.7 million to charity through the Pay-as-You-Earn Scheme and contributed 45,437 hours of volunteering for various communities and charity projects. The same year, it became an official sponsor of Sports Relief. Over the years, it has been celebrated for supporting many other local charities to improve life, including Porchlight for the homeless, Discovery Park for tenants, and UKSA, a Youth charity. Its link to the Prince’s Trust spans over 16 years, through which it has helped thousands of disadvantaged young people to create sustainable businesses. In 2014 alone, it ran an employability and mentoring program for 2,521 disadvantaged people through hours devoted to the Trust.

A company can prepare marketing plans for these major publics as well as for its customer markets.
