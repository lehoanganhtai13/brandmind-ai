## Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

For existing sales personnel, SunGard revised procedures, metrics, training, and tools to make them consistent across the organization. It also made major revisions to its Salesforce CRM and sales management tool with an eye toward providing salespeople with all the information they needed for every aspect of the sales process. The important tool now provided easy and immediate access to content such as case studies, customer information, and market data. Additional tools were made available to guide people through the necessary steps of effectively closing a sale.

But to improve effectiveness for both new and existing sales personnel, SunGard needed to make even more changes in how it measured and tracked performance. For example, prior to the transformation, the company tracked incentives and commissions manually, and they were not readily accessible by relevant stakeholders. Under the new scheme, metrics such as individual goals and forecasts, as well as how often sales were made or lost, became part of an automated system, accessible by sales reps and managers via mobile interface at any time. They could even run “what-if” scenarios to determine potential earnings of different situations. This capability motivated sales reps by increasing accountability and promoting a competitive spirit.

### From Transformation to Results

As the new sales structure and tools took root, it wasn’t long before they began to bear fruit. “There was a tremendous product suite that had yet to capture its full market share,” says Todd Albright, who joined SunGard as senior vice president of sales for the Americas after the transformation was under way. That market share will soon be achieved. “There were tremendous assets locked up at SunGard,” Neve summarizes. “We put a road map in place to unlock those assets, translating them into new sales and revenue growth.”

With its billion-dollar sales plan now in place, SunGard is on target. As one example, consider the productivity improvements for first-year reps. Prior to the transformation, about 75 percent of new reps booked their first sale before the end of their first year at an average of about $400,000. Through the new policies, that sales productivity has doubled, adding an incremental $30 to $40 million to annual sales.

If boosting sales force effectiveness was easy, every company would achieve optimal sales force productivity. SunGard was willing to pay the price. In the first year following the implementation of the transformation, as expected, SunGard revenues decreased over the previous year—down by about 16 percent. However, profits rose by nearly 35 percent, thanks in part to reduced costs from more efficient operations. By the end of the second year, revenues were back on the rise. Fradin was notably pleased. “Clients are responding positively to these initiatives, knowing that our offerings help their businesses be more competitive. We [are] particularly pleased with our sales momentum and our organic revenue growth.”

Importantly, SunGard’s sales force is now much more coordinated and collaborative. It’s better trained and equipped to sell based on insights. Its products and services are bundled across product lines rather than within lines. And reps are developing partnerships with customers, assisting them in streamlining operations, accelerating growth, and complying with regulations. By transforming its sales force to “Selling the SunGard Way,” SunGard is on a path to sustainable, organic growth for years to come.
