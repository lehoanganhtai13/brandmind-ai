However, HD estimates that HD2 will generate the 200,000 of cannibalized sales plus an *additional* 500,000 unit sales. Thus, the contribution on these additional HD2 units will be $10 million (i.e., 500,000 units × $20 per unit = $10 million). The net effect is that HD will gain $7 million in total contribution by introducing HD2.

The following table compares HD’s total contribution with and without the introduction of HD2:

This table presents a comparative analysis of total contribution based on the involvement of two entities, HD1 and HD2. The structure is comparative, examining two distinct scenarios: "HD1 only" and "HD1 and HD2." In the "HD1 only" scenario, HD1 contributes 600,000 units at $35 each, totaling $21,000,000, with no contribution from HD2. Conversely, when both HD1 and HD2 are involved, HD1's contribution is reduced to 400,000 units at $35 each, amounting to $14,000,000. Simultaneously, HD2 contributes 700,000 units at $20 each, also totaling $14,000,000. The combined total contribution in the "HD1 and HD2" scenario is $28,000,000, which is higher than the $21,000,000 generated by HD1 alone.

The difference in the total contribution is a net gain of $7 million ($28 million − $21 million). Based on this analysis, HD should introduce the HD2 model because it results in a positive incremental contribution. However, if fixed costs will increase by more than $7 million as a result of adding this model, then the net effect will be negative and HD should not pursue this tactic.

Now that you have seen these marketing tactic analysis concepts in action as they related to HD’s new product, here are several exercises for you to apply what you have learned in this section in other contexts.

## Marketing by the Numbers Exercise Set Three

**3.1** Alliance, Inc. sells gas lamps to consumers through retail outlets. Total industry sales for Alliance’s relevant market last year were $100 million, with Alliance’s sales representing 5% of that total. Contribution margin is 25%. Alliance’s sales force calls on retail outlets and each sales rep earns $50,000 per year plus 1% commission on all sales. Retailers receive a 40% margin on selling price and generate average revenue of $10,000 per outlet for Alliance.  
a. The marketing manager has suggested increasing consumer advertising by $200,000. By how much would dollar sales need to increase to break even on this expenditure? What increase in overall market share does this represent?  
b. Another suggestion is to hire two more sales representatives to gain new consumer retail accounts. How many new retail outlets would be necessary to break even on the increased cost of adding two sales reps?  
c. A final suggestion is to make a 10% across-the-board price reduction. By how much would dollar sales need to increase to maintain Alliance’s current contribution? (See endnote 13 to calculate the new contribution margin.)  
d. Which suggestion do you think Alliance should implement? Explain your recommendation.

**3.2** PepsiCo sells its soft drinks in approximately 400,000 retail establishments, such as supermarkets, discount stores, and convenience stores. Sales representatives call on each retail account weekly, which means each account is called on by a sales rep 52 times per year. The average length of a sales call is 75 minutes (or 1.25 hours). An average salesperson works 2,000 hours per year (50 weeks per year × 40 hours per week), but each spends 10 hours a week on non-selling activities, such as administrative tasks and travel. How many sales people does PepsiCo need?
