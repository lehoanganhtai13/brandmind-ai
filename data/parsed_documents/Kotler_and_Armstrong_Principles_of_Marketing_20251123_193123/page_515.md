# Benefits of Direct and Digital Marketing to Buyers and Sellers

They give buyers anywhere, anytime access to an almost unlimited assortment of goods and a wealth of product and buying information. For example, on its website and mobile app, Amazon.com offers more information than most of us can digest, ranging from top 10 product lists, extensive product descriptions, and expert and user product reviews to recommendations based on customers’ previous searches and purchases.

Through direct marketing, buyers can interact with sellers by phone or on the seller’s website or mobile app to create exactly the configuration of information, products, or services they want and then order them on the spot. Finally, for consumers who want it, digital marketing through online, mobile, and social media provides a sense of brand engagement and community—a place to share brand information and experiences with other brand fans.

For sellers, direct marketing often provides a low-cost, efficient, speedy alternative for reaching their markets. Today’s direct marketers can target small groups or individual customers. Because of the one-to-one nature of direct marketing, companies can interact with  
customers by phone or online, learn more about their needs, and personalize products and services to specific customer tastes. In turn, customers can ask questions and volunteer feedback.

Direct and digital marketing also offer sellers greater flexibility. They let marketers make ongoing adjustments to prices and programs or to create immediate, timely, and personal engagement and offers. For example, home-improvement retailer Lowe’s issues timely stop-motion Vine “Fix in Six” videos showing seasonal do-it-yourself tips for anything from keeping squirrels away from a spring vegetable garden to storing Christmas lights after the holidays.

Especially in today’s digital environment, direct marketing provides opportunities for *real-time marketing* that links brands to important moments and trending events in customers’ lives. It is a powerful tool for moving customers through the buying process and for building customer engagement, community, and personalized relationships. For example, in some locations, Dunkin’ Donuts engages people who search “coffee near me” on their phones using Google Maps or Google Search with mobile ads that say, “Find the fastest coffee.” ● Clicking on the ad brings up a map and wait times at nearby Dunkin’ Donuts locations. And brands ranging from Chipotle or Starbucks to the Red Cross use Twitter to communicate with consumers in real time about important promotions, events, and other news and announcements.

# Forms of Direct and Digital Marketing

The major forms of direct and digital marketing are shown in ● **Figure 17.1**. Traditional direct marketing tools include face-to-face selling, direct-mail marketing, catalog marketing, telemarketing, direct-response television marketing, and kiosk marketing. In recent years, however, a dazzling new set of digital direct marketing tools has burst onto the marketing scene, including online marketing (websites, online ads and promotions, email, online videos, and blogs), social media marketing, and mobile marketing.

We’ll begin by examining the new direct digital and social media marketing tools that have received so much attention lately. Then we’ll look at the still heavily used and very important traditional direct marketing tools. As always, however, it’s important to remember that all of these tools—both the new digital and the more traditional forms—must be blended into a fully integrated marketing communications program.
