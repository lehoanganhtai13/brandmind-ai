# Table 13.1 | Major Store Retailer Types

This table outlines different types of retail stores, categorized by their product assortment, pricing strategy, and operational model. Specialty stores focus on a narrow product line with deep selection, exemplified by apparel or bookstore chains. Department stores offer multiple product lines, each managed separately, such as clothing and home furnishings. Supermarkets are large, self-service operations for groceries and household goods, while convenience stores are smaller, accessible locations with limited, high-turnover items. Discount stores offer standard merchandise at lower prices and higher volumes. Off-price retailers, including factory outlets, independent operations, and warehouse clubs, sell goods at reduced wholesale or retail prices. Finally, superstores are expansive, catering to total consumer needs, encompassing supercenters (combining supermarket and discount elements) and category killers with deep assortments in specific product areas.

## Supermarket

A large, low-cost, low-margin, high-volume, self-service store that carries a wide variety of grocery and household products.

Supermarkets are the most frequently visited type of retail store. Today, however, they are facing slow sales growth because of slower population growth and an increase in competition from discounters (Walmart, Costco, and Dollar General) on the one hand and specialty food stores (Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s, ALDI, Sprouts) on the other. Supermarkets’ share of U.S. packaged foods sales slipped from 53 percent in 1998 to 37 percent in 2012. Supermarkets also have been hit hard by the rapid growth of out-of-home eating over the past two decades.

In the battle for “share of stomachs,” some supermarkets are competing head-on with large discounters such as Costco and Walmart by cutting costs, establishing more-efficient operations, and lowering prices. An example is WinCo, the fast-growing regional discount-grocery chain in the western United States that positions itself directly against mighty Walmart as “The Supermarket Low Price Leader.” WinCo’s large, efficient, no-frills stores carry a limited assortment of basic fast-moving merchandise, and customers help to keep costs down by bagging their own groceries and paying cash (no credit cards accepted). As a result, WinCo doesn’t just match Walmart’s prices; it often undercuts them.

Other supermarkets have moved upscale, providing improved store environments and higher-quality food offerings, such as from-scratch bakeries, gourmet deli counters, natural foods, and fresh seafood departments. Still others are introducing their own smaller, fresh-format stores that compete with higher-end specialty grocers such as Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, or Fresh Thyme. These fresh-format stores cater to customers seeking health and wellness and the ease of shopping in smaller, warmer environments.
