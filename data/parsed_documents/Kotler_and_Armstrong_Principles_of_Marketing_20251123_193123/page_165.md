work closely with influential “mom bloggers” or “social media moms,” turning them into brand advocates (see Real Marketing 5.1).

Even Bermuda uses social media extensively. The Bermuda Tourism Authority maintains Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media pages; two mobile apps, including the Bermuda’s Very Own Mobile Events App; and a Discovering Bermuda blog featuring “Posts from Paradise.” It also hires popular users of social media such as Instagram and trendy Tastemade—which features quirky videos about restaurants—to the island and urges them to post about their visits.¹⁵

We will dig deeper into online and social media as marketing tools in Chapter 17. However, although much current talk focuses on the digital, mobile, and social media, most brand conversations still take place the old-fashioned way—face to face. So effective word-of-mouth marketing programs usually begin with generating person-to-person brand conversations and integrating both offline and online social influence strategies. The goal is to get customers involved with brands and then help them share their brand passions and experiences with others in both their real and digital worlds. Consider Red Bull:¹⁶

> Red Bull’s fizzy energy drink was launched as a true product innovation in 1987 and went on to become a massive success, with more than 6 billion cans sold worldwide in 2016. Besides the product itself, the success of Red Bull rests on the unique marketing approaches of its founder, Dietrich Mateschitz. He tied Red Bull to extreme activities, from air races to Formula One to Felix Baumgartner’s stratosphere jump in 2012, making it a synonym for adventure and energy. Social media is a significant pillar of this strategy: the brand’s Facebook and Twitter accounts, which are home to an extensive and active community, feature a vast array of pictures, videos, and stories illustrating the brand’s spirit. But Red Bull also places great value on promoting the brand on a personal level in the form of student ambassadors around the world who represent the brand on their campuses and are responsible for spreading its image by organizing events and brand-relevant initiatives.

## Family

Family members can strongly influence buyer behavior. The family is the most important consumer buying organization in society, and it has been researched extensively. Marketers are interested in the roles and influence of the husband, wife, and children on the purchase of different products and services.

Husband–wife involvement varies widely by product category and by stage in the buying process. Buying roles change with evolving consumer lifestyles. For example, in the United States, the wife traditionally has been considered the main purchasing agent for the family in the areas of food, household products, and clothing. But with 71 percent of all mothers now working outside the home and the willingness of husbands to do more of the family’s purchasing, all this has changed in recent years. Recent surveys show that 41 percent of men are now the primary grocery shoppers in their households, 39 percent handle most of their household’s laundry, and about one-quarter say they are responsible for all of their household’s cooking. At the same time, today women outspend men three to two on new technology purchases and influence more than 80 percent of all new car purchases.¹⁷

Such shifting roles signal a new marketing reality. Marketers in industries that have traditionally sold their products to only women or only men—from groceries and personal care products to cars and consumer electronics—are now carefully targeting the opposite sex. Other companies are showing their products in “modern family” contexts. For example, one General Mills ad shows a father packing Go-Gurt yogurt in his son’s lunch as the child heads off to school in the morning, with the slogan “Dads who America’s moms constitute a huge market.
