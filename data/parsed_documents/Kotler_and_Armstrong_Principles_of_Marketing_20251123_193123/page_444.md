# 14.2 Doing Good with Advertising and Marketing

Most companies today have built social responsibility into their corporate missions, and they use advertising and marketing to promote socially responsible programs, actions, and ideas. Rather than focusing only on profits, they recognize that company success is inexorably linked to the welfare of their customers and the world around them.

An all-time classic example is the long-running “Dove Campaign for Real Beauty,” which set out to change stereotypical definitions of beauty with ads featuring candid and confident images of real women with all sorts of body types (not glamorous actresses or skinny models). “Our mission is to make more women feel beautiful every day by broadening the definition of beauty,” says Dove. Over the years, the constantly evolving “Campaign for Real Beauty”—consisting of ads, heavily viewed digital videos, and other content—has done much to serve the cause of lifting women’s self-esteem. And although the campaign has noble motives beyond sales and profits, it has also contributed greatly to Dove’s success. During the first decade of the campaign, the brand’s annual revenues grew from $2.5 billion to more than $4 billion.

Companies in almost every industry now support and promote a wide range of social and environmental causes. Chipotle’s “Food with Integrity” campaign challenges factory farming and promotes organic, local, and family-farmed ingredients. Intel’s “Girl Rising” campaign promotes education for girls around the world; Google’s “Made with Code” campaign encourages young girls to pursue science and technology careers. And Apple’s “Better” campaign raises awareness of important environmental issues because “it’s our responsibility to make sure that while creating beautiful products, we’re also caring for our beautiful planet.”

Thus, more and more, companies are using advertising and marketing to take a stand on relevant social and environmental issues, not just to make a buck but because it’s the right thing to do. Let’s look more deeply into three successful campaigns promoting social responsibility.

## AT&T: “It Can Wait”

As the texting-while-driving epidemic has worsened, AT&T—one of the nation’s largest voice and data services providers—has stepped in with its “It Can Wait” campaign, which urges people to put away their phones while driving.

At the heart of the campaign is a slate of TV and digital ads that depict the horrific potential outcomes of using a phone while driving. One recent three-minute digital ad, “Close to Home,” shows different people going about their day. One is a young mother out running errands with her daughter securely seat-belted in the back seat. She looks down briefly to check a social media post on her phone, inadvertently crosses the center line, and causes a head-on collision with an oncoming car. The ad is graphic and difficult to watch, but the message is clear: Even a quick glance at your phone while driving can have disastrous consequences. “It can wait,” admonishes the ad.

Ads are just the beginning of the extensive “It Can Wait” campaign. AT&T also offers a DriveMode app that kicks in automatically while the car is rolling to silence texts and alerts and to notify senders that the user is behind the wheel. The campaign promotes the It Can Wait Pledge, by which people commit to keeping their eyes on the road and not their phones—almost 8 million people have taken the pledge so far. There’s even an It Can Wait virtual reality simulator that puts people behind the wheel to experience smartphone-induced crashes. Other efforts include celebrity tweets and outreach sessions at schools.

With the help of dozens of partnering companies and media organizations, “It Can Wait” has garnered hundreds of millions of impressions. Now in its seventh year, the campaign appears to be helping. “We do surveys [that show] we are making a difference,” says an AT&T marketer. “About a third of people say our no-texting-while-driving message has changed their behavior.”

## The Rainforest Alliance: “Follow the Frog”

Nonprofit organizations also rely heavily on advertising and promotion to market their social and environmental missions. Since 1987, the Rainforest Alliance—an international nonprofit conservation organization—has promoted the cause of minimizing harmful human impact on the environment. Companies committed to sustainable sourcing from farms and forests can earn the right to display the Rainforest Alliance Certified logo—with its signature green tree frog symbol—on their packages and promotional materials. The organization also offers sourcing assistance and training to help businesses improve their sustainability efforts.

In 2012, to boost awareness of pressing ecological challenges—such as deforestation, climate change, and water quality—the Rainforest Alliance launched an encompassing and clever promotional campaign called “Follow the Frog.” The campaign began with an award-winning three-minute web video comically illustrating what people *don’t* have to do to help the environment. The video features a young professional who goes to ecological extremes. He quits his job, leaves his wife and young child, and heads to the heart of the Amazon jungle, where he joins in a crusade against evil factions that are
