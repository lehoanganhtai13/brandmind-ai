brand), and *esteem* (how highly consumers regard and respect the brand). Brands with strong brand equity rate high on all four dimensions. The brand must be distinct, or consumers will have no reason to choose it over other brands. However, the fact that a brand is highly differentiated doesn’t necessarily mean that consumers will buy it. The brand must stand out in ways that are relevant to consumers’ needs. Even a differentiated, relevant brand is far from a shoe-in. Before consumers will respond to the brand, they must first know about and understand it. And that familiarity must lead to a strong, positive consumer-brand connection.27

Thus, positive brand equity derives from consumer feelings about and connections with a brand. A brand with high brand equity is a very valuable asset. **Brand value** is the total financial value of a brand. Measuring such value is difficult. However, according to one estimate, the brand value of Apple is a whopping $246 billion, with Google at $174 billion, Microsoft at $115 billion, IBM at $94 billion, AT&T at $92 billion, and Verizon at $86 billion. Other brands rating among the world’s most valuable include McDonald’s, Facebook, Alibaba, and Amazon.28

A powerful brand also offers the company some defense against fierce price competition and other competitor marketing actions.

Above all, however, a powerful brand forms the basis for building strong and profitable customer engagement and relationships. The fundamental asset underlying brand equity is *customer equity*—the value of customer relationships that the brand creates. A powerful brand is important, but what it really represents is a profitable set of loyal customers. The proper focus of marketing is building customer equity, with brand management serving as a major marketing tool. Companies need to think of themselves not as portfolios of brands but as portfolios of customers.

> Brands are powerful assets that must be carefully developed and managed. As this figure suggests, building strong brands involves many challenging decisions.

This table outlines four key decisions in developing a branding strategy. Brand positioning focuses on defining the brand's market offering by highlighting its attributes, benefits, and underlying beliefs and values. Brand name selection involves choosing an appropriate name and ensuring its legal protection. Brand sponsorship considers different ownership models, including manufacturer's brands, private brands, licensing agreements, and co-branding partnerships. Finally, brand development explores various growth strategies, such as line extensions, brand extensions, introducing multibrands, or creating entirely new brands.
