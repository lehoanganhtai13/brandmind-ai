# Giving It All Away

In the past five years, Facebook’s revenues have gone viral—from $2 billion to $18 billion, a ninefold increase to its top line. With a 20 percent margin, its bottom line isn’t doing too badly either. And although Facebook has experimented with various ways to generate income, the vast majority of its income comes via tried-and-true online advertising.

With all the development of fancy technologies such as drones, lasers, virtual reality, and 3D video, you might think that Facebook intends to diversify into new businesses that could generate cash and profits. But nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, as Facebook launches these and other technologies, it is giving away the designs for free. Years ago when Facebook built its own servers and data centers, it promptly open-sourced the designs and let the world have them for nothing. It did the same with big data analytics tools such as Cassandra and Hadoop. Although that might seem like throwing away money, it’s right in line with Facebook’s mission. Whereas most companies define themselves by a craft, such as making the best consumer electronic gadgets or solving companies’ efficiency problems, Facebook has been built around a single-minded goal of connecting everyone in the world and giving them the tools they need “to share anything and everything in a natural way.”

For that reason, Facebook focuses on what it does best—being the best social network. Rather than becoming distracted by developing multiple business units and trying to make money through diversified means, it remains focused on building its user base and treating its core social media products as works in process. To those who view the projects coming out of the Connectivity Lab as unrelated, Zuckerberg points out, “They’re actually incredibly focused in terms of the mission. The real goal is to build the community. A lot of times, the best way to advance the technology is to work on it as a community.”

With many companies already working on the very technologies that Facebook is trying to advance, it might seem that Facebook isn’t adding much. But Zuckerberg is impatient, and he feels that the tech world is providing too little, too late. For example, Facebook’s laser drones will be able to shower entire rural areas, villages, and cities with extremely high bandwidth at higher speeds with more economical costs than the systems currently being employed and developed by telecom companies. “We need certain technologies to exist in the world, so we will build those,” says Zuckerberg. “We’re not selling [servers] or cameras or connectivity services. But if no one else is building them, we’re going to.”

Whatever its future, Facebook seems to have barely scratched the surface when it comes to fulfilling its mission. Its new multi-app, multi-segment strategy, combined with its massive, closely knit social structure, gives Facebook staggering potential. And moving the world toward internet access for all will help make Facebook’s portfolio of apps and products available to everyone. For years, a popular saying around Facebook has been “We are one percent done with our mission.” These days, those who manage Facebook might concede that they’ve made progress—say, to maybe 2 percent. For skeptics, consider how Facebook got started:

> It was a few nights after [Zuckerberg] launched the website. He and his computer science buddy were getting pizza and talking. Zuckerberg told his friend that someone was going to build a social network, because it was too important not to exist. But he didn’t guess, back then, that he’d be the guy to do it. There were older people and bigger companies. So why, then, was Zuckerberg the one to build Facebook? “I think it’s because we cared. A lot of times, caring about something and believing in it trumps,” he says. “I couldn’t connect the dots going forward on Facebook from the beginning. To me, that’s a lot of the story of [Facebook’s future] too.”
