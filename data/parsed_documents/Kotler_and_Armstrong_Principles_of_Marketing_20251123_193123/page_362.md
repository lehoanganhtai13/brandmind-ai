# Chapter 12 | Marketing Channels: Delivering Customer Value

To the extent that the manufacturer performs these functions, its costs go up; therefore, its prices must be higher. When some of these functions are shifted to intermediaries, the producer’s costs and prices may be lower, but the intermediaries must charge more to cover the costs of their work. In dividing the work of the channel, the various functions should be assigned to the channel members that can add the most value for the cost.

## Number of Channel Levels

Companies can design their distribution channels to make products and services available to customers in different ways. Each layer of marketing intermediaries that performs some work in bringing the product and its ownership closer to the final buyer is a **channel level**. Because both the producer and the final consumer perform some work, they are part of every channel.

The *number of intermediary levels* indicates the *length* of a channel. **Figure 12.2** shows both consumer and business channels of different lengths. Figure 12.2A shows several common consumer distribution channels. Channel 1, a **direct marketing channel**, has no intermediary levels—the company sells directly to consumers. For example, Mary Kay Cosmetics and Amway sell their products through home and office sales parties and online websites and social media; companies ranging from GEICO insurance to Omaha Steaks sell directly to customers via internet, mobile, and telephone channels. The remaining channels in Figure 12.2A are **indirect marketing channels**, containing one or more intermediaries.

Figure 12.2B shows some common business distribution channels. The business marketer can use its own sales force to sell directly to business customers. Or it can sell to various types of intermediaries, which in turn sell to these customers. Although consumer and business marketing channels with even more levels can sometimes be found, these are less common. From the producer’s point of view, a greater number of levels means less control and greater channel complexity. Moreover, all the institutions in the channel are connected by several types of *flows*. These include the *physical flow* of products, the *flow of ownership*, the *payment flow*, the *information flow*, and the *promotion flow*. These flows can make even channels with only one or a few levels very complex.

### Definitions

This table outlines different levels of marketing channels, focusing on the presence or absence of intermediaries. The **Channel level** is defined as a layer of intermediaries facilitating product and ownership transfer closer to the buyer. A **Direct marketing channel** is characterized by the complete absence of any intermediaries. Conversely, an **Indirect marketing channel** is distinguished by the inclusion of one or more intermediary levels between the producer and the final buyer. This structure presents a comparative overview of channel types based on their intermediary composition.

### Figure 12.2 Consumer and Business Marketing Channels

This table outlines two primary categories of marketing channels: Consumer marketing channels and Business marketing channels. Consumer marketing channels are further divided into direct channels, where a company sells directly to consumers (e.g., GEICO, Amway), and indirect channels, which involve one or more intermediaries. Indirect consumer channels can include a producer selling to a retailer who then sells to the consumer (Channel 2), or a producer selling to a wholesaler who then sells to a retailer, who finally sells to the consumer (Channel 3). Business marketing channels primarily utilize indirect channels, involving intermediaries such as business distributors, manufacturer's representatives, or sales branches to reach business customers. These channels can involve a producer selling directly to a business distributor who then sells to a business customer (Channel 2), or a producer selling to a business distributor who then sells to another business distributor, who finally sells to the business customer (Channel 3). Channels are made up of more than just boxes and arrows on paper.
