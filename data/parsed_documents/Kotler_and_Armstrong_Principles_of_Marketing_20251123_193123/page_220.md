Green Label produces a constant flow of engaging content that gets superfans interacting with the brand. Green Label has also spawned ambitious projects such *Mountain Dew’s Green Label Experience*—a cable TV series showcasing action sports from The Dew Tour—and *We Are Blood*—a feature-length film that follows amateur and pro skaters around the world, “celebrating the unconditional bond created by the simple act of skateboarding.” The main GreenLabel.com site now draws five times more traffic than MountainDew.com.  
In all, few brands can match Mountain Dew when it comes to engaging loyal customers and involving them with the brand. In turn, the cult-like loyalty of the Dew Nation has kept Mountain Dew flowing even as competitors face declines. “The thing that really makes it different from a lot of other drinks, certainly from a lot of other carbonated soft drinks, is its incredibly loyal and passionate consumer base,” says Mountain Dew’s top marketer. To such loyal fans, Mountain Dew is more than just a something you drink. In the words of PepsiCo’s CEO, to Dew fans, Mountain Dew is “an attitude. It’s a fantastic attitude.”  
Just ask a superfan like 20-year-old Steven Kearney, who’s been drinking Mountain Dew every day since eighth grade. Kearney has a collection of 80 vintage cans and bottles—he collects a new can as a memento every time a new flavor is released. He always starts the show he hosts on his college radio station by popping open a can of Mountain Dew, and he hangs out with a group of friends he calls “The Mountain Dew buddies.” Will he ever outgrow his yen to “Do the Dew”? “I feel like it will definitely be something I’m going to drink for the rest of my life,” he says.

Using Experian’s mosaic USA segmentation system, marketers can paint a surprisingly precise picture of who you are and what you might buy. Mosaic USA segments carry colorful names such as Colleges and Cafes, Birkenstocks and Beemers, Bohemian Groove, Hispanic Harmony, Rolling the Dice, Small Town Shallow Pockets, and True Grit Americans that help bring the segments to life. zeljkodan/Shutterstock

Bohemian Groove, Sports Utility Families, Colleges and Cafes, Heritage Heights, Small Town Shallow Pockets, and True Grit Americans. Such colorful names help bring the segments to life.  

For example, the Birkenstocks and Beemers group is located in the Middle-Class Melting Pot level of affluence and consists of 40- to 65-year-olds who have achieved financial security and left the urban rat race for rustic and artsy communities located near small cities. They find spirituality more important than religion. Colleges and Cafes consumers are part of the Singles and Starters affluence level and are mainly white, under-35 college graduates who are still finding themselves. They are often employed as support or service staff related to a university. They don’t make much money and tend to not have any savings.  

Mosaic USA and other such systems can help marketers to segment people and locations into marketable groups of like-minded consumers. Each segment has its own pattern of likes, dislikes, lifestyles, and purchase behaviors. For example, Bohemian Groove consumers, part of the Significant Singles group, are urban singles ages 45 to 65 living in apartments in smaller cities such as Sacramento, CA, and Harrisburg, PA. They tend to be laid back, maintain a large circle of friends, and stay active in community groups. They enjoy music, hobbies, and the creative arts. When they go out to eat, they choose places such as the Macaroni Grill or Red Robin. Their favorite TV channels are Bravo, Lifetime, Oxygen, and TNT, and they watch two times more *CSI* than the average American. Using the Mosaic system, marketers can paint a surprisingly precise picture of who you are and what you might buy.  

Such rich segmentation provides a powerful tool for marketers of all kinds. It can help companies identify and better understand key customer segments, reach them more efficiently, and tailor market offerings and messages to their specific needs.

## Segmenting Business Markets

Consumer and business marketers use many of the same variables to segment their markets. Business buyers can be segmented geographically, demographically (industry, company size), or by benefits sought, user status, usage rate, and loyalty status. Yet business marketers also use some additional variables, such as customer *operating characteristics*, *purchasing approaches*, *situational factors*, and *personal characteristics*.
