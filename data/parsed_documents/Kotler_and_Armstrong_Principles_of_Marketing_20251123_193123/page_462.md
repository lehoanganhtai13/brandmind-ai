# Message Execution

The creative team must find the best approach, style, tone, words, and format for executing the message. The message can be presented in various **execution styles**, such as the following:

* **Slice of life.** This style shows one or more “typical” people using the product in a normal setting. For example, IKEA content—from microsites and Instagram posts to print ads and television commercials—features people living in rooms furnished with IKEA furniture and household goods.

* **Lifestyle.** This style shows how a product fits in with a particular lifestyle. For example, an ad for Athleta activewear shows a woman in a complex yoga pose and states: “If your body is your temple, build it one piece at a time.”

* **Fantasy.** This style creates a fantasy around the product or its use. For example, a Calvin Klein “Drive in to Fantasy” ad shows a woman floating blissfully above a surf-strewn beach at sunset in her Calvin Klein Nightwear.

* **Mood or image.** This style builds a mood or image around the product or service, such as beauty, love, intrigue, serenity, or pride. Few claims are made about the product or service except through suggestion. For example, a tear-inducing Budweiser “Lost Dog” commercial portrayed a little lost puppy that was rescued from a hungry wolf by his pals the Budweiser Clydesdales. The ad tugged effectively at heartstrings and topped the ad charts during Super Bowl XLIX while saying nothing about the taste or other qualities of Budweiser beer.

* **Musical.** This style shows people or cartoon characters singing about the product. For example, the M&M’s “Love Ballad” ad, part of the Better with M campaign, featured Red singing Meat Loaf’s “I’d Do Anything for Love,” showcasing his commitment to actress Naya Rivera. Red has second thoughts, however, when Rivera can’t resist adding Red to some of her favorite treats, including cookies, cake, and ice cream. To all of that, Red answers with the lyric, “But I won’t do that . . . or that . . . or that . . . or that.”

  * **Personality symbol.** This style creates a character that represents the product. The character might be animated (Mr. Clean, the GEICO Gecko, or the Pillsbury Doughboy) or real (perky Progressive Insurance spokeswoman Flo, Dos Equis beer’s “The Most Interesting Man in the World,” or Ronald McDonald).

  * **Technical expertise.** This style shows the company’s expertise in making the product. Thus, Jim Koch of the Boston Beer Company tells about his many years of experience in brewing Samuel Adams beer.

  * **Scientific evidence.** This style presents survey or scientific evidence that the brand is better or better liked than one or more other brands. For years, Crest toothpaste has used scientific evidence to convince buyers that Crest is better than other brands at fighting cavities.

  * **Testimonial evidence or endorsement.** This style features a highly believable or likable source endorsing the product. It could be ordinary people saying how much they like a given product. For example, Whole Foods features a variety of real customers in its Values Matter marketing campaign. Or it might be a celebrity presenting the product, such as Taylor Swift for Diet Coke or NBA star Stephen Curry for Under Armour.

The advertiser also must choose a **tone** for the ad. For example, P&G always uses a positive tone: Its ads say something very positive about its products. Other advertisers now use edgy humor to break through the commercial clutter. Doritos commercials are famous for this.

The advertiser must use memorable and attention-getting **words** in the ad. For example, rather than just saying that its prescription sunglass lenses protect your eyes and look good at the same time, a LensCrafters ad announces, “Sunblock Never Looked So Good.” Rather than claiming that “a BMW is a well-engineered automobile,” BMW uses more creative and higher-impact phrasing: “The ultimate”

Novel formats can make an advertisement stand out: In this Sherwin-Williams ad, the eye-catching illustration delivers the bulk of the “Where will color take you?” message.  
The Sherwin-Williams Company driving machine.” And instead of stating plainly that Hanes socks last longer than less expensive ones, Hanes suggests, “Buy cheap socks and you’ll pay through the toes.”
