To “give a clock” in Chinese sounds the same as “seeing someone off to his end.”

Thus, to compete successfully in global markets, or even to deal effectively with international firms in their home markets, companies must help their managers to understand the needs, customs, and cultures of international business buyers. Several companies now offer smartphone apps that provide tips to international travelers and help prevent them from making embarrassing mistakes while abroad. Cultures around the world differ greatly, and marketers must dig deeply to make certain they adapt to these differences. “When doing business in a foreign country and a foreign culture . . . take nothing for granted,” advises an international business specialist. “Turn every stone. Ask every question. Dig into every detail.”

Participants may influence the buying decision because they control rewards and punishments, are well liked, have special expertise, or have a special relationship with other important participants. Interpersonal factors are often very subtle. Whenever possible, business marketers must try to understand these factors and design strategies that take them into account.

Each participant in the business buying decision process brings in personal motives, perceptions, and preferences. These *individual factors* are affected by personal characteristics such as age, income, education, professional identification, personality, and attitudes toward risk. Also, buyers have different buying styles. Some may be technical types who make in-depth analyses of competitive proposals before choosing a supplier. Other buyers may be intuitive negotiators who are adept at pitting the sellers against one another for the best deal.

# The Business Buyer Decision Process

**Figure 6.3** lists the eight stages of the business buyer decision process. Buyers who face a new task buying situation usually go through all stages of the buying process. Buyers making modified or straight rebuys, in contrast, may skip some of the stages. We will examine these steps for the typical new task buying situation.

## Problem Recognition

The buying process begins when someone in the company recognizes a problem or need that can be met by acquiring a specific product or service. **Problem recognition** can result from internal or external stimuli. Internally, the company may decide to launch a new product that requires new production equipment and materials. Or a machine may break down and need new parts. Perhaps a purchasing manager is unhappy with a current supplier’s product quality, service, or prices. Externally, the buyer may get some new ideas at a trade show, see an ad or website, or receive a call from a salesperson who offers a better product or a lower price.

The Business Buyer Decision Process, as depicted in Figure 6.3, outlines a sequential flow of eight stages typically encountered by buyers in complex purchasing situations. This process begins with Problem Recognition, leading to a General Need Description, and then a detailed Product Specification. Subsequently, buyers engage in Supplier Search, followed by Proposal Solicitation from potential vendors. The core of the process involves Supplier Selection, after which an Order-Routine Specification is established. The cycle concludes with a Performance Review of the chosen supplier and product. While this diagram presents a linear progression, it's noted that buyers making rebuys may bypass certain stages, and the actual process is often more intricate than this simplified model suggests. In fact, business marketers often alert customers to potential problems and then show how their products and services provide solutions.
