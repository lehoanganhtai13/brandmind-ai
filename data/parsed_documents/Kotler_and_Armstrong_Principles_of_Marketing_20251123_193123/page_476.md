There are also a large number of “micro” markets that are handled by PR specialists. These agencies have specialized knowledge of a sector, product type, country or sector. They are the “go-to” agency in specialized situations; it also seems that the bigger agencies have them on sub-contract when necessary. Apart from London, Manchester has the largest number of agencies with the greatest income. There are another 17 cities in the United Kingdom that have at least one dedicated PR agency with a range of clients. In the regional markets and the less densely populated areas of the United Kingdom, there is greater fragmentation and a larger number of freelance PR specialists. These freelancers often work as a fairly small group and are not classified as agencies.

## Marketing by the Numbers  Dubai City Guide

Cyber Gear’s Dubai City Guide has been active online since 1996. It has become a vital source of news and information for Dubai residents and visitors. With a wide range of stories covering news, city events, promotions, sales, art events, movie timings, and other features, it is constantly being updated. The website is well organized and attractive, and it reflects the vibrant nature of Dubai itself. Many tourists visit the site before coming to Dubai, and the guide has in excess of 80,000 subscribers and attracts over a million visitors per month. The site is largely funded by advertisers, and Cyber Gear has created a system by which advertisers can choose pages that best fit their target audiences. The site is very open about its visitor statistics, which is understandable given the fact that it faces a huge amount of competition from other advertising outlets and opportunities. The following statistics on the web traffic for the site as of October 2010 are available at www.dubaicityguide.com. A common measure of advertising efficiency is cost per thousand impressions (CPM). The following table outlines the typical CPM rates for advertising on the website:

This data presents a comparative analysis of different banner ad types and their associated costs, specifically measured in Cost Per Mille (CPM), which represents the cost per thousand impressions. The structure is a simple categorization of banner types against their pricing. The types of banners include Standard banner, Leaderboard banner, Skyscraper banner, and Space banner. Each of these banner types has a distinct CPM cost: Standard banners are priced at $25 CPM, Leaderboard banners at $40 CPM, Skyscraper banners at $35 CPM, and Space banners at the highest cost of $50 CPM. This indicates a direct relationship between the banner type and its associated advertising expense, with Space banners being the most expensive and Standard banners the least expensive among those listed.

## Video Case  Kmart

On the heels of its wildly popular “Ship My Pants” ads, Kmart struck again with an ad that was considered hilarious by some, offensive by others, and a stroke of genius by advertising critics. Its latest ad, “Big Gas Savings,” was launched on YouTube prior to airing on television. And like its “Ship My Pants” predecessor, the ad also went viral.  
In addition to relying on potty humor to pull its sales out of the toilet, Kmart struck a very timely note in the tune of customer value—saving money on gasoline. Customers could save 30 cents a gallon on gas by spending $50 or more in its stores. Millions of customers took advantage of the offer, driving traffic into Kmart stores.  
After viewing the video featuring Kmart, answer the following questions:  
**15-15** What is the advertising message in the Kmart “Big Gas Savings” ad?  
**15-16** Why did Kmart choose to air this video on YouTube?  
**15-17** Is this Kmart ad effective? Explain.

## Company Case  Allstate: Bringing Mayhem to the Auto Insurance Advertising Wars

In the spring of 1950, the teenage daughter of Allstate general sales manager Davis Ellis was stricken with hepatitis shortly before she was to graduate from high school. The worried executive arrived home from work one evening just as his wife returned from the hospital where their daughter was admitted. As he met her at the front door, his wife reported, “The hospital said not to worry. . .we’re in good hands with the doctor.”  
Later that year, Ellis became part of a team charged with developing the first major national advertising campaign for the Allstate Insurance Company. As the team discussed the message they wanted the brand to convey, Ellis recalled his wife’s “we’re in good hands” remark and how good it made him feel. The phrase projected security, reassurance, and responsibility, exactly the traits the team wanted customers to associate with Allstate. Thus was born the slogan, “You’re in Good Hands with Allstate.”  
By the early 2000s, a study by Northwestern University found that the long-standing Allstate catchphrase was the most recognized slogan in the United States. For years, Allstate held the position as the second-largest personal lines insurer, trailing only State Farm. Shortly thereafter, Allstate hired actor Dennis Haysbert as the brand’s spokesperson.
