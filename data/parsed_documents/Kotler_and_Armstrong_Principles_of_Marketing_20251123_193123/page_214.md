# Market Segmentation

Buyers in any market differ in their wants, resources, locations, buying attitudes, and buying practices. Through market segmentation, companies divide large, diverse markets into smaller segments that can be reached more efficiently and effectively with products and services that match their unique needs. In this section, we discuss four important segmentation topics: segmenting consumer markets, segmenting business markets, segmenting international markets, and the requirements for effective segmentation.

## Segmenting Consumer Markets

There is no single way to segment a market. A marketer has to try different segmentation variables, alone and in combination, to find the best way to view market structure.  
**Table 7.1** outlines variables that might be used in segmenting consumer markets. Here we look at the major *geographic*, *demographic*, *psychographic*, and *behavioral* variables.

### Geographic Segmentation

**Geographic segmentation** calls for dividing the market into different geographical units, such as nations, regions, states, counties, cities, or even neighborhoods. A company may decide to operate in one or a few geographical areas or operate in all areas but pay attention to geographical differences in needs and wants. Moreover, many companies today are localizing their products, services, advertising, promotion, and sales efforts to fit the needs of individual regions, cities, and other localities.

For example, many large retailers—from Target and Walmart to Kohl’s and Staples—are now opening smaller-format stores designed to fit the needs of densely packed urban neighborhoods not suited to their typical large suburban superstores. Target’s CityTarget stores average about half the size of a typical Super Target; its TargetExpress stores are even smaller at about one-fifth the size of a big-box outlet. These smaller, conveniently located stores carry a more limited assortment of goods that meet the needs of urban residents and commuters, such as groceries, home essentials, beauty products, and consumer electronics. They also offer pick-up-in-store services and a pharmacy.

Beyond adjusting store size, many retailers also localize product assortments and services. For example, department store chain Macy’s has a localization program called MyMacy’s in which merchandise is customized under 69 different geographical districts. At stores around the country, Macy’s sales clerks record local shopper requests and pass them along to district managers. In turn, blending the customer requests with store

This table outlines the four primary bases for market segmentation: Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, and Behavioral. Geographic segmentation divides markets based on location, such as nations, regions, or population density. Demographic segmentation categorizes consumers by observable characteristics like age, income, gender, and education. Psychographic segmentation focuses on internal consumer traits, including lifestyle and personality. Finally, Behavioral segmentation groups consumers based on their interactions with a product or service, considering factors such as purchase occasions, benefits sought, user status, usage rate, and loyalty. These variables collectively provide a framework for understanding and targeting diverse consumer groups. transaction data, the district managers customize the mix of merchandise in their stores.
