# Personal Selling and Sales Promotion

It must also teach them how to sell effectively and train them in the basics of the selling process. Salespeople also need to know and identify with the company, its products, and its competitors. Therefore, an effective training program teaches them about the company’s objectives, organization, products, and the strategies of major competitors.

Today, many companies are adding digital e-learning components to their sales training programs. Online training may range from simple self-paced text- and video-based product training and internet-based sales exercises that build sales skills to sophisticated simulations that re-create the dynamics of real-life sales calls. One of the most basic forms is virtual instructor-led training (VILT). Using this method, a small group of salespeople at remote locations logs on to an online conferencing site, where a sales instructor leads training sessions using online video, audio, and interactive learning tools. [13]

Training online instead of on-site can cut travel and other training costs, and it takes up less of a salesperson’s selling time. It also makes on-demand training available to salespeople, letting them train as little or as much as needed, whenever and wherever needed. Although most e-learning is web-based, companies can offer on-demand training from anywhere via almost any mobile device.

Many companies are now using imaginative new e-learning techniques to make sales training more efficient and effective—and sometimes even more fun. For example, learning solutions company Bottom-Line Performance has developed a digital game-based sales-training tool called Knowledge Guru, which helps salespeople learn and remember key product, company, and customer facts as well as selling skills and processes.

E-training can make sales training more effective—and more engaging. BLP’s game-based sales-training tool—called Knowledge Guru—helps sales people learn key product, company, and customer facts as well as selling skills and processes. Bottom-Line Performance

Using Knowledge Guru, companies can create single-pass games that teach foundational knowledge to new salespeople or for new products or extended-play games with performance challenges for teaching new selling skills. ● Salespeople can play the learning games alone or in competition with others, offline or online on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop. All the while, sales trainers can track individual salesperson learning performance. Several Fortune 500 companies use Knowledge Guru to add fun and engagement to training tasks that can sometimes be dull or intimidating. For example, IT networking company Cisco Systems uses Knowledge Guru as part of each module within its certified sales associate program. According to a Cisco program manager who helped introduce Knowledge Guru into the program, “Before they can work with customers, new [sales] associates must obtain a deep knowledge of our architectures and technologies. Knowledge Guru is essential to reinforcing this technical knowledge, and participants have rated Knowledge Guru highly as a learning tool.” Most important, the game really works, helping salespeople achieve an average retention rate of 87 percent against training objectives across all Cisco users.

# Compensating Salespeople

To attract good salespeople, a company must have an appealing compensation plan. Compensation consists of four elements: a fixed amount, a variable amount, expenses, and fringe benefits. The fixed amount, usually a salary, gives the salesperson some stable income. The variable amount, which might be commissions or bonuses based on sales performance, rewards the salesperson for greater effort and success.

● A sales force compensation plan can both motivate salespeople and direct their activities. Compensation should direct salespeople toward activities that are consistent with the overall sales force and marketing objectives. [15] For example, if the strategy is to acquire new business, grow rapidly, and gain market share, the compensation plan might include a larger commission component, coupled with a new account bonus to encourage high sales performance and new account development. In contrast, if the goal is to maximize current account profitability, the compensation plan might contain a larger base-salary component with additional incentives for current account sales or customer satisfaction.

In fact, more and more companies are moving away from high-commission plans that may drive salespeople to make short-term grabs for business. They worry that a *Sales force compensation: A good compensation plan both motivates salespeople and directs their activities.*
