# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

## Event marketing (or event sponsorships)  
Creating a brand-marketing event or serving as a sole or participating sponsor of events created by others.

Finally, marketers can promote their brands through **event marketing (or event sponsorships)**. They can create their own brand-marketing events or serve as sole or participating sponsors of events created by others. The events might include anything from mobile brand tours to festivals, reunions, marathons, concerts, or other sponsored gatherings. Event marketing is huge, and it may be the fastest-growing area of promotion. Effective event marketing links events and sponsorships to a brand’s value proposition. And with the social sharing power of today’s digital media, even local events can have far-reaching impact. For example, Delta Faucet used an imaginative event to promote its H2Okinetic low-flow showerheads—which use 40 percent less water but work just as well as competing higher-flow models—to its fitness and family-oriented target audience.  

> Delta’s #HappiMess promotion campaign is based on the insight that some of its customers’ happiest moments came from making and overcoming big messes. To show target consumers first-hand how well its low-flow showerheads work under really tough conditions, Delta partnered with Warrior Dash, which sponsored several 5K mud run races around the country over the summer.

> At one event in Indiana, 331 people gathered to shower, setting a Guinness World Record for most people showering simultaneously. After experiencing the showerheads, 75 percent of runners surveyed said they’d consider buying one. The shower stations also included a selfie station. As a result, the event boosted social media activity around Delta’s #HappiMess campaign by 85 percent and gave the brand a 50 percent sales lift.

All kinds of brands now hold events. But one-time events are rarely as effective as well-planned event campaigns that tie into a brand’s broader promotions and positioning. Event sponsorships are becoming increasingly popular as they allow consumers to experience the brand in different ways. For example, Toyota uses its music festivals for event marketing and as a sales promotion and personal selling tool (see Real Marketing 16.2).

## Trade Promotions  
Sales promotion tools used to persuade resellers to carry a brand, give it shelf space, and promote it in advertising.

Manufacturers direct more sales promotion dollars toward retailers and wholesalers (79 percent of all promotions dollars) than to final consumers (21 percent). **Trade promotions** can persuade resellers to carry a brand, give it shelf space, promote it in advertising, and push it to consumers. Shelf space is so scarce these days that manufacturers often have to offer price-offs, allowances, buy-back guarantees, or free goods to retailers and wholesalers to get products on the shelf and, once there, to keep them on it.

Manufacturers use several trade promotion tools. Many of the tools used for consumer promotions—contests, premiums, displays—can also be used as trade promotions. Or the manufacturer may offer a straight *discount* off the list price on each case purchased during a stated period of time (also called a *price-off, off-invoice,* or *off-list*). Manufacturers also may offer an *allowance* (usually so much off per case) in return for the retailer’s agreement to feature the manufacturer’s products in some way. For example, an advertising allowance compensates retailers for advertising the product, whereas a display allowance compensates them for using special displays.

Manufacturers may offer *free goods*, which are extra cases of merchandise, to resellers who buy a certain quantity or who feature a certain flavor or size. They may also offer *push money*—cash or gifts to dealers or their sales forces to “push” the manufacturer’s goods. Manufacturers may give retailers free *specialty advertising items* that carry the company’s name, such as pens, calendars, memo pads, flashlights, and tote bags.
