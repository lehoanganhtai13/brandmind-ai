Considerably smaller than the boomer generation that precedes them and the millennials who follow, the Generation Xers are a sometimes-overlooked consumer group. Although they seek success, they are less materialistic than the other groups; they prize experience, not acquisition. For many of the Gen Xers who are parents, family comes first—both children and their aging parents—and career second.

From a marketing standpoint, the Gen Xers are a more skeptical bunch. They are sensible shoppers who research products heavily before they consider a purchase, prefer quality to quantity, and tend to be less receptive to overt marketing pitches. They are more receptive to irreverent ad pitches that make fun of convention and tradition. The first to grow up in the internet era, Generation X is a connected generation that embraces the benefits of new technology.

The Gen Xers, now in their 40s, have grown up and are taking over. They have increasingly displaced the lifestyles, culture, and values of the baby boomers. They are firmly into their careers, and many are proud homeowners with growing families. They are the most educated generation to date, and they possess hefty annual purchasing power. Although  
Gen Xers make up less than a quarter of all U.S. adults,  
they pull in 29 percent of the nation’s total income.  
With so much potential, many brands and organizations focus on Gen Xers as a prime target segment. For example, a full 82 percent of Gen Xers own their own homes, making them an important segment for home-and-hearth marketers. blue circle Home-improvement retailer Lowe’s markets heavily to Gen X homeowners, urging them to “Never Stop Improving.” Through ads, online videos, and a substantial social media presence, Lowe’s provides ideas and advice on a wide range of indoor and outdoor home-improvement projects and problems, providing solutions that make life simpler for busy Gen X homeowners and their families. Its myLowe’s app is like a 24/7 home-improvement concierge that lets customers build room-by-room profiles of their homes, archive their Lowe’s purchases, build product lists with photos, receive reminders for things like changing furnace filters, and even consult with store employees online as they plan out home-improvement projects.¹²

### Millennials  
*(or Generation Y)*  
The 83 million children of the baby boomers born between 1977 and 2000.

Both the baby boomers and Gen Xers will one day be passing the reins to the **millennials** (also called **Generation Y** or the echo boomers). Born between 1977 and 2000, these children of the baby boomers number 83 million or more, dwarfing the Gen Xers and becoming larger even than the baby boomer segment. In the post-recession era, the millennials are the most financially strapped generation. Facing higher unemployment and saddled with more debt, many of these young consumers have near-empty piggy banks. Still, because of their numbers, the millennials make up a huge and attractive market, both now and in the future.

One thing that all millennials have in common is their comfort with digital technology. They don’t just embrace technology; it’s a way of life. The millennials were the first generation to grow up in a world filled with computers, mobile phones, satellite TV, iPods and iPads, and online social media. As a result, they engage with brands in an entirely new way, such as with mobile or social media.

Compared with other generational groups, millennials tend to be frugal, practical, connected, mobile, and impatient. More than sales pitches from marketers, millennials seek authenticity and opportunities to shape their own brand experiences and share them with others. One AT&T marketer identifies what she calls “universal Millennial truths: being transparent, authentic, immediate, and versatile.”¹³

Many brands are now fielding specific products and marketing campaigns aimed at millennial needs and lifestyles. blue circle For example, many financial services firms are shedding their once-stodgy images to make their brands more appealing to millennial consumers. Consider Fifth Third Bank:¹⁴

> Fifth Third Bank knows that waiting is hard for time-crunched millennials. So it launched a new campaign called “No Waiting” that shows how its mobile app takes the wait out of banking. The People born after 2000 (although many analysts include people born after 1995) who make up the kids, tweens, and teens markets.
