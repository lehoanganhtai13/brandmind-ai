# 5.1 Tapping Social Media Moms as Brand Ambassadors

Women account for 85 percent of all consumer purchases, and the nation’s 85 million moms account $3.2 trillion worth of annual consumer spending. Moms are also heavy social media sharers and shoppers. They are 20 percent more likely than the general population to use social media, and 44 percent of moms have made a purchase on their smartphones within the past week.

Moreover, many moms rely heavily on social media to share experiences with other moms, including brand and buying experiences. For example, there are as many as 14.2 million U.S. mothers who blog, and some mom bloggers influence millions of followers. Some 55 percent of moms on social media regularly base their buying decisions on personal stories, recommendations, and product reviews that they find in blogs and other social media.

Given these pretty amazing figures, it’s not surprising that many marketers now harness the power of mom-to-mom influence by creating or tapping into networks of influential social media moms and turning them into brand ambassadors. Here are just three examples: McDonald’s, Walmart, and Disney.

## McDonald’s Mom Bloggers

McDonald’s systematically reaches out to key “mom bloggers,” those who influence the nation’s homemakers, who in turn influence their families’ eating-out choices. For example, McDonald’s recently hosted 15 influential mom bloggers on an all-expenses-paid tour of its Chicago-area headquarters. The bloggers toured the facilities (including the company’s test kitchens), met McDonald’s USA president, and had their pictures taken with Ronald at a nearby Ronald McDonald House.

McDonald’s knows that these mom bloggers have loyal followings and talk a lot about McDonald’s in their blogs. So it’s turning the bloggers into believers by giving them a behind-the-scenes view. McDonald’s doesn’t try to tell the bloggers what to say in their posts about the visit. It simply asks them to write one honest recap of their trip. However, the resulting posts (each acknowledging the blogger’s connection with McDonald’s) were mostly very positive. Thanks to this and other such efforts, mom bloggers around the country are now more informed about and connected with McDonald’s. “I know they have smoothies and they have yogurt and they have other things that my kids would want,” says one prominent blogger. “I really couldn’t tell you what Burger King’s doing right now,” she adds. “I have no idea.”

## Walmart Moms

Eight years ago, Walmart enlisted a group of 11 influential mom bloggers—originally called the ElevenMoms—to “represent the voice of all moms.” Now numbering 22 and called simply the “Walmart Moms,” these influential social media moms provide input to Walmart on behalf of all moms and in turn represent Walmart to their large blog followings.

Described by Walmart as “moms like you,” the Walmart Moms represent a cross-section of American moms in terms of geography, ethnicity, and age. “Walmart Moms are pretty much like most moms out there,” says Walmart. They “know what it’s like to balance family, work, errands, searching for missing softball mitts, and everything else in between. And [they’re] always looking for ways to save money and live better.”

The Walmart Moms have become important and influential Walmart brand ambassadors. Though surveys, focus groups, and in-store events, the mom bloggers and their readers provide Walmart and its suppliers with key customer insights regarding its stores and products. Going the other way, the Walmart Moms create relevant written and video content—everything from money-saving tips to product reviews to craft suggestions and recipes—shared on their blogs and through links on Walmart’s online and social media sites.

Walmart Moms receive product samples and compensation. Their posts often refer to products sold by Walmart and include links to the products on Walmart sites. But both Walmart and the Walmart Moms know that their strength lies in their authenticity and in the trust they build with their readers. So with Walmart’s urging and full support, the moms write whatever they please and share their sincere opinions. “Walmart does not require anything of us but to be ourselves and remain authentic to our own voice,” says one mom blogger. Without that, what the Walmart Moms write and say would be viewed as little more than paid promotions.

## Disney Social Media Moms

The Walt Disney Company has long recognized the power of moms in social media and the importance moms play in planning family vacations. Five years ago, the company assembled a group called Disney Social Media Moms, roughly 1,300 carefully selected mom

Harnessing the power of mom-to-mom influence: Each year, Disney invites 175 to 200 moms and their families to its Disney Social Media Moms Celebration in Florida, an affair that’s a mix of public relations event, educational conference, and family vacation with plenty of Disney magic for these important mom influencers. Mindy Marzec bloggers (and some dads), travel bloggers, and active Disney-focused social media posters.
