# Marketing Ethics  Exaggeration and High Pressure

Sometimes, the claims are overstated. Businesses want to make bold claims to help them sell more products. Some of the claims are morally wrong, other times they are just “advertising puff.” A business might resort to high-pressurized sales techniques. In other cases they might focus on vulnerable customer groups. Businesses need to make a profit, but is it wrong to try any means to achieve this? Legally, yes it is.

# Marketing by the Numbers  Be on the First Page

The internet has become a vital marketing medium, and pay-per-click (PPC) is one of the many ways for a business to attract traffic. It is risky, and a business can spend a lot of money, get a lot of visits, but end up with very few actual sales. Search engines allow businesses to buy listings in their search results; they appear next to the non paid organic search results. These spots are sold by auction. If the business bids the most, they get a chance, but only the chance to be ranked first.

# Video Case  Eskimo Joe’s

Since 1975, Eskimo Joe’s has been a popular watering hole in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Through word of mouth and a popular logo spread via T-shirts, it rapidly became a favorite place to grab a beer for students at Oklahoma State. But what started as a basic beer joint has grown into something much more.

When the drinking age changed from 18 to 21 in the 1980s, Eskimo Joe’s had to decide how it would move forward. That challenge helped the company to recognize that its product is much more than just a cold mug of beer. Instead, people flocked to Eskimo Joe’s for the fun atmosphere and customer-friendly service. This realization led to an expansion into different businesses that have now spread the Eskimo Joe’s logo all over the planet.
