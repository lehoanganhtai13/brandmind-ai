The system Bose developed was based on electromagnetic motors installed at each wheel. Based on inputs from road sensing monitors, the motor could retract and extend almost instantaneously. For a bump in the road, the suspension reacted by “jumping” over it. For a pothole, the suspension allowed the wheel to extend downward, retracting it quickly enough that the pothole wouldn’t be felt by passengers. In addition to these comfort-producing capabilities, the wheel motors were designed to keep a car completely level during an aggressive maneuver such as cornering or stopping. The system achieved Amar Bose’s vision to provide better handling than any sports car while simultaneously giving vehicle occupants the most comfortable ride imaginable.

Bose invested more than $100 million over 30 years in the groundbreaking suspension. In the end, the system was simply too heavy and too expensive for use in passenger cars. Rather than shelf the product, however, Bose did what it has often done — it found a market where the technology could be used to provide genuine customer value. The company now markets a smaller, lighter version of the Bose suspension as the Bose Ride seat system for heavy-duty trucks. Surpassing current air ride and other conventional technologies in performance, its $6,000 price tag also exceeded the going price of a truck seat by five to ten times. Although most companies and drivers were skeptical at first, one Texas driver’s reaction drives home the value of this product, even at the substantial price premium: “I had back pains. I used to feel every bump in my back and neck. The truck still bounces down the road, but I don’t. It’s almost like floating, detached from the truck.”

Bose’s commitment to research and development has produced state-of-the-art products that have contributed to the trust that Bose customers have in the company. Customers know that the company cares more about their interests — about making the best products — than about maximizing profits. But for a company not driven by the bottom line, Bose does just fine in that department as well. In the personal headphone market, Bose is second only to Beats (Apple) with 11 percent of the market. And with wireless speakers now dominating speaker sales, Bose leads with a decisive 22 percent share, a full six points ahead of number-two Sonos.

Amar Bose passed away a few years ago at the age of 83. With the passion of a genuine scientist, he worked every day well into his 80s. “He’s got more energy than an 18-year-old,” Maresca once said. “Every one of the naysayers only strengthens his resolve.” This work ethic illustrates the passion of the man who shaped one of today’s most innovative and most trusted companies. His philosophies have produced Bose’s long list of groundbreaking innovations. Even today, the company continues to achieve success by following another one of Amar Bose’s basic philosophies: “The potential size of the market? We really have no idea. We just know that we have a technology that’s so different and so much better that many people will want it.”
