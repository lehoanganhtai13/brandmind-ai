Under *oligopolistic competition*, the market consists of only a few large sellers. ● For example, only a handful of providers—Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, and Dish Network—control a lion’s share of the cable/satellite television market. Because there are few sellers, each seller is alert and responsive to competitors’ pricing strategies and marketing moves. In the battle for subscribers, price becomes a major competitive tool. For example, to woo customers away from Comcast, TimeWarner, and other cable companies, AT&T’s DirecTV unit offers low-price “Cable Crusher” offers, lock-in prices, and free HD.

In a *pure monopoly*, the market is dominated by one seller. The seller may be a government monopoly (the U.S. Postal Service), a private regulated monopoly (a power company), or a private unregulated monopoly (De Beers and diamonds). Pricing is handled differently in each case.

## Analyzing the Price–Demand Relationship

Each price the company might charge will lead to a different level of demand. The relationship between the price charged and the resulting demand level is shown in the **demand curve** in ● **Figure 10.6**. The demand curve shows the number of units the market will buy in a given time period at different prices that might be charged. In the normal case, demand and price are inversely related—that is, the higher the price, the lower the demand. Thus, the company would sell less if it raised its price from \(P_1\) to \(P_2\). In short, consumers with limited budgets probably will buy less of something if its price is too high.

Understanding a brand’s price-demand curve is crucial to good pricing decisions. ConAgra Foods has learned this lesson when pricing its Banquet frozen dinners:

> Banquet has charged about $1 per dinner since its start way back in 1953. And that’s what customers still expect. The $1 price is a key component in the brand’s appeal. Six years ago, when ConAgra tried to cover higher commodity costs by raising the list price of Banquet dinners from $1 to $1.25, consumers turned up their noses to the higher price. Sales dropped sharply, forcing ConAgra to sell off excess dinners at discount prices and drop its prices back to a buck a dinner. To make money at that price, ConAgra tried to do a better job of managing costs by shrinking portions and substituting less expensive ingredients for costlier ones. But as commodity prices continue to rise, Banquet just can’t make a decent dinner for a dollar anymore. So it’s cautiously raising prices again. Some smaller meals are still priced at $1. For example, the chicken finger meal still comes with macaroni and cheese but no longer includes a brownie. But classic meals such as Salisbury steak are now back up to $1.25, and ConAgra has introduced Banquet Select Recipes meals at a startling $1.50. The brand has seen some initial sales declines since the price increase but not as severe as feared. Banquet is an entry-point brand, notes ConAgra’s CEO, but “that doesn’t mean it’s married to a dollar. It [just] needs to be the best value for our core customer.”

Most companies try to measure their demand curves by estimating demand at different prices. The type of market makes a difference. In a monopoly, the demand curve shows the total market demand resulting from different prices. If the company faces competition, its demand at different prices will depend on whether competitors’ prices stay constant or change with the company’s own prices.

### Price Elasticity of Demand

Marketers also need to know **price elasticity**—how responsive demand will be to a change in price. If demand hardly changes with a small change in price, we say demand is *inelastic*. If demand changes greatly, we say the demand is *elastic*.

### Figure 10.6 Demand Curve

This table presents a comparative analysis of two distinct price points and their corresponding quantities demanded. It illustrates a fundamental economic principle where different prices, denoted as \(P_1\) and \(P_2\), are associated with varying levels of demand, represented by quantities \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) respectively. The structure suggests a direct relationship between price and quantity demanded, implying that as price changes, so does the quantity consumers are willing to purchase within a given period. This data likely serves to demonstrate the concept of the demand curve, where typically a higher price corresponds to a lower quantity demanded, and vice versa. The table's layout facilitates a straightforward comparison of these two scenarios.

> *Demand curve:* A curve that shows the number of units the market will buy in a given time period, at different prices that might be charged.

> *Price elasticity:* A measure of the sensitivity of demand to changes in price.
