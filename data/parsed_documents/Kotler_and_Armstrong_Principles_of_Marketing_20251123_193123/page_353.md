## Marketing Ethics  
### Less Bang for Your Buck

Over the past several years, careful shoppers may be spending about the same amount of money at the grocery store but leaving the store with a lighter load in their grocery bags. Food prices on many items have increased, and food manufacturers are facing the same challenges as consumers. With increases in raw materials and transportation, making a profit requires a very sharp pencil. According to Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru.com, “The reality is, if you look at USDA projections, food is going to get more expensive. And as a result, food companies are going to do one of two or three things: Raise prices and keep packages the same, or reduce the quantity in the package. Or do a little of both.”

- **11-11** Week after week, consumers shop for many of the same groceries. At some point, the product may be priced the same and look the same as before but with less in the package. If consumers are not made aware of the change, is this deception? Is this different from deceptive pricing? Explain. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)

- **11-12** Develop a list of the products you buy from a grocery store, dollar store, or convenience store where one of two things has occurred: The price has increased or the quantity in the package has decreased. Were you aware of the changes? Explain. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

## Marketing by the Numbers  
### Louis Vuitton Price Increase

One way to maintain exclusivity for a brand is to raise its price. That’s what luxury fashion and leather goods maker of Louis Vuitton did. The company does not want the brand to become overexposed and too common, so it raised prices 10 percent and is slowing its expansion in China. The Louis Vuitton brand is the largest contributor to the company’s $13.3 billion revenue from its fashion and leather division, accounting for $8 billion of those sales. It might seem counterintuitive to want to encourage fewer customers to purchase a company’s products, but when price increases, so do the product’s contribution margins, making each sale more profitable. Thus, sales can drop and the company can still maintain the same profitability as before the price hike.

- **11-13** If the company’s original contribution margin was 40 percent, calculate the new contribution margin if price is increased 10 percent. Refer to Appendix 2.
