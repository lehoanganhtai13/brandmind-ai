# Social marketing
Create “healthy, beautiful smiles for life.” Here, however, we narrow our focus to the marketing of **social ideas**. This area has been called **social marketing** and consists of using traditional business marketing concepts and tools to encourage behaviors that will create individual and societal well-being.

Social marketing programs cover a wide range of issues. The Ad Council of America (www.adcouncil.org), for example, has developed dozens of social advertising campaigns involving issues ranging from health care, education, and environmental sustainability to human rights and personal safety. But social marketing involves much more than just advertising. It involves a broad range of marketing strategies and marketing mix tools designed to bring about beneficial social change.⁶

# Product and Service Decisions
Marketers make product and service decisions at three levels: individual product decisions, product line decisions, and product mix decisions. We discuss each in turn.

## Individual Product and Service Decisions
**Figure 8.2** shows the important decisions in the development and marketing of individual products and services. We will focus on decisions about *product attributes, branding, packaging, labeling and logos,* and *product support services.*

### Product and Service Attributes
Developing a product or service involves defining the benefits that it will offer. These benefits are communicated and delivered by product attributes such as *quality, features,* and *style and design.*

#### Product Quality
**Product quality** is one of the marketer’s major positioning tools. Quality affects product or service performance; thus, it is closely linked to customer value and satisfaction. In the narrowest sense, quality can be defined as “no defects.” But most marketers go beyond this narrow definition. Instead, they define quality in terms of creating customer value and satisfaction. The American Society for Quality defines quality as the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied customer needs. Similarly, Siemens defines quality this way: “Quality is when our customers come back and our products don’t.”⁷

**Total quality management (TQM)** is an approach in which all of the company’s people are involved in constantly improving the quality of products, services, and business processes. For most top companies, customer-driven quality has become a way of doing business. Today, companies are taking a *return-on-quality* approach, viewing quality as an investment and holding quality efforts accountable for bottom-line results.

Product quality has two dimensions: level and consistency. In developing a product, the marketer must first choose a *quality level* that will support the product’s positioning. Here, product quality means **performance quality**—the product’s ability to perform its functions. For example, a Rolls-Royce provides higher performance quality than a Chevrolet: It has a smoother ride, lasts longer, and provides more handcraftsmanship, custom design, luxury, and “creature comforts.” Companies rarely try to offer the highest possible performance quality level; few customers want or can afford the high levels of quality offered in products such as a Rolls-Royce automobile, a Viking range, or a Rolex watch. Instead, companies choose a quality level that matches target market needs and the quality levels of competing products.

Beyond quality level, high quality also can mean high levels of quality consistency. Here, product quality means **conformance quality**—freedom from defects and consistency in delivering a targeted level of performance. All companies should strive for high levels

### Figure 8.2  
**Individual Product Decisions**

> Don’t forget Figure 8.1.  
> The focus of all of these decisions is to create core customer value.

This table outlines a sequential, linear process for developing and presenting a product, moving from its intrinsic characteristics to its external presentation and post-purchase experience. The process begins with defining core **Product attributes**, which then inform the creation of a **Branding** strategy. This branding is subsequently translated into the **Packaging** design. Following packaging, **Labeling and logos** are applied, serving as key visual identifiers. Finally, the product offering is augmented by **Product support services**, completing the comprehensive product development and marketing framework. The arrows indicate a clear progression, suggesting that each stage builds upon the decisions made in the preceding one. Five Guys has kept a strong focus on making better quality burgers, and this has earned them a loyal following of burger fans who want superior quality and don’t mind paying a little extra for it.
