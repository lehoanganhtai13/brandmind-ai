# 17.1 Social Media Monetization: Making Money without Driving Fans Away

Whether it’s on massive networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat or lesser-known niche sites such as Blurty, Dogster, and Reddit, it’s common to see people everywhere these days, heads down with devices in hand, connecting, posting, messaging, and sharing. On Facebook alone, every day, a mind-blowing 1 billion of the network’s 1.6 billion active users worldwide upload 350 million photos, generate 4.5 billion Likes, and share 4.75 billion pieces of content.

However, even as social media networks have achieved incredible success in terms of numbers of users, sheer volume of content and activity, and company valuations, a nagging problem still plagues them. It’s called **monetization**. How can social media profitably tap the marketing potential of their massive communities to make money without driving off their legions of loyal users? Most social media still struggle to make a profit, and even the most popular ones are only beginning to tap their full financial potential.

The first and best bet for converting the social-sharing potential of a social network’s gigantic user community into real dollars is online advertising. For marketers, the targeting and customer engagement potential of social media is a dream come true, and advertisers willingly pay for access via ads and other paid brand content. But successfully injecting brand content alongside user content can be tricky and risky. Social media users often cherish the free (and commercial-free) sharing cultures of their online communities. If not well conceived, commercial content becomes an unwelcome intrusion that can alienate users and potentially drive them away.

Thus, although social media have exploded in popularity, most are still having trouble making money. Even Facebook—far and away the most financially successful social network, which earned $3.7 billion in profits on $18 billion in revenues last year—has little more than scratched the surface of its vast financial potential.

To illustrate the monetization difficulties that social media face, let’s dig deeper into one of today’s most successful ones, Snapchat, the wildly popular messaging app. Snapchat serves a fast-growing community of approximately 200 million users, heavily weighted toward young millennials and Gen Z. Snapchat started as a messaging app for sharing pictures and videos—known as Snaps—that disappear without a trace after a few seconds. But it has now morphed into a full and vibrant communication platform. Snapchatters can choose from a full menu of options, including text, photos, drawings, video notes, audio notes, video calls, and audio calls, all in fullscreen glory. Snapchat also offers up a variety of news and entertainment content.

Snapchat exploded onto the scene only five years ago. By the end of its first year, 1 billion photos had been shared through Snapchat’s servers; today more than 100 million daily Snapchat users share some 10 billion daily video views. As Snapchat’s popularity soared, so did its valuation. Two years in, Facebook made Snapchat’s founders a then-startling $3 billion buyout offer; the founders politely declined. Today, Snapchat has raised more than $1.1 billion in venture capital funding and is valued at $16 billion. Yet in its rise to glory, Snapchat only recently started to generate revenue of any kind and has yet to make even a dime of profits.

Snapchat’s financial story is typical for successful social media: modest beginnings as a start-up followed by meteoric growth in popularity and use leading to outrageously high valuation—all with little or no income. Then comes that difficult question: How can they monetize their massive user bases to make profits and sustain themselves? For Snapchat, that’s especially difficult. The very feature that makes Snapchat unique and so popular—content lasting only seconds—makes it difficult to track and analyze users for targeting purposes, a turnoff to marketers. In this era of big data, how can Snapchat, which collects no user data, attract marketers? Snapchat’s challenge is to persuade marketers that the benefits of reaching its young millennials and Gen Z community outweigh user anonymity and lack of pinpoint targeting potential.

Careful not to ruffle its community’s sensitivities or disrupt the user experience, Snapchat didn’t introduce its first advertising opportunities until October 2014. However, it now offers several ad platforms. At the most basic level, Snapchat sells traditional paid video ad placements alongside other site content. Next, it offers a magazine-like platform called “Discover.” Discover is a Snapchat content area where publishers ranging from ESPN, CNN, Comedy Central, and Food Channel to *Cosmopolitan*,
