Assuming HD’s beginning and ending inventories were $30 million and $20 million, respectively, the inventory turnover rate is:

$$
\text{Inventory turnover rate} = \frac{55,000,000}{\frac{(30,000,000 + 20,000,000)}{2}} = \frac{55,000,000}{25,000,000} = 2.2
$$

That is, HD’s inventory turned over 2.2 times in 2017. Normally, the higher the turnover rate, the higher the management efficiency and company profitability. However, this rate should be compared to industry averages, competitors’ rates, and past performance to determine if HD is doing well. A competitor with similar sales but a higher inventory turnover rate will have fewer resources tied up in inventory, allowing it to invest in other areas of the business.

**Return on investment (ROI)**  
A measure of managerial effectiveness and efficiency—net profit before taxes divided by total investment.

Companies frequently use **return on investment (ROI)** to measure managerial effectiveness and efficiency. For HD, ROI is the ratio of net profits to total investment required to manufacture the new product. This investment includes capital investments in land, buildings, and equipment (here, the initial $10 million to refurbish the manufacturing facility) plus inventory costs (HD’s average inventory totaled $25 million), for a total of $35 million. Thus, HD’s ROI for this product is:

$$
\text{Return on investment} = \frac{\text{net profit before taxes}}{\text{investment}} = \frac{-1,000,000}{35,000,000} = -0.0286 = -2.86\%
$$

ROI is often used to compare alternatives, and a positive ROI is desired. The alternative with the highest ROI is preferred to other alternatives. HD needs to be concerned with the ROI realized. One obvious way HD can increase ROI is to increase net profit by reducing expenses. Another way is to reduce its investment, perhaps by investing less in inventory and turning it over more frequently.

### Marketing Profitability Metrics

Given the above financial results, you may be thinking that HD should drop this new product. But what arguments can marketers make for keeping or dropping this product? The obvious arguments for dropping the product are that first-year sales were well below expected levels and the product lost money, resulting in a negative return on investment.

So what would happen if HD did drop this product? Surprisingly, if the company drops the product, the profits for the total organization will decrease by $4 million! How can that be? Marketing managers need to look closely at the numbers in the profit-and-loss statement to determine the *net marketing contribution* for this product. In HD’s case, the net marketing contribution for the product is $4 million, and if the company drops this product, that contribution will disappear as well. Let’s look more closely at this concept to illustrate how marketing managers can better assess and defend their marketing strategies and programs.

**Net Marketing Contribution**

**Net marketing contribution (NMC)**  
A measure of marketing profitability that includes only components of profitability controlled by marketing.

Net marketing contribution (NMC), along with other marketing metrics derived from it, measures *marketing* profitability. It includes only components of profitability that are controlled by marketing. Whereas the previous calculation of net profit before taxes from the profit-and-loss statement includes operating expenses not under marketing’s control, NMC does not. Referring back to HD’s profit-and-loss statement given in Table A2.2, we can calculate net marketing contribution for the product as:

$$
\text{NMC} = \text{net sales} - \text{cost of goods sold} - \text{marketing expenses}
$$

$$
= 4 \text{ million} = 100 \text{ million} - 55 \text{ million} - 41 \text{ million}
$$

The marketing expenses include sales expenses ($15 million), promotion expenses ($14 million), freight expenses ($10 million), and the managerial salaries and expenses of the marketing function ($2 million), which total $41 million.

Thus, the product actually contributed $4 million to HD’s profits. It was the $5 million of indirect overhead allocated to this product that caused the negative profit. Further, the amount allocated was $2 million more than estimated in the pro forma profit-and-loss statement. Indeed, if only the estimated amount had been allocated, the product would have earned a *profit* of $1 million rather than losing $1 million. If HD drops the product, the $5 million in fixed overhead expenses will not disappear—it will simply have to be allocated elsewhere. However, the $4 million in net marketing contribution *will* disappear.
