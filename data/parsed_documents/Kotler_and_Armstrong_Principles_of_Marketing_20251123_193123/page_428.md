# Engaging Consumers and Communicating Customer Value

For example, think about television viewing these days. Consumers can now watch their favorite programs on just about anything with a screen—on televisions but also laptops, smartphones, or tablets. And they can choose to watch programs whenever and wherever they wish, often without commercials. Increasingly, some programs, ads, and videos are being produced only for online viewing.

Despite the shift toward digital media, however, traditional mass media still capture a sizable share of the promotion budgets of most major marketing firms, a fact that probably won’t change quickly. Thus, rather than the old-media model collapsing completely, most marketers foresee a shifting mix of both traditional mass media and online, mobile, and social media that engage more-targeted consumer communities in a more personalized way. In the end, regardless of the communications channel, the key is to integrate all of these media in a way that best engages customers, communicates the brand message, and enhances the customer’s brand experiences.

As the marketing communications environment shifts, so will the role of marketing communicators. Rather than just creating and placing “TV ads” or “print ads” or “Snapchat branded story ads,” many marketers now view themselves more broadly as **content marketing** managers. As such, they create, inspire, and share brand messages and conversations with and among customers across a fluid mix of *paid*, *owned*, *earned*, and *shared* communication channels. These channels include media that are both traditional and new as well as controlled and not controlled. It’s not just advertising anymore, notes one ad agency executive. “It’s about [communications] context and channels now, rather than just the message itself. It’s about mapping the customer journey to start a conversation with consumers, one that leads to engagement, purchase, loyalty, and advocacy at different touchpoints against this integrated journey.”[^5]

## The Need for Integrated Marketing Communications

The shift toward a richer mix of media and content approaches poses a problem for marketers. Consumers today are bombarded by brand messages from a broad range of sources. But all too often, companies fail to integrate their various communication channels. Mass-media ads say one thing, whereas company’s internet site, emails, social media pages, or videos posted on YouTube say something altogether different.

One problem is that marketing content often comes from different parts of the company. Advertising messages are prepared by the advertising department or an ad agency. Other company departments or agencies prepare public relations messages, sales promotion events, and online or social media content. However, consumers don’t distinguish between content sources the way marketers do. In the consumer’s mind, brand-related content from different sources—whether it’s a Super Bowl ad, in-store display, mobile app, or friend’s social media post—all merge into a single message about the brand or company. Conflicting content from these different sources can result in confused company images, brand positions, and customer relationships.

Thus, the explosion of online, mobile, and social media marketing presents tremendous opportunities but also big challenges. It gives marketers rich new tools for understanding and engaging customers. At the same time, it complicates and fragments overall marketing communications. The challenge is to bring it all together in an organized way. To that end, most companies practice the concept of **integrated marketing communications (IMC)**. Under this concept, as illustrated in ● Figure 14.1, the company carefully integrates its many communication channels to deliver a clear, consistent, and compelling message about the organization and its brands.

Often, different media play unique roles in engaging, informing, and persuading consumers. For example, a recent study showed that more than two-thirds of advertisers and their agencies are planning video ad campaigns that stretch across multiple viewing platforms, such as traditional TV and digital, mobile, and social media. Such *video convergence*, as it’s called, combines TV’s core strength—vast reach—with digital’s better targeting,
