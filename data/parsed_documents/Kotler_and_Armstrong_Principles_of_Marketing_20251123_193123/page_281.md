# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines a structured approach to new product development and management, encompassing several key areas. It begins with the fundamental *New Product Development Process*, detailing its sequential steps and critical management considerations. Following this, the focus shifts to *Product Life-Cycle Strategies*, which involves understanding the distinct stages of a product's life cycle and adapting marketing strategies accordingly. Finally, the framework addresses *Additional Product and Service Considerations*, highlighting the importance of socially responsible decision-making and the complexities of international product and services marketing. This progression moves from the initial creation and launch of a product through its market journey and broader strategic implications.

## AS THE SAMSUNG STORY SUGGESTS

Companies that excel at developing and managing new products reap big rewards. Every product seems to go through a life cycle: It is born, goes through several phases, and eventually dies as newer products come along that create new or greater value for customers.

This product life cycle presents two major challenges: First, because all products eventually decline, a firm must be good at developing new products to replace aging ones (the challenge of *new product development*). Second, a firm must be good at adapting its marketing strategies in the face of changing tastes, technologies, and competition as products pass through stages (the challenge of *product life-cycle strategies*). We first look at the problem of finding and developing new products and then at the problem of managing them successfully over their life cycles.

> New products are the lifeblood of a company. As old products mature and fade away, companies must develop new ones to take their place. For example, the iPhone and iPad have been around for only about a decade but are now Apple’s two top-selling products.

### New Product Development Strategy

A firm can obtain new products in two ways. One is through *acquisition*—by buying a whole company, a patent, or a license to produce someone else’s product. The other is through the firm’s own **new product development** efforts. By *new products* we mean original products, product improvements, product modifications, and new brands that the firm develops through its own product development. In this chapter, we concentrate on new product development.

New products are important to both customers and the marketers who serve them: They bring new solutions and variety to customers’ lives, and they are a key source of growth for companies. In today’s fast-changing environment, many companies rely on new products for the majority of their growth. For example, new products have almost completely transformed Apple in recent years. The iPhone and iPad—both introduced only within the past decade or so—are now the company’s two biggest-selling products, with the iPhone alone bringing in more than 62 percent of Apple’s total global revenues and 77 percent of device unit sales.

Yet innovation can be very expensive and very risky. New products face tough odds. For example, by one estimate, 60 percent of all new consumer packaged products introduced by established companies fail; two-thirds of new product concepts are never even launched. Why do so many new products fail? There are several reasons. Although an idea may be good, the company may overestimate market size. The actual product may be poorly designed. Or it might be incorrectly positioned, launched at the wrong time, priced...
