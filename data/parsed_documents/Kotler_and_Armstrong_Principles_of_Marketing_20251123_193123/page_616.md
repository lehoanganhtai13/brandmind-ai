# Societal Marketing

**Deficient products**  
Products that have neither immediate appeal nor long-run benefits.

**Pleasing products**  
Products that give high immediate satisfaction but may hurt consumers in the long run.

**Salutary products**  
Products that have low immediate appeal but may benefit consumers in the long run.

**Desirable products**  
Products that give both high immediate satisfaction and high long-run benefits.

Adopted substantial social and environmental responsibility missions. Rather than being at odds with revenues and profits, purpose-driven missions can drive them. For example, sense-of-mission marketing and doing what’s right for customers has helped transform CVS into the nation’s largest health-care company (see Real Marketing 20.2).

Following the principle of **societal marketing**, a company makes marketing decisions by considering consumers’ wants, the company’s requirements, consumers’ long-run interests, and society’s long-run interests. Companies should be aware that neglecting consumer and societal long-run interests is a disservice to consumers and society. Alert companies view societal problems as opportunities.

Sustainable marketing calls for products that are not only pleasing but also beneficial. The difference is shown in **Figure 20.4**. Products can be classified according to their degree of immediate consumer satisfaction and long-run consumer benefit.

**Deficient products**, such as bad-tasting and ineffective medicine, have neither immediate appeal nor long-run benefits. **Pleasing products** give high immediate satisfaction but may hurt consumers in the long run. Examples include cigarettes and junk food. **Salutary products** have low immediate appeal but may benefit consumers in the long run, for instance, bicycle helmets or some insurance products. **Desirable products** give both high immediate satisfaction and high long-run benefits, such as a tasty *and* nutritious breakfast food.

Companies should try to turn all of their products into desirable products. The challenge posed by pleasing products is that they sell very well but may end up hurting the consumer. The product opportunity, therefore, is to add long-run benefits without reducing the product’s pleasing qualities. The challenge posed by salutary products is to add some pleasing qualities so that they will become more desirable in consumers’ minds.

Consider method, the “people against dirty” brand of household and personal cleaning products. Many effective household cleaning products contain chemicals or even toxic ingredients that can be harmful to people and the environment. But method products are formulated with naturally derived, biodegradable ingredients, nontoxic ingredients. “We prefer ingredients that come from plants, not chemical plants,” says the brand. Method also uses recycled and recyclable packaging, and it works with suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of producing its products. Method uses renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and solar trees to help power its Chicago manufacturing facility. In all, “method cleaners put the hurt on dirt without doing harm to people, creatures, or the planet,” says the company. As method cofounder and “chief greenskeeper” puts it: “Beautiful design and environmental responsibility are equally important when creating a product and we shouldn’t have to trade functionality for sustainability.”

This table presents a four-category framework for classifying products based on their immediate consumer satisfaction and long-run consumer benefit. The framework is structured as a 2x2 matrix. Products offering high immediate satisfaction and high long-run consumer benefit are categorized as **Desirable products**. Conversely, those with low immediate satisfaction and low long-run consumer benefit are termed Deficient products. Products that provide high immediate satisfaction but offer low long-run consumer benefit are classified as Pleasing products. Finally, products with low immediate satisfaction but high long-run consumer benefit are identified as Salutary products. This classification system highlights the trade-offs between short-term gratification and sustained value for consumers.

> **The goal?** Create desirable products—those that create both immediate customer satisfaction and long-run benefit. For example, Method home and personal cleaning products “put the hurt on dirt without doing harm to people, creatures, or the planet.”
