# 15 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review

Companies must do more than make good products; they have to engage consumers, inform them persuasively about product benefits, and carefully position products in consumers’ minds. To do this, they must master *advertising* and *public relations*.

**OBJECTIVE 15-1** Define the role of advertising in the promotion mix. _(p 452)_

Advertising—the use of paid media by a seller to inform, persuade, and remind buyers about its products or its organization—is an important promotion tool for engaging customers and communicating the value that marketers create for customers. American marketers spend more than $190 billion each year on advertising; worldwide spending exceeds $545 billion. Advertising takes many forms and has many uses. Although advertising is employed mostly by business firms, a wide range of not-for-profit organizations, professionals, and social agencies also employ advertising to promote their causes to various target publics. *Public relations*—gaining favorable publicity and creating a favorable company image—is the least used of the major promotion tools, although it has great potential for building consumer awareness and preference.

**OBJECTIVE 15-2** Describe the major decisions involved in developing an advertising program. _(pp 453–470)_

Advertising decision making involves making decisions about the advertising objectives, budget, messages and media, and evaluation of the results. Advertisers should set clear target, task, and timing *objectives*, whether the aim is to inform, engage, persuade, or remind buyers. Advertising’s goal is to move consumers through the buyer-readiness stages discussed in Chapter 14. Some advertising is designed to move people to immediate action. However, many of the ads you see today focus on building or strengthening long-term customer engagement and relationships. The advertising *budget* depends on many factors. No matter what method is used, setting the advertising budget is no easy task.

Advertising strategy consists of two major elements: creating advertising *messages and content* and selecting advertising *media*. The *message decision* calls for planning a message strategy and executing it effectively. Good messages and other content are especially important in today’s costly and cluttered advertising environment. Just to gain and hold attention, today’s messages must be better planned, more imaginative, more entertaining, and more rewarding to consumers. In fact, many marketers are now subscribing to a new merging of advertising and entertainment, dubbed *Madison & Vine*. The *media decision* involves defining reach, frequency, impact, and engagement goals; choosing major media types; selecting media vehicles; and choosing media timing. Message and media decisions must be closely coordinated for maximum campaign effectiveness.

Finally, *evaluation* calls for evaluating the communication and sales effects of advertising before, during, and after ads are placed. Advertising accountability has become a hot issue for most companies. Increasingly, top management is asking: “What return are we getting on our advertising investment?” and “How do we know that we’re spending the right amount?” Other important advertising issues involve *organizing* for advertising and dealing with the complexities of international advertising.

**OBJECTIVE 15-3** Define the role of public relations in the promotion mix. _(pp 470–472)_

*Public relations*, or PR, is used to promote products, people, places, ideas, activities, organizations, and even nations. Companies use PR to build good relationships with consumers, investors, the media, and their communities. PR can have a strong impact on public awareness at a much lower cost than advertising can, and PR results can sometimes be spectacular. Although PR still captures only a modest portion of the overall marketing budgets of many firms, it is playing an increasingly important brand-building role. In the digital, mobile, and social media age, the lines between advertising and PR are becoming more and more blurred.

**OBJECTIVE 15-4** Explain how companies use public relations to communicate with their publics. _(p 472)_

Companies use PR to communicate with their publics by setting PR objectives, choosing PR messages and vehicles, implementing the PR plan, and evaluating PR results. To accomplish these goals, PR professionals use several tools, such as news and special events. They also prepare written, audiovisual, and corporate identity materials and contribute money and time to public service activities. The internet has also become an increasingly important PR channel, as websites, blogs, and social media are providing interesting new ways to reach more people.
