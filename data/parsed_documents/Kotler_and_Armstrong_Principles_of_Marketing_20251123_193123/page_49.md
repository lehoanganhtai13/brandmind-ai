# 1.2 Real-Time Marketing: Engaging Consumers in the Moment

A funny thing happened during Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans. Early in the third quarter, the lights in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome suddenly went out. As 71,000 attendees and 106 million viewers restlessly bided their time and scratched their heads, engineers worked feverishly for a full 34 minutes to repair the power outage and bring the lights back on. But whereas the blackout was a disaster for Superdome management and CBS Sports and an annoyance for players and fans, at least one marketer saw it as an opportunity. Shortly after the blackout began, Nabisco’s Oreo brand tweeted out a simple message: “Power out? No problem. You can still dunk in the dark.”

That now-famous single tweet, conceived and approved within just minutes, grabbed more attention for Oreo than the brand’s extravagant first-quarter advertisement. Within an hour, the “dunk in the dark” message was retweeted nearly 16,000 times and racked up more than 20,000 Facebook likes, resulting in tens of millions of favorable exposures. In the following days, Oreo received tons of media coverage and was hailed as “The Brand That Won the Blackout Bowl.” Those were pretty impressive results for a one-off joke by a cookie maker.

Oreo’s successful Super Bowl one-liner triggered a surge in real-time marketing. Brands of all kinds have since tried to create their own “Oreo moments” by aligning marketing content with real-world events and trending topics through timely tweets, videos, blog entries, and social media posts.

Today, many real-time marketing efforts center on major media events, such as the Super Bowl, the Grammys, and the Academy Awards. These events let marketers engage huge, ready-made audiences. For example, when its blockbuster feature *The LEGO Movie* failed to win a nomination in the Best Animated Movie category at a recent Oscars, LEGO turned the snub into an opportunity to engage viewers in real time during the Academy Awards TV spectacular. During a performance of the movie’s Oscar-nominated song—“Everything Is Awesome”—performers handed out Oscars made of golden LEGO bricks to celebrities in the audience. Simultaneously, the brand tweeted coordinated real-time images and the message “#EverythingIsAwesome at the #Oscars!” With pictures of stars such as Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood, Oprah Winfrey, and Bradley Cooper posing with their LEGO Oscars, #LegoOscar became the number-one trending topic on Twitter.

Other companies use real-time efforts to connect their brands to current events important to customers. Starbucks has long used real-time marketing in this way. For example, after Winter Storm Nemo hit the northeastern United States with heavy snowfall and hurricane-force winds in early 2013, Starbucks Twitter and Facebook promotions offered free “Snow Day” coffee to customers in affected areas. “We wanted to make a grand [and timely] gesture,” said a Starbucks digital marketer. As another example, Red Roof Inn regularly links airline flight data from flight tracking service FlightAware with Google’s online search-ad system to beam real-time ads to stranded travelers facing flight cancellations. For example, when Chicago’s O’Hare Airport recently experienced a major bout of flight cancellations, Red Roof managed to secure the top ad spot in three-quarters of the Google search results for “hotels near O’Hare,” resulting in a 60 percent jump in bookings from those searches.

Companies sometimes set up temporary real-time command centers, or “war rooms,” to create rapid responses during major events or even to counter competitor’s moves. For example, with each new Apple iPhone model, at the very same time that Apple executives are on stage unveiling the features of the new phone, Samsung marketers are flooding social media with clever real-time “The next best thing is already here” responses. The strategy lets Samsung capitalize on the buzz surrounding the Apple introductions to promote its own wares.

Done right, real-time marketing can engage consumers in the moment and make a brand more relevant. Done poorly, however, real-time engagements can come off as little more than awkward or inappropriate intrusions. Too often, brands simply toss standalone, last-minute ads or messages into social channels, hoping to “catch lightning in a bottle.” But hastily prepared real-time content can fall flat or miss the mark. Worse, self-serving real-time messages can easily backfire, painting the brand as opportunistic or out of touch.

Minute-by-minute marketing strikes rarely succeed. Instead, to be consistently successful, real-time marketing must be part of a broader, carefully conceived strategy that makes the brand itself an engaging and relevant part of Consumers’ lives.
