## Break-Even Chart for Determining Target Return Price and Break-Even Volume

This data presents a direct relationship between sales volume and cost, illustrating a linear cost behavior. The table shows that as sales volume, measured in thousands of units, increases from 0 to 50, the associated cost, expressed in thousands of dollars, also increases proportionally. Specifically, a sales volume of 0 units corresponds to a cost of $0 thousand. For every 10,000 unit increase in sales volume, the cost rises by $200 thousand. This pattern continues up to a sales volume of 50,000 units, which incurs a cost of $1,000 thousand. The final entry indicates a cost of $1,200 thousand without a corresponding sales volume, suggesting a potential outlier or a different cost component not directly tied to the unit sales volume presented. The structure is comparative, highlighting the cost implications at various sales levels.

> At the break-even point, here 30,000 units, total revenue equals total cost.

- The chart shows three lines:
  - **Fixed cost**: horizontal line at about 300 (thousands)
  - **Total cost**: rising line starting at fixed cost and increasing with sales volume
  - **Total revenue**: rising line starting at zero and crossing total cost at 30,000 units

- **Target return ($200,000)** is marked on the total revenue line at about 50,000 units.

> To make a target return of $200,000, the company must sell 50,000 units. But will customers buy that many units at the $20 price? The company should consider different prices and estimate break-even volumes and probable demand at each price. Take a look at Table 10.1.

The total revenue and total cost curves cross at 30,000 units. This is the *break-even volume*. At $20, the company must sell at least 30,000 units to break even, that is, for total revenue to cover total cost. Break-even volume can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{break-even volume} = \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{price} - \text{variable cost}} = \frac{300,000}{20 - 10} = 30,000
$$

If the company wants to make a profit, it must sell more than 30,000 units at $20 each. Suppose the toaster manufacturer has invested $1,000,000 in the business and wants to set a price to earn a 20 percent return, or $200,000. In that case, it must sell at least 50,000 units at $20 each. If the company charges a higher price, it will not need to sell as many toasters to achieve its target return. But the market may not buy even this lower volume at the higher price. Much depends on price elasticity and competitors’ prices.

The manufacturer should consider different prices and estimate break-even volumes, probable demand, and profits for each. This is done in **Table 10.1**. The table shows that as price increases, the break-even volume drops (column 2). But as price increases, the demand for toasters also decreases (column 3). At the $14 price, because the manufacturer clears only $4 per toaster ($14 less $10 in variable costs), it must sell a very high volume to break even. Even though the low price attracts many buyers, demand still falls below the high break-even point, and the manufacturer loses money. At the other extreme, with a $22 price, the manufacturer clears $12 per toaster and must sell only 25,000 units to break even. But at this high price, consumers buy too few toasters, and profits are negative. The table shows that a price of $18 yields the highest profits. Note that none of the prices produce the manufacturer’s target return of $200,000. To achieve this return, the manufacturer will have to search for ways to lower the fixed or variable costs, thus lowering the break-even volume.

# Table 10.1  
## Break-Even Volume and Profits at Different Prices

This table presents a comparative analysis of pricing strategies, detailing the financial implications of different price points. For each price level, it outlines the Unit Demand Needed to Break Even, the Expected Unit Demand at that price, and calculates the resulting Total Revenue, Total Costs, and Profit. The data demonstrates a trend where increasing the price from $14 to $18 initially boosts profit, reaching a maximum of $180,000 at $18, driven by a higher profit margin per unit despite a decrease in expected demand. However, further price increases to $20 and $22 lead to a decline in profit, with expected demand falling below the break-even point at $22, resulting in a loss. This structure highlights the trade-off between price, demand, and profitability, illustrating how optimal pricing balances these factors to maximize financial gain.

*Assumes fixed costs of $300,000 and constant unit variable costs of $10.
