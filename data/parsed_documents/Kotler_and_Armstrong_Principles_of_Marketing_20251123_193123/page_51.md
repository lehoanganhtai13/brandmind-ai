Mobile marketing is perhaps the fastest-growing digital marketing platform. Smartphones are ever present, always on, finely targeted, and highly personal. This makes them ideal for engaging customers anytime, anywhere as they move through the buying process. For example, Starbucks customers can use their mobile devices for everything from finding the nearest Starbucks and learning about new products to placing and paying for orders.

Four out of five smartphone users use their phones to shop—browsing product information through apps or the mobile web, making in-store price comparisons, reading online product reviews, finding and redeeming coupons, and more. Almost 30 percent of all online purchases are now made from mobile devices, and mobile online sales are growing 2.6 times faster than total online sales. During this past holiday season, mobile shoppers made up more than 70 percent of traffic to Walmart.com, accounting for almost half the site’s orders over the Black Friday weekend.  

Marketers use mobile channels to stimulate immediate buying, make shopping easier, enrich the brand experience, or all of these. Consider Redbox:

> Redbox DVD rental kiosks are unmanned, so the company has to find innovative ways to engage customers and personalize its service—most of which it does through its website and mobile app, text messaging, and email. Customers can use the Redbox mobile app to locate Redbox kiosks, check availability of movies and games, and reserve rentals for quick pickup. Mobile customers can also join the Redbox Text Club to receive texts about the latest Redbox news, releases, and members-only deals.  
>  
> Text Club members are Redbox’s most valuable customers, so the company launched a 10-day-long mobile marketing campaign to increase membership. Using large call-to-action stickers on kiosks, a blast of email, and posts on its Facebook and other social media pages, Redbox offered discounts of between 10 cents and $1.50 on the next DVD rental to customers who texted the word “DEALS” to 727272. The campaign—called “The 10 Days of Deals”—generated nearly 1.5 million text messages from some 400,000 customers, resulting in more than 200,000 new Text Club members. “Mobile is like having a kiosk in your hand,” explains Redbox’s chief marketer. “It’s an incredibly important part of our [marketing] strategy.”  

Although online, social media, and mobile marketing offer huge potential, most marketers are still learning how to use them effectively. The key is to blend the new digital approaches with traditional marketing to create a smoothly integrated marketing strategy and mix. We will examine digital, mobile, and social media marketing throughout the text—they touch almost every area of marketing strategy and tactics. Then, after we’ve covered the marketing basics, we’ll look more deeply into digital and direct marketing in Chapter 17.

## The Changing Economic Environment  
The Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 and its aftermath hit American consumers hard. After two decades of overspending, new economic realities forced consumers to bring their consumption back in line with their incomes and rethink their buying priorities.

In today’s post-recession era, consumer incomes and spending are again on the rise. However, even as the economy has strengthened, rather than reverting to their old free-spending ways, Americans are now showing a new enthusiasm for frugality. Sensible consumption has made a comeback, and it appears to be here to stay. The new consumer spending values emphasize simpler living and more value for the dollar.
