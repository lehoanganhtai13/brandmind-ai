# 10 Pricing  
## Understanding and Capturing Customer Value

> **CHAPTER PREVIEW**  
> In this chapter, we look at the second major marketing mix tool—pricing. If effective product development, promotion, and distribution sow the seeds of business success, effective pricing is the harvest. Firms successful at creating customer value with the other marketing mix activities must still capture some of this value in the prices they earn. In this chapter, we discuss the importance of pricing, dig into three major pricing strategies, and look at internal and external considerations that affect pricing decisions. In the next chapter, we examine some additional pricing considerations and approaches.  
>  
> For openers, let’s examine the importance of pricing in online retailing. In case you haven’t noticed, there’s a war going on—between Walmart, by far the world’s largest retailer, and Amazon, the planet’s largest online merchant. Each combatant brings an arsenal of potent weapons to the battle. For now, the focus is on price. But in the long run, it’ll take much more than low prices to win this war. The spoils will go to the company that delivers the best overall online customer experience and value for the price.

## AMAZON VERSUS WALMART: A Price War for Online Supremacy

> **“Walmart to Amazon: Let’s Rumble”** read the headline. Ali had Frazier. Coke has Pepsi. The Yankees have the Red Sox. And now, the two retail heavyweights are waging a war all their own. The objective? Online supremacy. The weapon of choice? Prices, at least for now—not surprising, given the two combatants’ long-held low-cost positions.  
>  
> Each side is formidable in its own right. Walmart dominates offline retailing. Its price-driven “Save money. Live better.” positioning has made it far and away the world’s largest retailer, and the world’s largest company to boot. In turn, Amazon is the “Walmart of the Web”—our online general store. Although Walmart’s yearly sales total an incredible $482 billion, more than 4.5 times Amazon’s $107 billion annually, Amazon’s online sales are nearly 8 times greater than Walmart’s online sales. By one estimate, Amazon captured nearly 40 percent of all online sales during the most recent year-end holiday season, more than the combined online sales of the next 21 retail competitors.  
>  
> Why does Walmart worry about Amazon? After all, online sales currently account for only about 7 percent of total U.S. retail sales. Walmart captures most of its business through its 11,000 brick-and-mortar stores—online buying accounts for only a trifling 2.8 percent of its total sales. But this battle isn’t about now, it’s about the future. Online sales are growing at three times the rate of physical-world sales. Within the next decade, online and mobile buying will capture as much as a third of all retail buying. Because Amazon owns online, its revenues have soared 20 percent or more annually over the past four years. Meanwhile, Walmart’s total sales growth has pretty much flatlined during that period. Amazon’s revenues reached the $100 billion mark faster than any other company in history.  
>  
> Amazon has shown a relentless ambition to offer more of almost everything online. It started by selling only books but now sells everything from books, movies, and music to consumer electronics, home and garden products, clothing, jewelry, toys, tools, and even groceries. Thus, Amazon’s online prowess now looms as a significant threat to Walmart. If Amazon’s expansion continues and online sales spurt as predicted, the digital merchant will eat further and further into Walmart’s bread-and-butter store sales.

> **Blue Box Text:**  
> Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, and Amazon, the world’s largest online merchant, are fighting a war for online supremacy. The weapon of choice? Prices, at least for now. But in the long run, winning the war will take much more than low prices.
