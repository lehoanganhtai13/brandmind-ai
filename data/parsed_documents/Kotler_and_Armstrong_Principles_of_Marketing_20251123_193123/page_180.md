Evaluation. The consumer considers whether trying the new product makes sense.  
Trial. The consumer tries the new product on a small scale to improve his or her estimate of its value.  
Adoption. The consumer decides to make full and regular use of the new product.

This model suggests that marketers should think about how to help consumers move through these stages. For example, if a company finds that many consumers are considering its products but are still tentative about buying one, it might offer sales prices or special promotions that help get consumers over the decision hump. To help car buyers past purchase-decision hurdles following the economic meltdown in 2008, Hyundai offered a unique Hyundai Assurance Plan. It promised buyers who financed or leased new Hyundais that they could return them at no cost and with no harm to their credit rating if they lost their jobs or incomes within a year. Sales of the Hyundai Sonata surged 85 percent in the month following the start of the campaign.

## Individual Differences in Innovativeness

People differ greatly in their readiness to try new products. In each product area, there are “consumption pioneers” and early adopters. Other individuals adopt new products much later. People can be classified into the adopter categories shown in **Figure 5.6**. As shown by the curve, after a slow start, an increasing number of people adopt the new product. As successive groups of consumers adopt the innovation, it eventually reaches its cumulative saturation level. Innovators are defined as the first 2.5 percent of buyers to adopt a new idea (those beyond two standard deviations from mean adoption time); the early adopters are the next 13.5 percent (between one and two standard deviations); and then come early mainstream, late mainstream, and lagging adopters.

The five adopter groups have differing values. *Innovators* are venturesome—they try new ideas at some risk. *Early adopters* are guided by respect—they are opinion leaders in their communities and adopt new ideas early but carefully. *Early mainstream* adopters are deliberate—although they rarely are leaders, they adopt new ideas before the average person. *Late mainstream* adopters are skeptical—they adopt an innovation only after a majority of people have tried it. Finally, *lagging adopters* are tradition bound—they are suspicious of changes and adopt the innovation only when it has become something of a tradition itself.

This adopter classification suggests that an innovating firm should research the characteristics of innovators and early adopters in their product categories and direct initial marketing efforts toward them.

## Influence of Product Characteristics on Rate of Adoption

The characteristics of the new product affect its rate of adoption. Some products catch on almost overnight. For example, Apple’s iPod, iPhone, and iPad flew off retailers’ shelves.

## Figure 5.6
Adopter Categories Based on Relative Time of Adoption of Innovations

This table illustrates the Diffusion of Innovations theory, depicting a population's adoption rate of new ideas or technologies over time. The structure is hierarchical, progressing from the earliest adopters to the latest. At the apex are the **Innovators**, representing a small 2.5% of the population who are eager to try new things. Following them are the **Early adopters** (13.5%), influential individuals who adopt early and are respected opinion leaders. Next are the **Early mainstream** (34%), who adopt new ideas just before the average person. This group is followed by the **Late mainstream** (34%), who are skeptical and adopt only after the majority has. Finally, the largest remaining segment, **Laggards** (16%), are traditionalists who are highly skeptical of change and adopt innovations last, if at all. This distribution forms a bell curve, showing a gradual adoption process across different societal segments.
