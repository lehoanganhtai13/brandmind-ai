# Demography

Markets. They analyze changing age and family structures, geographic population shifts, educational characteristics, and population diversity. Here, we discuss the most important demographic trends in the United States.

## The Changing Age Structure of the Population

The U.S. population currently stands at nearly 323 million and may reach almost 364 million by 2030.⁶ The single most important demographic trend in the United States is the changing age structure of the population. Primarily because of falling birthrates and longer life expectancies, the U.S. population is rapidly getting older. In 1970, the median age was 28; by 2016, it was 38.⁷ This aging of the population will have a significant impact on markets and those who service them.

The U.S. population contains several generational groups. Here, we discuss the four largest groups—the baby boomers, Generation X, the millennials, and Generation Z—and their impact on today’s marketing strategies.

### Baby boomers

The 78 million people born during the years following World War II and lasting until 1964.

### Generation X

The 49 million people born between 1965 and 1976 in the “birth dearth” following the baby boom.

## The Baby Boomers

The post–World War II baby boom produced 78 million **baby boomers**, who were born between 1946 and 1964. Over the years, the baby boomers have been one of the most powerful forces shaping the marketing environment. The youngest boomers are now in their 50s; the oldest are in their early 70s and well into retirement.

The baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in U.S. history, what one analyst calls “a marketer’s dream.” Today’s baby boomers account for about 26 percent of the U.S. population but control an estimated 70 percent of the nation’s disposable income and half of all consumer spending.⁸ The boomers constitute a lucrative market for financial services, new housing and home remodeling, new cars, travel and entertainment, eating out, health and fitness products, and just about everything else. And contrary to the popular belief that they are staid in their ways, one recent survey found that 82 percent of boomers are open to new brands. Says a researcher, “Changing and trying new brands helps boomers feel like they are staying current.”⁹

It would be a mistake to think of older boomers as phasing out or slowing down. Rather than viewing themselves that way, many of today’s boomers see themselves as entering new life phases. More active boomers have no intention of abandoning their youthful lifestyles as they age. For example, adults over 50 now account for 80 percent of luxury travel spending in America. Boomers are also digitally active and increasingly social media savvy. They are the fastest-growing shopper demographic online, outspending younger generations two to one. They are also the fastest-growing social media users, with an 80 percent surge in Facebook usage over the past four years.¹⁰

Thus, although boomers buy lots of products that help them deal with issues of aging—from vitamins to blood pressure monitors to Good Grips kitchen tools—they tend to appreciate marketers who appeal to their youthful thinking rather than their advancing age.  

For example, Walgreens recently launched a campaign called “Carpe Med Diem,” telling older boomers how to “seize the day” to get more out of life and their Medicare Part D prescription coverage at Walgreens, not just with savings on prescriptions but also with products that make them look and feel good.¹¹ One “Carpe Med Diem” ad features an active and stylish boomer-age woman with purple highlights in her hair and the headline “Who says blonds have more fun.” In another ad, two boomer women pick up their prescriptions at Walgreens but also load up on sunscreen before heading out to a nude beach, where they drop their clothes and enjoy some fun in the sun. “Walgreen’s has you covered,” says the ad. “Who says that being on Medicare has to stop you from being edgy?”

Targeting baby boomers: Walgreen’s Carpe Med Diem campaign appeals to older boomers’ youthful thinking rather than advancing age. “Who says that being on Medicare has to stop you from being edgy?” Walgreen Co.

## Generation X

The baby boom was followed by a “birth dearth,” creating another generation of 49 million people born between 1965 and 1976. Author Douglas Coupland calls them **Generation X** because they lie in the shadow of the boomers.
