ensure the fastest in-flight speeds available. Every seat has its  
own power outlet, USB port, and 9-inch video touchscreen with  
a QWERTY keyboard/remote control.  

That touchscreen provides access to the most advanced  
entertainment and information system in U.S. skies. Virgin  
America’s proprietary Red system allows each guest to choose  
on-demand movies, TV programs, music, or video games. Red  
also allows patrons to track their flight on interactive Google  
Maps, engage in seat-to-seat chat with other customers, and order food and drinks for themselves or anyone else on board. It’s  
a system designed to give passengers a feeling of control during  
an experience that is otherwise mostly out of their control.  

Many of these ideas came by way of Virgin America’s techy  
clientele. It’s no accident that the company’s headquarters are  
located in Burlingame, California, just a few short miles from  
the San Francisco airport. In fact, Virgin America is the only airline based in Silicon Valley. Not only is the company constantly  
experimenting with every aspect of the business, it has made  
strong efforts to involve Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and executives in the process, helping Virgin to think like its disruptive clientele. “We see ourselves as more of an incubator,” says Luanne  
Calvert, Virgin America’s chief marketing officer.  

Take VX Next, for example—a group of 30 or so frequent fliers who act as a brain trust for Virgin America, generating ideas  
for the company at no charge. Among other winning ideas, this  
group was instrumental in developing the company’s recent interactive promotional campaign. At the center of the campaign is  
a slick cinematic site that provides viewers with a virtual tour of  
a Virgin America flight. Demonstrating the airline’s in-flight perks  
are founders and CEOs of companies such as Pandora, Gilt, and  
Pitchfork. As part of the tour, visitors to the site discover that  
several of the passengers onboard are Virgin America frequent  
fliers and Silicon Valley celebrities who have made creative contributions to the airline’s services with things such as curating  
in-flight music and menu items.  

Virgin America’s home-brewed tech panel was also instrumental in creating the company’s latest safety video. When the  
company started operations, it delighted customers with a safety  
video like none other—an animated short featuring a techie nun  
and a matador with his bull. Posted online as well, the video  
racked up millions of views and cemented Virgin America’s image as a company that could find creative alternatives to just  
about anything, even a federally mandated reminder to wear  
seatbelts. That image has carried over to Virgin America’s new  
safety video—one created by a top Hollywood director and  
world-class choreographers that features 10 So You Think You  
Can Dance alums, two former Olympians, and one American Idol  
finalist. Debuting in Times Square and getting plenty of coverage  
from the press, the new safety video racked up 6 million views in  
less than two weeks.  

## Above the Clouds  

Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that Virgin America’s  
customers are thrilled with its service, it’s the industry quality ratings that count. Virgin America is coming through with flying colors  
there as well. In fact, Virgin America has been number one in the  
annual Airline Quality Report—a survey that ranks airlines based  
on mishandled baggage, customer complaints, denied boardings,  
and on-time percent—for the past three years in a row. In a recent  
Consumer Reports survey for customer satisfaction in the airline,  
not only did Virgin America take top honors, it came away with the  
highest score achieved by any U.S. airline in many years.  

Despite all of Virgin America’s success, the airline industry  
is a tough place to survive and thrive. In the United States, just  
four airlines control more than 80 percent of the market. Virgin  
America knows that maintaining its high rankings will be a challenge, especially as it expands into new markets—particularly  
markets with cold climates, a factor that increases the likelihood  
of canceled or delayed flights. As the number of passengers  
on flights increases, boarding and deplaning times will also increase, affecting multiple customer service metrics. And with  
Virgin’s techy and connected clientele, any slip-up is likely to be  
texted, tweeted, or otherwise broadcast for all the world to see.  
Playing the features and amenities game is also problematic.  
Things that delight customers today become ho-hum tomorrow,  
especially when competitors are constantly trying to improve  
their offerings as well.  

To remain competitive as it moves into the future, Virgin  
America recently announced that it has agreed to be acquired  
by Alaska Airlines—another small West Coast–based airline  
known for its high level of service and customer loyalty. With  
more than 1,200 daily flights and 280 aircraft, the combined airline will provide much stronger competition on the West Coast,  
even with the largest airlines. This should be a boon for customers of each airline who have been frustrated by limited route  
options in the past.  

But with such a strong and unique positioning targeted toward a specific segment of the industry, many are wondering  
what effect the union of these two airlines will have on Virgin  
America’s style and quality of service. After all, if “hip” best describes Virgin America’s style, Alaska Airlines is best described  
as “practical.” “My hope is that Alaska goes in with an open  
mind and that they learn some things,” says one travel industry  
analyst. “It’s not hip, it’s not sexy, but Alaska has a lot going  
for it.”  

The deal is still subject to approval by regulators, and airline  
mergers can take years to complete. But one thing is for sure.  
Alaska Airlines is not only acquiring an airline with a strong service record, it’s taking on an unusually profitable airline. Virgin  
America achieved an annual profit after just six years. Flying in  
the face of skeptics, the brash young airline continued on its  
upward trajectory by posting strong increases in profits in each  
of the two years since. For the most recent year, Virgin America  
achieved $201 million in profit on $1.5 billion in revenues—139  
percent higher profits than the year before and the highest ever  
for a young airline. The company also recently went public in the  
second-largest airline IPO in history. The question is this: Will  
the new Virgin America continue to do what it has done in the  
past—wow every customer with exceptional service while giving  
the tech community a little something extra? Or will that special  
Virgin America brand personality slowly disappear in the shadow  
of older, more established Alaska Airlines brand?
