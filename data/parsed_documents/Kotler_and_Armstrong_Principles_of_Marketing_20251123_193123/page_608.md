# Consumer Actions to Promote Sustainable Marketing

Google claims that its practices constitute fair and effective competition.  
*Associated Press*

The European Commission claims a commanding 92 percent European market share; the Android operating system dominates with a 71 percent share.

The European Commission formally accused Google of manipulating its search-engine results to favor its own shopping services at the expense of rivals. According to the commission, such “conduct may therefore artificially divert traffic from rival comparison shopping services and hinder their ability to compete, to the detriment of consumers, as well as stifling innovation.” The commission’s future antitrust investigations could expand beyond Google’s shopping services into areas such as online and mobile searches for travel services and restaurants. For its part, however, Google contends that its web-search and mobile operations constitute fair and effective competition that serves the best interests of consumers. If the antitrust charges stand, the European Commission could hit Google with billions of dollars in fines.

> **Author Comment:** Sustainable marketing isn’t something that only businesses and governments do. Through consumerism and environmentalism, consumers themselves can play an important role.

Sustainable marketing calls for more responsible actions by both businesses and consumers. Because some people view businesses as the cause of many economic and social ills, grassroots movements have arisen from time to time to keep businesses in line. Two major movements have been *consumerism* and *environmentalism*.

## Consumerism

**Consumerism** is an organized movement of citizens and government agencies to improve the rights and power of buyers in relation to sellers. Traditional *sellers’ rights* include the following:

* The right to introduce any product in any size and style, provided it is not hazardous to personal health or safety, or, if it is, to include proper warnings and controls
* The right to charge any price for the product, provided no discrimination exists among similar kinds of buyers
* The right to spend any amount to promote the product, provided it is not defined as unfair competition
* The right to use any product message, provided it is not misleading or dishonest in content or execution
* The right to use buying incentive programs, provided they are not unfair or misleading

Traditional *buyers’ rights* include the following:

* The right not to buy a product that is offered for sale
* The right to expect the product to be safe
* The right to expect the product to perform as claimed

In comparing these rights, many believe that the balance of power lies on the seller’s side. True, the buyer can refuse to buy. But critics feel that the buyer has too little information, education, and protection to make wise decisions when facing sophisticated sellers. Consumer advocates call for the following additional consumer rights:

* The right to be well informed about important aspects of the product
* The right to be protected against questionable products and marketing practices
* The right to influence products and marketing practices in ways that will improve “quality of life”
* The right to consume now in a way that will preserve the world for future generations of consumers Consumer desire for more information led to package labels with useful facts, from ingredients and nutrition facts to recycling and country of origin information.
