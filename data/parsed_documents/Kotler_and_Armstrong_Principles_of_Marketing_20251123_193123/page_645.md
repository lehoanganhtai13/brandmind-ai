# Table A2.1 Pro Forma Profit-and-Loss Statement for the 12-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017

This table presents a hierarchical breakdown of a company's financial performance, starting with Net Sales and progressing through various expense categories to arrive at Net Profit Before Income Tax. Net Sales are established at $125,000,000, representing 100% of sales. The Cost of Goods Sold is then deducted, amounting to $62,500,000 (50% of sales), resulting in a Gross Margin of $62,500,000 (50% of sales). Following this, Marketing Expenses are detailed, encompassing Sales expenses ($17,500,000), Promotion expenses ($15,000,000), and Freight ($12,500,000), totaling $45,000,000 (36% of sales). General and Administrative Expenses, including Managerial salaries and expenses ($2,000,000) and Indirect overhead ($3,000,000), sum to $5,000,000 (4% of sales). Finally, subtracting these aggregated expenses from the Gross Margin yields a Net Profit Before Income Tax of $12,500,000, which constitutes 10% of sales.

* **Cost of goods sold** — (sometimes called *cost of sales*) — the actual cost of the merchandise sold by a manufacturer or reseller. It includes the cost of inventory, purchases, and other costs associated with making the goods. HD’s cost of goods sold is estimated to be 50% of net sales, or $62.5 million.

* **Gross margin** (or *gross profit*) — the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold. HD’s gross margin is estimated to be $62.5 million.

* **Operating expenses** — the expenses incurred while doing business. These include all other expenses beyond the cost of goods sold that are necessary to conduct business. Operating expenses can be presented in total or broken down in detail. Here, HD’s estimated operating expenses include *marketing expenses* and *general and administrative expenses*.

Marketing expenses include sales expenses, promotion expenses, and distribution expenses. The new product will be sold through HD’s sales force, so the company budgets $5 million for sales salaries. However, because sales representatives earn a 10% commission on sales, HD must also add a variable component to sales expenses of $12.5 million (10% of $125 million net sales), for a total budgeted sales expense of $17.5 million. HD sets its advertising and promotion to launch this product at $10 million. However, the company also budgets 4% of sales, or $5 million, for cooperative advertising allowances to retailers who promote HD’s new product in their advertising. Thus, the total budgeted advertising and promotion expenses are $15 million ($10 million for advertising plus $5 million in co-op allowances). Finally, HD budgets 10% of net sales, or $12.5 million, for freight and delivery charges. In all, total marketing expenses are estimated to be

General and administrative expenses are estimated at $5 million, broken down into $2 million for managerial salaries and expenses for the marketing function and $3 million of indirect overhead allocated to this product by the corporate accountants (such as depreciation, interest, maintenance, and insurance). Total expenses for the year, then, are estimated to be $50 million ($45 million marketing expenses + $5 million in general and administrative expenses).

* **Net profit before taxes** — profit earned after all costs are deducted. HD’s estimated net profit before taxes is $12.5 million.

In all, as Table A2.1 shows, HD expects to earn a profit on its new product of $12.5 million in 2017. Also note that the percentage of sales that each component of the Now let’s fast-forward a year.
