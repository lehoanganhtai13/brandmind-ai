# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

* **Greater service value.** More effective and efficient customer value creation, engagement, and service delivery, which results in . . .

* **Satisfied and loyal customers.** Satisfied customers who remain loyal, make repeat purchases, and refer other customers, which results in . . .

* **Healthy service profits and growth.** Superior service firm performance.

For example, customer-service all-star Zappos.com—the online shoes, clothing, and accessories retailers—knows that happy customers and profits begin with happy, dedicated, energetic employees. Similarly, at Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, creating delighted customers involves much more than just crafting a lofty customer-focused marketing strategy and handing it down from the top. At Four Seasons, satisfying customers is everybody’s business. And it all starts with satisfied employees:²²

> Four Seasons has perfected the art of high-touch, carefully crafted service. Whether it’s at the tropical island paradise at the Four Seasons Resort Mauritius or the luxurious sub-Saharan “camp” at the Four Seasons Safari Lodge Serengeti, guests paying $1,000 or more a night expect to have their minds read. For these guests, Four Seasons doesn’t disappoint. As one Four Seasons Maui guest once told a manager, “If there’s a heaven, I hope it’s run by Four Seasons.” What makes Four Seasons so special? It’s really no secret. It’s the quality of the Four Seasons staff. Four Seasons knows that happy, satisfied employees make for happy, satisfied customers. So just as it does for customers, Four Seasons respects and pampers its employees.  
> Four Seasons hires the best people, pays them well, orients them carefully, instills in them a sense of pride, and rewards them for outstanding service deeds. It treats employees as it would its most important guests. For example, all employees—from the maids who make up the rooms to the general manager—dine together (free of charge) in the hotel cafeteria. Perhaps best of all, every employee receives free stays at other Four Seasons resorts, six free nights per year after one year with the company. The room stays make employees feel as important and pampered as the guests they serve and motivate employees to achieve even higher levels of service in their own jobs. Says one Four Seasons staffer, “You come back from those trips on fire. You want to do so much for the guests.” As a result of such actions, the annual turnover for full-time employees at Four Seasons is only 18 percent, half the industry average. Four Seasons has been included for 18 straight years on *Fortune* magazine’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. And that’s the biggest secret to Four Seasons’ success.

Services marketing requires more than just traditional external marketing using the four Ps. **Figure 8.4** shows that services marketing also requires *internal marketing* and *interactive marketing*. **Internal marketing** means that the service firm must orient and motivate its customer-contact employees and supporting service people to work as a team to provide customer satisfaction. Marketers must get everyone in the organization to be customer centered. In fact, internal marketing must *precede* external marketing. For example, Zappos starts by hiring the right people and carefully orienting and inspiring them to give unparalleled customer service. The idea is to make certain that employees themselves believe in the brand so that they can authentically deliver the brand’s promise to customers.

**Interactive marketing** means that service quality depends heavily on the quality of the buyer–seller interaction during the service encounter. In product marketing, product quality often depends little on how the product is obtained. But in services marketing, service quality depends on both the service deliverer and the quality of delivery. Service marketers, therefore, have to master interactive marketing skills. Thus, Zappos selects

**Internal marketing**  
Orienting and motivating customer-contact employees and supporting service employees to work as a team to provide customer satisfaction.

**Interactive marketing**  
Training service employees in the fine art of interacting with customers to satisfy their needs.

### Figure 8.4  
**Three Types of Services Marketing**

This table illustrates a three-pronged approach to marketing within a service firm, emphasizing the interconnectedness of internal and external efforts. It highlights **Internal Marketing** focused on employees, **External Marketing** targeting customers, and **Interactive Marketing** as the crucial bridge between the two. Internal marketing underscores the necessity of instilling a customer-centric mindset in employees, exemplified by Zappos.com's core value of "Deliver WOW through service." Interactive marketing then focuses on equipping these employees with the skills to effectively engage with customers, as demonstrated by Zappos.com's comprehensive customer loyalty training for all staff. Ultimately, the structure suggests that successful external marketing, which directly reaches customers, is contingent upon robust internal and interactive marketing strategies that empower and train employees to deliver exceptional service.
