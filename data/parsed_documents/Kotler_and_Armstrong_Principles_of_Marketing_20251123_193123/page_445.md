The video concludes that there’s an easier way: “You don’t have to go to the ends of the Earth to protect the planet. Just follow the frog” by choosing products that display the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal.

The “Follow the Frog” campaign now encompasses a wide range of marketing content and activities, from print ads, retail promotional materials, Follow the Frog events, and a Frog Blog to alliances with nearly 6,000 companies that display and promote the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal. The campaign has been effective. The initial video quickly captured more than 5 million YouTube views and 32,000 shares, was nominated for a Webby award for online video excellence, and won a TED award as the top Ad Worth Spreading in the social causes category. The overall campaign has increased consumer awareness and boosted the number of companies committing to sourcing from Rainforest Alliance Certified operations, including major brands such as Lipton, Mars, and McDonald’s.

### Always: “Like a Girl”

P&G’s Always feminine hygiene brand is on a mission. Based on research showing that a girl’s confidence plummets at puberty, Always launched a big-budget ad campaign aimed at changing the meaning of doing something “like a girl.” The first “Like a Girl” ad used a reality show format, asking young women, men, boys, and girls to “show me what it looks like to run like a girl” or “fight like a girl” or “throw like a girl.” The women, men, and boys portrayed the classic “feminine” stereotypes. Young girls, however, attacked the tasks with gusto, devoid of any negative connotations. “When did doing something ‘like a girl’ become an insult?” the ad asked. “Always wants to change that.” The ad closed with inspirational images of girls running, throwing, and kicking with skill and confidence. “Let’s make #RunLikeAGirl mean amazing things,” concluded the ad.

When the “Like a Girl” ad ran during Super Bowl XLIX, viewer reaction was nothing short of spectacular. The ad placed first or second in virtually every major ad-rating poll, and it topped all other Super Bowl ads by a wide margin in social media mentions and sharing. Later in the year, “Like a Girl” took home an Emmy for most outstanding commercial and a Grand Prix award for best PR campaign at the Cannes international ad festival. In its first year, “Like a Girl” racked up an amazing 85 million views and more than a billion global impressions.

The Always “Like a Girl” effort has now expanded into a full-blown, ongoing educational and support campaign. “When you have a message that really addresses such an important and a real issue and it’s done in a way that is very consistent with who you are as a brand, I think consumers want to engage with that,” says P&G’s vice president of global feminine care. “We have started an epic battle to show the world that doing things like a girl is downright amazing.”

Much personal selling involves business-to-business trade. In selling to businesses, salespeople may not offer bribes to purchasing agents or others who can influence a sale. They may not obtain or use technical or trade secrets of competitors through bribery or industrial espionage. Finally, salespeople must not disparage competitors or competing products by suggesting things that are not true.

# 14 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review

In this chapter, you learned how companies use integrated marketing communications (IMC) to communicate customer value. Modern marketing calls for more than just creating customer value by developing a good product, pricing it attractively, and making it available to target customers. Companies also must clearly and persuasively engage current and prospective consumers and *communicate* that value to them. To do this, they must blend five promotion mix tools, guided by a well-designed and implemented IMC strategy.

### OBJECTIVE 14-1 Define the five promotion mix tools for communicating customer value. (pp 424–425)

A company’s total *promotion mix*—also called its *marketing communications mix*—consists of the specific blend of *advertising*, *personal selling*, *sales promotion*, *public relations*, and *direct and digital marketing* tools that the company uses to engage consumers, persuasively communicate customer value, and build customer relationships. *Advertising* includes any paid form of nonpersonal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor. In contrast, *public* relations focuses on building good relations with the company’s various publics.
