### Get Your Groupon

Local marketing is an effective tool used by marketers to reach intended market segments. Groupon has capitalized on this concept by tailoring brands and marketing to the needs and wants of local customer segments—cities, neighborhoods, and even specific stores. According to its website, Groupon “offers a vast mobile and online marketplace where people discover and save on amazing things to do, see, eat, and buy. By enabling real-time commerce across local businesses, travel destinations, consumer products, and live events, shoppers can find the best a city has to offer. Groupon is redefining how small businesses attract and retain customers by providing them with customizable and scalable marketing tools and services to profitably grow their businesses.” This concept lies at the heart of Groupon’s mission: “to connect local commerce, increasing consumer buying power while driving more business to local merchants through price and discovery.” To help consumers make those connections, Groupon offers a mobile app, online marketplace, and social media touchpoints where customers can readily access information on its daily deals.

## Marketing Ethics  
### Targeting Teens

Beverage Giant Coca-Cola faces several challenges as a result of an increase of consumer health awareness, the reduction of carbonated drinks in schools in many regions, and newer, healthier drinks. The brand is having an especially difficult time getting through to teens. To increase sales, Coca-Cola attempted to make a personal connection with teens through a campaign called “Share a Coke.” The campaign was first launched in Australia in 2011, then introduced in the United States, and then spread across 70 countries until 2015.

The soda maker also knows very well that it needs to target teens through social media and mobile phones. Through the #sharecoke hashtag, Coca-Cola achieved a phenomenal result, with 25 million extra Facebook followers and an increase of consumption by young consumers by 7 percent in 2015.

However, the campaign was criticized by many; health experts, for instance, expressed their concern that Coca-Cola uses the internet and technology to push sugary drinks on teens that might lead to long-term consequences with regard to their diet and lifestyle.

**7-12** Discuss how Coca-Cola expanded its teen customer base again.

**7-13** How will Coca-Cola prove that they are catering to teens responsibly?

## Marketing by the Numbers  
### USAA

USAA is a financial services company formed in 1922 by 25 Army officers who came together to insure each other’s automobiles because they were deemed too high-risk to insure. USAA now has almost 25,000 employees and more than 9 million member customers. It consistently ranks in the top 10 automobile insurance companies and offers other types of insurance as well as banking, investment, retirement, and financial planning services. USAA practices a niche marketing strategy—it targets only active and former military personnel and their immediate families. Members earn the right to be customers by serving in the military and can pass that on to their spouses and children. The company was originally even more restrictive, targeting only military officers.
