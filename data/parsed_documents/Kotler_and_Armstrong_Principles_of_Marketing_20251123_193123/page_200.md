# Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

Videos detailing Maersk Line’s activities, services, and people. Maersk Line’s Twitter feed presents the latest news and events, creating conversation and buzz with and among its more than 123,000 Twitter followers. The company’s LinkedIn account, with more than 155,500 followers, lets Maersk Line engage customers, opinion leaders, and industry influencers, who share information and discuss industry challenges and opportunities with shipping and logistics experts. Why all this social media? “The goal is to use social media to get closer to our customers,” says Maersk Line.

Compared with traditional media and sales approaches, digital and social media can create greater customer engagement and interaction. B-to-B marketers know that they aren’t really targeting *businesses*, they are targeting *individuals* in those businesses who affect buying decisions. And today’s business buyers are always connected via their digital devices—whether it’s PCs, tablets, or smartphones.

Digital and social media play an important role in engaging these always-connected business buyers in a way that personal selling alone cannot. Instead of the old model of sales reps calling on business customers at work or maybe meeting up with them at trade shows, the new digital approaches facilitate anytime, anywhere connections between a wide range of people in the selling and customer organizations. It gives both sellers and buyers more control of and access to important information. B-to-B marketing has always been social network marketing, but today’s digital environment offers an exciting array of new networking tools and applications.

Some B-to-B companies mistakenly assume that today’s digital and social media are useful primarily to consumer products and services companies. But no matter what the industry, digital platforms can be powerful tools for engaging customers and other important publics. For example, industrial powerhouse GE uses a wide array of digital and social media, not just to engage and support its business customers directly but also to tell the compelling GE brand story more broadly and to keep the company relevant, contemporary, and accessible (see Real Marketing 6.2).

## Institutional and Government Markets

So far, our discussion of organizational buying has focused largely on the buying behavior of business buyers. Much of this discussion also applies to the buying practices of institutional and government organizations. However, these two nonbusiness markets have additional characteristics and needs. In this final section, we address the special features of institutional and government markets.

### Institutional Markets

> **Institutional market**  
> Schools, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other institutions that provide goods and services to people in their care.

The **institutional market** consists of schools, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other institutions that provide goods and services to people in their care. Institutions differ from one another in their sponsors and their objectives. For example, Community Health Systems runs 203 for-profit hospitals in 29 states, generating $18 billion in annual revenues. By contrast, the Shriners Hospitals for Children is a nonprofit organization with 21 facilities that provide free specialized health care for children, whereas the government-run Veterans Affairs Medical Centers located across the country provide special services to veterans. Each institution has different buying needs and resources.

Institutional markets can be huge. Consider the massive and expanding U.S. prisons economy:

> More than 720 out of every 100,000 people in the United States are in prison—that’s 2.2 million people. Criminal correction spending has outpaced budget growth in education, transportation, and public assistance. U.S. prisons spend about $74 billion annually—an average of $31,000 per prisoner—to keep their facilities running, an amount greater than the GDP of 133 nations. The ultimate captive market, it translates into plenty of work for companies looking to break into the prison market. “Our core business touches so many things—security, medicine, education, food service, maintenance, technology—that it presents a unique opportunity for any number of vendors to do business with us,” says an executive at Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison operator in the country.
