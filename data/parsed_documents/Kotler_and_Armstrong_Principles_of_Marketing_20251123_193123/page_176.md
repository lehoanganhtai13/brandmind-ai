# Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

In such cases, consumer behavior does not pass through the usual belief-attitude-behavior sequence. Consumers do not search extensively for information about the brands, evaluate brand characteristics, and make weighty decisions about which brands to buy. Because they are not highly involved with the product, consumers may not evaluate the choice, even after purchase. Thus, the buying process involves brand beliefs formed by passive learning, followed by purchase behavior, which may or may not be followed by evaluation.

Because buyers are not highly committed to any brands, marketers of low-involvement products with few brand differences often use price and sales promotions to promote buying. Alternatively, they can add product features or enhancements to differentiate their brands from the rest of the pack and raise involvement.

For example, take something as seemingly uncomplicated as wheat flour or oatmeal. To set its brand apart, Bob’s Red Mill adds an “honest-to-goodness” touch to all of the baking, grain, and cereal products it makes, using only the best nutritional whole grains and time-honored stone mill production processes. Bob’s Red Mill doesn’t sell just plain old flour. It offers “America’s Best Baking Flours,” nine varieties of differentiated wheat flours, ranging from Unbleached White Fine Pastry Flour and Super-Fine Cake Flour to 100% Whole Grain Organic Ivory Wheat flour. ● The same goes for its oatmeal—billed as the World’s Best Oatmeal—with 24 varieties ranging from Extra Thick Rolled Oats to High Fiber Oat Bran hot cereal to Organic Scottish Oatmeal.

## Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior

Consumers undertake **variety-seeking buying behavior** in situations characterized by low consumer involvement but significant perceived brand differences. In such cases, consumers often do a lot of brand switching. For example, when buying cookies, a consumer may hold some beliefs, choose a cookie brand without much evaluation, and then evaluate that brand during consumption. But the next time, the consumer might pick another brand out of boredom or simply to try something different. Brand switching occurs for the sake of variety rather than because of dissatisfaction.

In such product categories, the marketing strategy may differ for the market leader and minor brands. The market leader will try to encourage habitual buying behavior by dominating shelf space, keeping shelves fully stocked, and running frequent reminder advertising. Challenger firms will encourage variety seeking by offering lower prices, special deals, coupons, free samples, and advertising that presents reasons for trying something new.

> **Author Comment:** The actual purchase decision is part of a much larger buying process—from recognizing a need through postpurchase behavior. Marketers want to be involved throughout the entire buyer decision process.

> The buying process starts long before the actual purchase and continues long after. Therefore, marketers must focus on the entire buying process, not just the purchase decision.

## The Buyer Decision Process

Now that we have looked at the influences that affect buyers, we are ready to look at how consumers make buying decisions. ● **Figure 5.5** shows that the buyer decision process consists of five stages: *need recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives*, the *purchase decision*, and *postpurchase behavior*. Clearly, the buying process starts long before the actual purchase and continues long after. Marketers need to focus on the entire buying process rather than on the purchase decision only.

This table outlines the five key stages of the consumer decision-making process. It begins with **Need recognition**, where a consumer identifies a problem or unmet need. This is followed by **Information search**, where the consumer actively seeks information about potential solutions. Next, **Evaluation of alternatives** involves assessing the various options identified during the search phase based on specific criteria. The process then moves to the **Purchase decision**, where the consumer chooses a product or service. Finally, **Postpurchase behavior** encompasses the consumer's experience after the purchase, including satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and potential repurchase or word-of-mouth communication. This represents a sequential, linear model of consumer behavior, guiding a consumer from initial awareness to post-purchase evaluation.
