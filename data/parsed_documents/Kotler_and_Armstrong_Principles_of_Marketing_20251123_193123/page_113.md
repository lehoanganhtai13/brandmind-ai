# The Persistence of Cultural Values

People in a given society hold many beliefs and values. Their core beliefs and values have a high degree of persistence. For example, most Americans believe in individual freedom, hard work, getting married, and achievement and success. These beliefs shape more specific attitudes and behaviors found in everyday life. *Core* beliefs and values are passed on from parents to children and are reinforced by schools, businesses, religious institutions, and government.

*Secondary* beliefs and values are more open to change. Believing in marriage is a core belief; believing that people should get married early in life is a secondary belief. Marketers have some chance of changing secondary values but little chance of changing core values. For example, family-planning marketers could argue more effectively that people should get married later than not get married at all.

# Shifts in Secondary Cultural Values

Although core values are fairly persistent, cultural swings do take place. Consider the impact of popular music groups, movie personalities, and other celebrities on young people’s hairstyle and clothing norms. Marketers want to predict cultural shifts to spot new opportunities or threats. The major cultural values of a society are expressed in people’s views of themselves and others as well as in their views of organizations, society, nature, and the universe.

## People’s Views of Themselves

People vary in their emphasis on serving themselves versus serving others. Some people seek personal pleasure, wanting fun, change, and escape. Others seek self-realization through religion, recreation, or the avid pursuit of careers or other life goals. Some people see themselves as sharers and joiners; others see themselves as individualists. People use products, brands, and services as a means of self-expression, and they buy products and services that match their views of themselves.

Marketers can position their brands to appeal to specific self-view segments. For example, consider Sperry, maker of storied Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes:^[45]

> Sperry first introduced its iconic Top-Sider shoes in 1935 as the perfect non-slip boat shoe for rough seas and slippery decks. That nautical legacy remains an important part of Sperry’s positioning. The brand’s recent “Odysseys Await” marketing campaign confirms that the sure-footed shoes are built for adventurous soles who can’t stay put. The campaign targets “intrepid consumers”—active millennials who view themselves as adventurous, authentic, bold, and creative. “There’s a certain section of Millennials that really look at life as an opportunity,” says a Sperry marketer. They “want to have meaningful experiences and align with brands that provide opportunities for such.” The “Odysseys Await” campaign reconnects the brand with the sea, featuring intrepid consumers having nautical adventures, jumping off boats, sailing, and diving off cliffs. Headlines such as “The best stories are written with your feet,” “Keep your laces tight and your plans loose,” “Try living for a living,” and “If Earth has an edge, find it” suggest that Sperry Top-Siders are more than just shoes. They are the embodiment of customers’ self-views and lifestyles.

## People’s Views of Others

People’s attitudes toward and interactions with others shift over time. In recent years, some analysts have voiced concerns that the digital age would result in diminished human interaction, as people buried themselves in social media pages or emailed and texted rather than interacting personally. Instead, today’s digital technologies seem to have launched an era of what one trend watcher calls “mass mingling.” Rather than interacting less, people are using social media and mobile communications to connect more than ever. Basically, the more people meet, network, text, and socialize online, the more likely they are to eventually meet up with friends and followers in the real world.

However, these days, even when people are together, they are often “alone together.” Groups of people may sit or walk in their own little bubbles, intensely connected to tiny screens and keyboards. One expert describes the latest communication skill as “maintaining eye contact with someone while you text someone else; it’s hard but it can be done,” she says. “Technology-enabled, we are able to be with one another, and also ‘elsewhere,’ connected to wherever we want to be.”^[46] Thus, whether the new technology-driven People’s views of others: Today’s digital technologies have launched a new era of mass mingling.
