# The Personal Selling Process

The **selling process** consists of several steps that salespeople must master. These steps focus on the goal of getting new customers and obtaining orders from them. However, most salespeople spend much of their time maintaining existing accounts and building long-term customer relationships. We will discuss the relationship aspect of the personal selling process in a later section.

## Steps in the Selling Process

As shown in green dot **Figure 16.3**, the selling process consists of seven steps: prospecting and qualifying, preapproach, approach, presentation and demonstration, handling objections, closing, and follow-up.

### Prospecting and Qualifying

The first step in the selling process is **prospecting**—identifying qualified potential customers. Approaching the right customers is crucial to selling success. Salespeople don’t want to call on just any potential customers. They want to call on those who are most likely to appreciate and respond to the company’s value proposition—those the company can serve well and profitably.

A salesperson must often approach many prospects to get only a few sales. Although the company supplies some leads, salespeople need skill in finding their own. The best source is referrals. Salespeople can ask current customers for referrals and cultivate other referral sources, such as suppliers, dealers, noncompeting salespeople, and online or social media contacts. They can also search for prospects in directories or on the internet and track down leads using the telephone, email, and social media. Or, as a last resort, they can drop in unannounced on various offices (a practice known as *cold calling*).

### Figure 16.3 Steps in the Selling Process

This table outlines a sales process, differentiating between a transaction-oriented approach and one focused on building long-term customer relationships. The transaction-oriented sequence includes prospecting and qualifying leads, the preapproach phase, the initial approach to the customer, and the presentation and demonstration of the product or service. This is followed by handling objections, closing the sale, and finally, a follow-up. In contrast, the overarching goal of building and maintaining profitable customer relationships is presented as a distinct, more encompassing objective, suggesting that the preceding steps, while potentially transactional, should ideally contribute to this broader aim. The structure implies a sequential flow for individual sales interactions, with a superimposed, continuous objective of relationship cultivation.

> …but remember that in the long run, a single sale is only one element of a long-term customer relationship. So the selling process steps must be understood in the broader context of maintaining profitable customer relationships.

Ultimately, social selling technologies are helping to make sales forces more efficient, cost-effective, and productive. The technologies help salespeople do what good salespeople have always done—build customer relationships by solving customer problems—but do it better, faster, and cheaper.

However, social selling also has some drawbacks. For starters, it’s not cheap. But even more, there are some things you just can’t present or teach via the internet—things that require personal engagement and interaction. For these reasons, some high-tech experts recommend that sales executives use online and social media technologies to spot opportunities, provide information, maintain customer contact, and make preliminary client sales presentations but resort to old-fashioned, face-to-face meetings when the time draws near to close a big deal.
