# Table 11.2 | Price Adjustments

This table outlines various pricing strategies, categorized by their approach to price adjustment. Discount and allowance pricing involves reducing prices to incentivize specific customer actions like bulk purchases or early payments. Segmented pricing allows for price variations based on customer differences, product variations, or location. Psychological pricing focuses on adjusting prices for their perceived impact on consumer behavior. Promotional pricing is a tactic of temporary price reductions to boost immediate sales. Geographical pricing specifically modifies prices to reflect customer locations. Dynamic pricing involves continuous price adjustments to match individual customer needs and situational factors. Finally, international pricing addresses the complexities of setting prices in different global markets. These strategies collectively represent a spectrum of methods businesses employ to optimize their pricing in response to market dynamics and customer behavior.

> **Allowance**  
> Promotional money paid by manufacturers to retailers in return for an agreement to feature the manufacturer’s products in some way.

Allowances are another type of reduction from the list price. For example, *trade-in allowances* are price reductions given for turning in an old item when buying a new one. Trade-in allowances are most common in the automobile industry, but they are also given for other durable goods. *Promotional allowances* are payments or price reductions that reward dealers for participating in advertising and sales-support programs.

> **Segmented pricing**  
> Selling a product or service at two or more prices, where the difference in prices is not based on differences in costs.

## Segmented Pricing

Companies will often adjust their basic prices to allow for differences in customers, products, and locations. In **segmented pricing**, the company sells a product or service at two or more prices, even though the difference in prices is not based on differences in costs.

Segmented pricing takes several forms. Under *customer-segment pricing*, different customers pay different prices for the same product or service. For example, museums, movie theaters, and retail stores may charge lower prices for students and senior citizens. Kohl’s offers a 15 percent discount every Wednesday to “customers aged 60 or better.” ● And Walgreens holds periodic Senior Discount Day events, offering 20 percent price reductions to AARP members and to its Balance Rewards members age 55 and over. “Grab Granny and go shopping!” advises one Walgreens ad.

Under *product form pricing*, different versions of the product are priced differently but not according to differences in their costs. For instance, a round-trip economy seat on a flight from New York to London might cost $1,100, whereas a business-class seat on the same flight might cost $3,400 or more. Although business-class customers receive roomier, more comfortable seats and higher-quality food and service, the differences in costs to the airlines are much less than the additional prices to passengers. However, to passengers who can afford it, the additional comfort and services are worth the extra charge.

Using *location-based pricing*, a company charges different prices for different locations, even though the cost of offering each location is the same. For instance, state universities charge higher tuition for out-of-state students, and theaters vary their seat prices because of audience preferences for certain locations. Finally, using *time-based pricing*, a firm varies its price by the season, the month, the day, and even the hour. For example, movie theaters charge matinee pricing during the daytime, and resorts give weekend and seasonal discounts.

For segmented pricing to be an effective strategy, certain conditions must exist. The market must be segmentable, and segments must show different degrees of demand. The costs of segmenting and reaching the market cannot exceed the extra revenue obtained from the price difference. Of course, the segmented pricing must also be legal.
