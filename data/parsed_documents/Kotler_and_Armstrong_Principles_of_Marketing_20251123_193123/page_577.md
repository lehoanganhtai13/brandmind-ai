When the ad drew strong criticism from Russians, Coca-Cola quickly redrew the map to include the disputed territory, saying, “We apologize . . . the map is fixed.” The new map, of course, set off a new flurry of protest in neighboring Ukraine, where lawmakers called for a boycott of Coke. Coca-Cola finally pulled the offending ad altogether.

Business norms and behaviors also vary from country to country. For example, American executives like to get right down to business and engage in fast and tough face-to-face bargaining. However, Japanese and other Asian businesspeople often find this behavior offensive. They prefer to start with polite conversation, and they rarely say no in face-to-face conversations. As another example, firm handshakes are a common and expected greeting in most Western countries; in some Middle Eastern countries, however, handshakes might be refused if offered. Microsoft founder Bill Gates once set off a flurry of international controversy when he shook the hand of South Korea’s president with his right hand while keeping his left hand in his pocket, something that Koreans consider highly disrespectful. In some countries, when being entertained at a meal, not finishing all the food implies that it was somehow substandard. In other countries, in contrast, wolfing down every last bite might be taken as a mild insult, suggesting that the host didn’t supply enough quantity.¹²¹ American business executives need to understand these kinds of cultural nuances before conducting business in another country.

By the same token, companies that understand cultural nuances can use them to their advantage in global markets. For example, when British clothing retailer Marks & Spencer decided to open its first standalone lingerie and beauty store, to the surprise of many it bypassed Paris, London, and New York and instead chose Saudi Arabia. Operating in Saudi Arabia requires some significant but worthwhile cultural adjustments:²²

> The Saudi retail market is booming, and the country has a fast-growing and affluent consumer class. However, the conservative Islamic kingdom has no end of restrictive cultural and religious rules, especially when it involves retailing to women. In Saudi Arabia, women cover themselves in full-length black cloaks—called *abaya*—when they go out in public and must have a male chaperone, usually a relative. However, because they typically wear Western clothes at home or when traveling abroad, Western-style fashion stores are still very popular.

> When selling to Saudi women, Marks & Spencer must adhere to rigorously enforced religious and cultural strictures. For example, by government decree, its lingerie stores must employ an exclusively female sales staff. Because women’s faces can’t be shown and certain public dress is prohibited, Marks & Spencer uses tamer in-store marketing photos and video displays requiring separate photo shoots. Music is forbidden in Saudi malls and stores, so Marks & Spencer has eliminated the usual background compositions. Thanks to these and many other cultural adaptations, Saudi Arabia has become one of Marks & Spencer’s highest-grossing emerging markets, well worth the additional costs of operating there. Marks & Spencer now has six lingerie and beauty stores in Saudi Arabia along with 16 full department stores. It has even gone so far as to use headless female mannequins to display its lingerie. “Unfortunately,” says one Marks & Spencer marketer, “even the mannequins are not allowed to show faces.”

Thus, understanding cultural traditions, preferences, and behaviors can help companies not only avoid embarrassing mistakes but also take advantage of cross-cultural opportunities.

### The Impact of Marketing Strategy on Cultures

Whereas marketers worry about the impact of global cultures on their marketing strategies, others may worry about the impact of marketing strategies on global cultures. For example, social critics contend that large American multinationals, such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Nike, Google, Disney, and Facebook, aren’t just globalizing their brands; they are Americanizing the world’s cultures. Other elements of American culture have become pervasive worldwide. For instance, more people now study English in China than speak it in the United States. If you assemble businesspeople from Brazil, Germany, and China, they’ll likely transact in English.
