In stores, racks once filled with cartons of cigarettes now displayed signs urging customers, “We quit tobacco. Ask a trained pharmacist or [MinuteClinic] nurse practitioner to help you quit, too.” CVS is now poised to become the retailer of choice for those seeking smoking cessation products and services. By the end of the first year, CVS prescriptions for smoking cessation products grew by 63 percent and CVS Smoking Cessation Hubs received nearly one million visits.

Probably more significant, however, CVS’s decision to purge tobacco products gave its reputation a boost, earning new business from non-smoking consumers on the one hand and PBM partners and clients on the other. Although it’s difficult to track benefits from such sources, in the months following the elimination of tobacco from its shelves, revenues from CVS’s pharmacy benefits services rose by 12 percent and the company lined up $11 billion worth of new contracts for its PBM business.

The decision to quit tobacco may have led to another important opportunity for CVS. About a year later, when Target went looking for a partner to buy and operate the pharmacies in 1,700 of its stores, CVS was a natural choice. Target had stopped selling cigarettes and tobacco products almost a decade earlier. CVS’s new image and sense-of-mission strategy fit perfectly with the like-minded “no tobacco” mentality of Target and its customers.

Thus, CVS Health is on a mission. Its genuine concern for “helping people on their path to better health” reaches far beyond just revenues and profits. But as it turns out, doing good and doing well are not at odds. To the contrary, rather than stunting sales, CVS’s lofty mission is driving new growth and profits. No longer just the “drugstore on the corner,” CVS Health is now a $153 billion health-care giant, number 10 among the *Fortune* 500 and the nation’s largest health care–related company. Eighty-five percent of CVS’s revenues now come from health care.

As for that decision to quit tobacco?  
“I cannot think of another example in corporate America where a company sacrificed $2 billion of revenue for what they felt was the right thing to do,” says CVS’s chief marketer. “It’s a stunning thing, [and] it proved out for us in [so many] ways.” For CVS Health, he says, success means “delivering what’s right for people every day in a way that creates economic value for the business.”

# Marketing Ethics and the Sustainable Company

## Marketing Ethics

Good ethics are a cornerstone of sustainable marketing. In the long run, unethical marketing harms customers and society as a whole. Further, it eventually damages a company’s reputation and effectiveness, jeopardizing its very survival. Thus, the sustainable marketing goals of long-term consumer and business welfare can be achieved only through ethical marketing conduct.

Conscientious marketers face many moral dilemmas. The best thing to do is often unclear. Because not all managers have fine moral sensitivity, companies need to develop *corporate marketing ethics policies*—broad guidelines that everyone in the organization must follow. These policies should cover distributor relations, advertising standards, customer service, pricing, product development, and general ethical standards.

The finest guidelines cannot resolve all the difficult ethical situations the marketer faces. **Table 20.1** lists some difficult ethical issues marketers could face during their careers. If marketers choose immediate-sales-producing actions in all of these cases, their marketing behavior might well be described as immoral or even amoral. If they refuse to go along with *any* of the actions, they might be ineffective as marketing managers and unhappy because of the constant moral tension. Managers need a set of principles that will help them figure out the moral importance of each situation and decide how far they can go in good conscience.

But *what* principle should guide companies and marketing managers on issues of ethics and social responsibility? One philosophy is that the free market and the legal system should decide such issues. Under this principle, companies and their managers are not responsible for making moral judgments. Companies can in good conscience do whatever the market and legal systems allow. However, history provides an endless list of examples of company actions that were legal but highly irresponsible.

A second philosophy puts responsibility not on the system but in the hands of individual companies and managers. This more enlightened philosophy suggests that a company should have a social conscience. Companies and managers should apply high standards of ethics and morality when making corporate decisions, regardless of “what the system allows.” Each company and marketing manager must work out a philosophy of socially responsible and ethical behavior.
