# Personal Selling and Sales Promotion

messages. For example, drugstore chain Walgreens makes coupons available to its customers through several mobile channels:25

> Using the Walgreens smartphone app, customers can instantly download coupons ranging in value from 50 cents to $5, good toward anything from health and beauty products to everyday essentials such as diapers. The coupons are conveniently scannable—no clipping or printing required. Customers simply pull up the coupons on the Walgreens app and cashiers scan them straight from the customer’s phone. Walgreens also tweets mobile coupons to customers who check in to any of its 8,100 stores nationwide using check-in apps such as Foursquare, Yelp, or Shopkick. Walgreens has mobile scanning capabilities available at all of its stores, giving it the nation’s largest retail mobile coupon program. Through its mobile app, “Walgreens is using technology to go above and beyond,” says one analyst. “They’re thinking about the customer.”

**Rebates** (or *cash refunds*) are like coupons except that the price reduction occurs after the purchase rather than at the retail outlet. The customer sends proof of purchase to the manufacturer, which then refunds part of the purchase price by mail. For example, Toro ran a clever preseason promotion on some of its snowblower models, offering a rebate if the snowfall in the buyer’s market area turned out to be below average. Competitors were not able to match this offer on such short notice, and the promotion was very successful.

**Price packs** (also called *cents-off deals*) offer consumers savings off the regular price of a product. The producer marks the reduced prices directly on the label or package. Price packs can be single packages sold at a reduced price (such as two for the price of one) or two related products banded together (such as a toothbrush and toothpaste). Price packs are very effective—even more so than coupons—in stimulating short-term sales.

**Premiums** are goods offered either free or at low cost as an incentive to buy a product, ranging from toys included with kids’ products to phone cards and DVDs. A premium may come inside the package (in-pack), outside the package (on-pack), or through the mail. For example, over the years, McDonald’s has offered a variety of premiums in its Happy Meals—from *My Little Pony* characters to Beanie Boos and LEGO hologram drink cups. Customers can visit www.happymeal.com to play games, read e-books, and watch commercials associated with the current Happy Meal sponsor.26

**Advertising specialties**, also called *promotional products*, are useful articles imprinted with an advertiser’s name, logo, or message that are given as gifts to consumers. Typical items include T-shirts and other apparel, pens, coffee mugs, calendars, key rings, tote bags, coolers, golf balls, and caps. U.S. marketers spent more than $20 billion on advertising specialties last year. Such items can be very effective. The “best of them stick around for months, subtly burning a brand name into a user’s brain,” notes a promotional products expert.27

**Point-of-purchase (POP) promotions** include displays and demonstrations that take place at the point of sale. Think of your last visit to the local Costco, Walmart, or Bed Bath & Beyond. Chances are good that you were tripping over aisle displays, promotional signs, “shelf talkers,” or demonstrators offering free tastes of featured food products. Unfortunately, many retailers do not like to handle the hundreds of displays, signs, and posters they receive from manufacturers each year. Manufacturers have therefore responded by offering better POP materials, offering to set them up, and tying them in with television, print, or online messages.

**Contests, sweepstakes, and games** give consumers the chance to win something, such as cash, trips, or goods, by luck or through extra effort. A *contest* calls for consumers to submit an entry—a jingle, guess, suggestion—to be judged by a panel that will select the best entries. A *sweepstakes* calls for consumers to submit their names for a drawing. A *game* presents consumers with something—bingo numbers, missing letters—every time they buy, which may or may not help them win a prize.

All kinds of companies use sweepstakes and contests to create brand attention and boost consumer involvement. For example, Google’s “Doodle 4 Google” contest invited kids to design a Google logo based on the theme “If I could invent one thing to make the world a better place…,” with prizes ranging from T-shirts and tablets to a $30,000 college scholarship. Kellogg’s Eggo brand hosted a Great Eggo Waffle Off! contest on Facebook, with entrants submitting their best recipes for waffles—winners received $5,000. And Dove ran a “Real Beauty Should Be Shared” contest asking its Facebook fans to name a friend and say why that friend “represents Real Beauty.” The winners became the next faces of Dove.
