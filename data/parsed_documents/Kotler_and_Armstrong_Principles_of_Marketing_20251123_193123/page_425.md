# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This table outlines learning objectives related to marketing communications, structured as a progression from foundational concepts to practical application. It begins with defining the five core promotion mix tools, establishing the basic components of customer communication. Subsequently, it addresses the evolving communication environment and the critical importance of integrated marketing communications. The objectives then delve into the process of developing effective marketing communications, detailing the necessary steps. Finally, the table covers the strategic aspects of setting the overall promotion budget and the factors influencing the design of the promotion mix itself, concluding with a comprehensive overview of promotional strategy.
Despite its diversity, no matter what the platform—whether print or packaging or TV, laptop, and mobile screens or something else—the Snickers campaign is much more than just a scattered collection of clever content. What makes the campaign so powerful is that all its pieces are carefully integrated under the brand’s “Snickers satisfies” and “You’re not you when you’re hungry” positioning. The message strikes a core human emotion—that you’re likely to get a little out of sorts when you haven’t eaten for a while—in an engaging and memorable way. No matter where you are in the world or how you receive the message, the campaign delivers a clear and consistent brand message.

Thus, after more than six years, the popular Snickers “You’re not you” campaign is still packing energy. Prior to the campaign, Snickers was losing market share. However, not long after Betty White made her Super Bowl debut, Snickers surpassed Mars’s own M&Ms to become the planet’s best-selling candy, a position it still holds today. With an expanded lineup that now includes Snickers Almond, Snickers Peanut Butter Squared, Snickers Bites, and Snickers Ice Cream bars, the $3.5 billion Snickers brand now contributes more than 10 percent of giant Mars, Inc.’s total annual revenues. Thanks in large part to the innovative “You’re not you when you’re hungry” integrated marketing communications campaign, the brand’s long-standing claim holds truer than ever for both the company and its customers: “Snickers satisfies.”¹

### BUILDING GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS

Building good customer relationships calls for more than just developing a good product, pricing it attractively, and making it available to target customers. Companies must also *engage* consumers and *communicate* their value propositions to customers, and what they communicate should not be left to chance. All communications must be planned and blended into carefully integrated programs. Just as good communication is important in building and maintaining any other kind of relationship, it is a crucial element in a company’s efforts to engage customers and build profitable customer relationships.
