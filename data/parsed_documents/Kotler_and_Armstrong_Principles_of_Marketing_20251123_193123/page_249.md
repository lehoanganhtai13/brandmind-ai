# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

*Capital items* are industrial products that aid in the buyer’s production or operations, including installations and accessory equipment. Installations consist of major purchases such as buildings (factories, offices) and fixed equipment (generators, drill presses, large computer systems, elevators). Accessory equipment includes portable factory equipment and tools (hand tools, lift trucks) and office equipment (computers, fax machines, desks). These types of equipment have shorter lives than do installations and simply aid in the production process.

The final group of industrial products is *supplies and services*. Supplies include operating supplies (lubricants, coal, paper, pencils) and repair and maintenance items (paint, nails, brooms). Supplies are the convenience products of the industrial field because they are usually purchased with a minimum of effort or comparison. Business services include maintenance and repair services (window cleaning, computer repair) and business advisory services (legal, management consulting, advertising). Such services are usually supplied under contract.

## Organizations, Persons, Places, and Ideas

In addition to tangible products and services, marketers have broadened the concept of a product to include other market offerings: organizations, persons, places, and ideas.

Organizations often carry out activities to “sell” the organization itself. *Organization marketing* consists of activities undertaken to create, maintain, or change the attitudes and behavior of target consumers toward an organization. Both profit and not-for-profit organizations practice organization marketing.

Business firms sponsor public relations or *corporate image marketing* campaigns to market themselves and polish their images. For example, as noted in Chapter 6, GE’s long-running “Imagination at Work” campaign markets the industrial giant as a company whose imaginative products and technologies are making a difference in the world.  
🔵 Consider one recent award-winning TV spot, called “Childlike Imagination.” The whimsical ad brings GE’s products—  
from jet engines and diesel locomotives to giant wind turbines and hospital diagnostics machines—to life through the eyes of a wide-eyed young girl whose mom works at GE. GE is “Building, powering, moving, and curing the world,” says the company. “Not just imagining. Doing. GE works.”³

People can also be thought of as products. *Person marketing* consists of activities undertaken to create, maintain, or change attitudes or behavior toward particular people. People ranging from presidents, entertainers, and sports figures to professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and architects use person marketing to build their reputations. And businesses, charities, and other organizations use well-known personalities to help sell their products or causes. For example, Nike spends almost $1 billion annually on endorsement deals with a stable of stars spanning almost every conceivable sport worldwide, including headliners such as tennis greats Maria Sharapova and Rodger Federer, world soccer superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, and current and former NBA all-stars Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.⁴

*Place marketing* involves activities undertaken to create, maintain, or change attitudes or behavior toward particular places. Cities, states, regions, and even entire nations compete to attract tourists, new residents, conventions, and company offices and factories. The New Orleans city website shouts “Go NOLA” and markets annual events such as Mardi Gras festivities and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Tourism Australia advertises that “There’s Nothing Like Australia” and provides a website and smartphone app complete with videos, holiday ideas, destination information, and about anything else travelers might need to plan an Australian vacation.⁵

*Ideas* can also be marketed. In one sense, all marketing is the marketing of an idea, whether it is the general idea of brushing your teeth or the specific idea that Crest toothpastes
