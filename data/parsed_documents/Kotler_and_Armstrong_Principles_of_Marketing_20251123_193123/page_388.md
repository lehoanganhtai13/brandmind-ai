# Company Case Apple Pay: Taking Mobile Payments Mainstream

After leaving his office in Manhattan, Tag stopped at a nearby Panera to grab a Frontega Chicken Panini and Green Passion Power Smoothie as a quick dinner on his way to see some friends in Soho. Upon ordering, he held his Apple Watch to the contactless reader near the register, gently pressed his finger to the TouchID fingerprint sensor on the small screen, and let Apple Pay do the rest.

Wanting to get across town as soon as possible, Tag used his Uber app to summon an UberX car. During the car ride, he remembered that he needed a couple of new dress shirts. With a few quick clicks on his watch, he selected the shirts through his Macy’s app. With a simple tap, he used Apple Pay to seamlessly complete the transaction. As he neared his destination, Tag added a tip to the bill for the ride through the Uber app, which he’d already configured to use Apple Pay as the default. With one simple press of his finger to TouchID on his watch, he exited the cab.

Three purchases—offline, online, and, well, sort of in between—no wallet required. No traditional wallet, that is. This new reality—one that many early adopters are already living—is rapidly expanding toward what some experts predict will become the future for everyone. Folks like Tag don’t even carry traditional wallets anymore, only their mobile devices and perhaps an ID and a backup credit card for retailers that don’t accept mobile payments—yet. After years of predictions that mobile payments would replace cash and credit cards, there are finally signs that it might actually be happening. And Apple is leading the way.

## Hardly New

The ability to pay for transactions with a mobile device is hardly new. In fact, the first technology for mobile payments was invented by Sony way back in 1989. It was first put into use in Hong Kong’s subway system in 1997 and began taking root in Japan in 2001. The tech-savvy Japanese warmed to the idea quickly, and mobile wallet apps were being used on mobile phones throughout Japan by 2004. Ever since, more than 245 million Japanese mobile phones have been equipped with the capability to make mobile payments, and Japanese consumers use mobile payments for everything from transportation to food and household purchases.

So it seems odd that a similar system has not taken root in the United States, although it has not been for lack of trying. Companies have been experimenting with different approaches for years. PayPal was the first to take advantage of the smartphone revolution by creating a payment app that gave just about every smartphone the potential for mobile payments. About a year later, Google entered the mobile payment game with the launch of Google Wallet. In the past six years, numerous other companies—from small start-ups to retailing giants—have tried to gain market acceptance in mobile payments. They include the likes of Samsung, Square, and CurrentC—a failed mobile wallet app backed by Walmart and a consortium of U.S. retailers in hopes of cutting credit card companies and their fees out of the buying loop.

But none of these players—individually or together—has made much of a dent in replacing traditional credit cards and cash as a form of payment in the multitrillion-dollar U.S. retail market. Although the mobile payments concept may seem like a no-brainer for convenience-loving American consumers, numerous barriers on both the buyer and seller sides have kept the concept from gaining momentum. Late to the game with Apple Pay, Apple is clearly a market follower. But it’s a feat that the innovative company has performed to perfection time and again—take a new technology, make it better than any of the initial offerings, then watch the market explode as the Apple version becomes the runaway market leader.

## Overcoming Negative Consumer Perceptions

As with every new technology that involves paying for things, consumers have concerns about the security of mobile payments. PayPal, Google, and the others took significant measures to design secure systems. However, most consumers just weren’t comfortable with the idea that their phone might be used as a portal to their credit cards and bank accounts if it fell into the wrong hands. Never mind that the same could be said of a wallet or handbag, “devices” that are far less secure.

Recognizing consumer reluctance to place digital versions of their financial devices in one app, Apple took security to a higher level. Requiring a fingerprint makes the process much more secure than the more common safeguard of entering a passcode. And if a mobile device is ever lost or stolen, the owner can use its Find My iPhone feature to immediately lock down Apple Pay or even wipe the device completely clean.

Additionally, every compatible Apple device is assigned a unique device account number. This is encrypted and securely stored in a dedicated security chip on the device. It and a transaction-specific security code are the only numbers that Apple transmits to merchants. In fact, the merchant doesn’t even need to know the customer’s name. Credit and debit card numbers are stored only on the local device, not on Apple servers. This makes Apple Pay even more secure and more private than paying by credit card.

Beyond consumer security concerns, previous adoption of mobile payment apps has been slowed by perceptions of a clunky user experience. If convenience is the biggest draw for consumers, then anything more arduous than the already-convenient swipe of a credit card simply won’t cut it. Setting up any of the existing mobile payment apps takes time and effort. Using such apps at the point of purchase is far from seamless, especially if the technology isn’t working quite right. “I don’t want to be that guy holding up the line while we fumble around to get it all to work,” says one business columnist, “just like I don’t want to be the guy who holds up the line boarding an airplane.” because his mobile boarding pass can’t be read.” Mobile apps that hit the market prior to Apple Pay required entering a passcode and—in some cases—hitting multiple buttons.
