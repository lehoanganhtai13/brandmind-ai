(1) It should suggest something about the product’s benefits and qualities: Beautyrest, Slimfast, Snapchat, Pinterest.  
(2) It should be easy to pronounce, recognize, and remember: iPad, Tide, Jelly Belly, Twitter, JetBlue.  
(3) The brand name should be distinctive: Panera, Swiffer, Zappos, Nest.  
(4) It should be extendable—Amazon.com began as an online bookseller but chose a name that would allow expansion into other categories.  
(5) The name should translate easily into foreign languages. The official name of Microsoft’s Bing search engine in China is *bi ying*, which literally means “very certain to respond” in Chinese.  
(6) It should be capable of registration and legal protection. A brand name cannot be registered if it infringes on existing brand names.

Choosing a new brand name is hard work. After a decade of choosing quirky names (Yahoo!, Google) or trademark-proof made-up names (Novartis, Aventis, Accenture), today’s style is to build brands around names that have real meaning. For example, names like Silk (soy milk), Method (home products), Smartwater (beverages), and Snapchat (photo messaging app) are simple and make intuitive sense. But with trademark applications soaring, *available* new names can be hard to find. Try it yourself. Pick a product and see if you can come up with a better name for it. How about Moonshot? Tickle? Vanilla? Treehugger? Simplicity? Mindbender? Google them and you’ll find that they are already taken.

Once chosen, the brand name must be protected. Many firms try to build a brand name that will eventually become identified with the product category. Brand names such as Kleenex, JELL-O, BAND-AID, Scotch Tape, Velcro, Formica, Magic Marker, Post-it Notes, and Ziploc have succeeded in this way. However, their very success may threaten the company’s rights to the name. Many originally protected brand names—such as cellophane, aspirin, nylon, kerosene, linoleum, yo-yo, trampoline, escalator, thermos, and shredded wheat—are now generic names that any seller can use.

To protect their brands, marketers present them carefully using the word *brand* and the registered trademark symbol, as in “BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages.” Even the long-standing “I am stuck on BAND-AID ’cause BAND-AID’s stuck on me” jingle has now become “I am stuck on BAND-AID brand ’cause BAND-AID’s stuck on me.”  
🔵 Similarly, a recent Kleenex ad advises advertisers and others that the name Kleenex should always be followed by the registered trademark symbol and the words “Brand Tissue.” “You may not realize it, but by using the name Kleenex ® as a generic term for tissue,” says the ad, “you risk erasing our coveted brand name that we’ve worked so hard for all these years.”

Companies often go to great lengths to protect their names and brand symbols. For example, insurance company Travelers zealously pursues companies that infringe in even the slightest way on its familiar trademarked red umbrella symbol. It recently threatened a tiny consulting firm in Anchorage, Alaska—Human Resource Umbrella—with legal action for hanging an umbrella above the two l’s in its name. Such actions might seem unneeded, but they are serious business to Travelers. “Mary Poppins might want to consider lawyering up,” quips one industry lawyer.³³

## Brand Sponsorship

A manufacturer has four sponsorship options. The product may be launched as a *national brand* (or *manufacturer’s brand*), as when Samsung and Kellogg sell their output under their own brand names (the Samsung Galaxy tablet or Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes). Or the manufacturer may sell to resellers who give the product a *private brand* (also called a *store brand*). Although most manufacturers create their own brand names, others market licensed brands. Finally, two companies can join forces and *co-brand* a product. We discuss each of these options in turn.

### National Brands versus Store Brands

National brands (or manufacturers’ brands) have long dominated the retail scene. In recent times, however, increasing numbers of retailers and wholesalers have created their own **store brands** (or **private brands**). Store brands have been gaining strength for more than two decades, but recent tighter economic times have created a store-brand boom. Studies show that consumers are now buying even
