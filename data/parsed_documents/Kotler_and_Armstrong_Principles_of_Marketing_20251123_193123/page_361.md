# How Channel Members Add Value

Why do producers give some of the selling job to channel partners? After all, doing so means giving up some control over how and to whom they sell their products. Producers use intermediaries because they create greater efficiency in making goods available to target markets. Through their contacts, experience, specialization, and scale of operation, intermediaries usually offer the firm more than it can achieve on its own.

**Figure 12.1** shows how using intermediaries can provide economies. Figure 12.1A shows three manufacturers, each using direct marketing to reach three customers. This system requires nine different contacts. Figure 12.1B shows the three manufacturers working through one distributor, which contacts the three customers. This system requires only six contacts. In this way, intermediaries reduce the amount of work that must be done by both producers and consumers.

From the economic system’s point of view, the role of marketing intermediaries is to transform the assortments of products made by producers into the assortments wanted by consumers. Producers make narrow assortments of products in large quantities, but consumers want broad assortments of products in small quantities. Marketing channel members buy large quantities from many producers and break them down into the smaller quantities and broader assortments desired by consumers.

For example, Unilever makes millions of bars of Lever 2000 hand soap each week. However, you most likely want to buy only a few bars at a time. Therefore, big food, drug, and discount retailers, such as Safeway, Walgreens, and Target, buy Lever 2000 by the truckload and stock it on their stores’ shelves. In turn, you can buy a single bar of Lever 2000 along with a shopping cart full of small quantities of toothpaste, shampoo, and other related products as you need them. Thus, intermediaries play an important role in matching supply and demand.

In making products and services available to consumers, channel members add value by bridging the major time, place, and possession gaps that separate goods and services from those who use them. Members of the marketing channel perform many key functions. Some help to complete transactions:

* *Information.* Gathering and distributing information about consumers, producers, and other actors and forces in the marketing environment needed for planning and aiding exchange.
* *Promotion.* Developing and spreading persuasive communications about an offer.
* *Contact.* Finding and engaging customers and prospective buyers.
* *Matching.* Shaping offers to meet the buyer’s needs, including activities such as manufacturing, grading, assembling, and packaging.
* *Negotiation.* Reaching an agreement on price and other terms so that ownership or possession can be transferred.

Others help to fulfill the completed transactions:

* *Physical distribution.* Transporting and storing goods.
* *Financing.* Acquiring and using funds to cover the costs of the channel work.
* *Risk taking.* Assuming the risks of carrying out the channel work.

**How a Distributor Reduces the Number of Channel Transactions**

> Marketing channel intermediaries make buying a lot easier for consumers. Again, think about life without grocery retailers. How would you go about buying that 12-pack of Coke or any of the hundreds of other items that you now routinely drop into your shopping cart?

This diagram illustrates two distinct pathways for product distribution originating from a manufacturer. Pathway A depicts direct contact with customers, showing a manufacturer interacting with customers numbered 1 through 9, with some instances of direct manufacturer-to-customer sales (indicated by the arrow). Pathway B, in contrast, details a distribution model involving intermediaries. Here, a manufacturer also interacts with customers numbered 1 through 6, but these interactions are mediated by a distributor. Specifically, manufacturer 1 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 2. Manufacturer 2 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 3. Manufacturer 4 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 4, and so on, up to manufacturer 6. Manufacturers 7, 8, and 9 are shown with direct arrows, implying potential direct contact or an incomplete representation of their distribution channels within this specific comparison. The structure highlights a comparative analysis of direct versus indirect (distributor-mediated) sales channels. The question is not *whether* these functions need to be performed—they must be—but rather *who* will perform them.
