Entrepreneurial marketing: Boston Beer Company founder Jim Koch first marketed his Samuel Adams beer by carrying bottles in a suitcase from bar to bar, telling his story, educating consumers, getting people to taste the beer, and persuading bartenders to carry it.

In fact, approaches to marketing strategy and practice often pass through three stages—entrepreneurial marketing, formulated marketing, and intrapreneurial marketing:

* **Entrepreneurial marketing.** Most companies are started by individuals who live by their wits. They visualize an opportunity, construct flexible strategies on the backs of envelopes, and knock on every door to gain attention.  
  ● Jim Koch, founder of Boston Beer Company, whose Samuel Adams Boston Lager beer has become the top-selling craft beer in America, started out in 1984 brewing a cherished family beer recipe in his kitchen. For marketing, Koch carried bottles of Samuel Adams in a suitcase from bar to bar, telling his story, educating consumers about brewing quality and ingredients, getting people to taste the beer, and persuading bartenders to carry it. For 10 years, he couldn’t afford advertising; he sold his beer through direct selling and grassroots public relations. “It was all guerrilla marketing,” says Koch. “The big guys were so big, we had to do innovative things like that.” Today, however, his business pulls in more than $1 billion a year, making it the leader over more than 1,000 competitors in the craft brewery market.⁹

* **Formulated marketing.** As small companies achieve success, they inevitably move toward more-formulated marketing. They develop formal marketing strategies and adhere to them closely. Boston Beer now employs a large sales force and has a marketing department that carries out market research and plans strategy. Although Boston Beer is far less formal and sophisticated in its strategy than $43-billion mega-competitor Anheuser-Busch Inbev, it has adopted some of the tools used in professionally run marketing companies.

* **Intrapreneurial marketing.** Many large and mature companies get stuck in formulated marketing. They pore over the latest Nielsen numbers, scan market research reports, and try to fine-tune their competitive strategies and programs. These companies sometimes lose the marketing creativity and passion they had at the start. They now need to build more marketing initiative and “intrapreneurship”—encouraging employees to be more entrepreneurial within the larger corporation—recapturing some of the spirit and action that made them successful in the first place.

Some companies build intrapreneurship into their core marketing operations. For example, IBM encourages employees at all levels to interact on their own with customers through blogs, social media, and other platforms. Google’s Innovation Time-Off program encourages all of its engineers and developers to spend 20 percent of their time developing “cool and wacky” new product ideas—blockbusters such as Google News, Gmail, Google Maps, and AdSense are just a few of the resulting products. And Facebook sponsors regular “hackathons,” during which it encourages internal teams to come up with and present intrapreneurial ideas. One of the most important innovations in the company’s history—the “Like button”—resulted from such a hackathon.¹⁰

The bottom line is that there are many approaches to developing effective competitive marketing strategies. There will be a constant tension between the formulated side of marketing and the creative side. It is easier to learn the formulated side of marketing, which has occupied most of our attention in this book. But we have also seen how marketing creativity and passion in the strategies of many of the companies studied—whether small or large, new or mature—have helped to build and maintain success in the marketplace. With this in mind, we now look at the broad competitive marketing strategies companies can use.

## Basic Competitive Strategies

More than three decades ago, Michael Porter suggested four basic competitive positioning strategies that companies can follow—three winning strategies and one losing one.¹¹ The three winning strategies are as follows:

* **Overall cost leadership.** Here the company works hard to achieve the lowest production and distribution costs. Low costs let the company price lower than its competitors and * win a large market share.
