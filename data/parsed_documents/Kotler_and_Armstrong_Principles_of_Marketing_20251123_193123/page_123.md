# 4 Managing Marketing Information  
## to Gain Customer Insights

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

In this chapter, we continue our exploration of how marketers gain insights into consumers and the marketplace. We look at how companies develop and manage information about important marketplace elements: customers, competitors, products, and marketing programs. To succeed in today’s marketplace, companies must know how to turn mountains of marketing information into fresh customer insights that will help them engage customers and deliver greater value to them.

Let’s start with a story about marketing research and customer insights in action. In order to tailor its products to the market it operates in, Italian chocolate and confectionary manufacturer Ferrero derives fresh insights on customers and the marketplace from marketing information. The company’s ability to use this information and capitalize on them by improving decision making and tailoring their offerings to the local market has been a key success factor in major and growing markets such as India.

## FERRERO: Managing Marketing Information and Customer Insights

Ferrero SpA is an Italian manufacturer of branded chocolate and confectionery products, and the third biggest chocolate producer and confectionery company in the world. It was founded in 1946 in Alba, Italy, by Pietro Ferrero and is still privately owned by the Ferrero family. In the updated listings for the year 2016, Ferrero was named the most reputable company in the food-and-beverages sector in Reputation Institute’s Global RepTrak 100, which ranks the world’s most reputable companies on innovation, governance, and citizenship. Its revenue in the fiscal year of 2015 was $9.9 billion, a 12 percent rise from the previous year. The company employs nearly 33,219 people worldwide. Because of its consistent commitment to innovation and customer focus, the company has outperformed its competitors in many markets.

The firm concentrates on meeting high standards; thus, it manufactures only in places where it is sure it can deliver consistently and establish a secure retail supply chain. The company strives to understand market preferences and has a proven track record of successfully managing marketing information and gaining customer insights. A prime example of this is when it created a new market for premium chocolate in India with the help of sophisticated marketing analysis.

> Ferrero successfully analyzes and uses marketing information and customer insights to better tailor its offerings to the local market. Its ability to gain fresh understandings of customers and the marketplace from marketing information has become the basis for the company’s success.

When Ferrero entered India in 2004, the country did not really have a ready market for premium chocolates. Since India is a very price-sensitive country, most brands offer products at low prices in small packs. Market leader Cadbury had been selling its flagship brand, Dairy Milk, at an entry price of $0.07 for over a decade. That has changed today due to Ferrero’s sophisticated and ongoing analysis of the local market and its customers that paved the way for a new product segment in that region. Premium chocolates now make up about 27 percent of the market in India. Besides Ferrero, several companies compete in this segment, including Cadbury, Nestlé, Mars, Hershey, and Lindt. Cadbury, with its Celebrations, Bournville, and Silk brands, is the market leader, with more than 60 percent share in the premium segment and 70 percent overall.

Within just a decade, Ferrero has garnered a 6 percent share of the Indian chocolate market. More notably, it is credited with developing the premium segment. When Ferrero launched its Rocher chocolates, the only competing brand was Cadbury Celebrations, which was priced between $1.50 and $2.65 per box.
