# Channel Behavior and Organization

They are behavioral systems consisting of real companies and people who interact to accomplish their individual and collective goals. Like groups of people, sometimes they work well together and sometimes they don’t.

Distribution channels are more than simple collections of firms tied together by various flows. They are complex behavioral systems in which people and companies interact to accomplish individual, company, and channel goals. Some channel systems consist of only informal interactions among loosely organized firms. Others consist of formal interactions guided by strong organizational structures. Moreover, channel systems do not stand still—new types of intermediaries emerge and whole new channel systems evolve. Here we look at channel behavior and how members organize to do the work of the channel.

## Channel Behavior

A marketing channel consists of firms that have partnered for their common good. Each channel member depends on the others. For example, a Ford dealer depends on Ford to design cars that meet customer needs. In turn, Ford depends on the dealer to engage customers, persuade them to buy Ford cars, and service the cars after the sale. Each Ford dealer also depends on other dealers to provide good sales and service that will uphold the brand’s reputation. In fact, the success of individual Ford dealers depends on how well the entire Ford marketing channel competes with the channels of Toyota, GM, Honda, and other auto manufacturers.

Each channel member plays a specialized role in the channel. For example, Samsung’s role is to produce electronics products that consumers will covet and create demand through national advertising. Best Buy’s role is to display these Samsung products in convenient locations, answer buyers’ questions, and complete sales. The channel will be most effective when each member assumes the tasks it can do best.

Ideally, because the success of individual channel members depends on the overall channel’s success, all channel firms should work together smoothly. They should understand and accept their roles, coordinate their activities, and cooperate to attain overall channel goals. However, individual channel members rarely take such a broad view. Cooperating to achieve overall channel goals sometimes means giving up individual company goals. Although channel members depend on one another, they often act alone in their own short-run best interests. They often disagree on who should do what and for what rewards. Such disagreements over goals, roles, and rewards generate **channel conflict**.

**Horizontal conflict** occurs among firms at the same level of the channel. For instance, some Ford dealers in Chicago might complain that other dealers in the city steal sales from them by pricing too low or advertising outside their assigned territories. Or Holiday Inn franchisees might complain about other Holiday Inn operators overcharging guests or giving poor service, hurting the overall Holiday Inn image.

**Vertical conflict**, conflict between different levels of the same channel, is even more common. For example, McDonald’s has recently faced growing conflict with its corps of 3,100 independent franchisees:

> Recent surveys of McDonald’s franchise owners have reflected substantial franchisee discontent with the corporation. Some of the conflict has stemmed from a slowdown in system-wide sales in recent years that put both sides on edge. The most basic conflicts are financial. McDonald’s makes its money from franchisee royalties based on total system sales. In contrast, franchisees make money on margins—what’s left over after their costs. To reverse slumping sales, McDonald’s increased its emphasis on aggressive discounting, a strategy that increases corporate sales but squeezes franchisee profits. Franchisees also grumble about adding popular but more complex menu items—such as customizable burgers, McCafe beverages, and all-day breakfasts—that increase the top-line growth for McDonald’s but add preparation, equipment, and staffing costs for franchisees while slowing down service. McDonald’s has also asked franchisees to make costly restaurant upgrades and overhauls. In all, despite recently rebounding sales, franchisees remain disgruntled. The most recent survey rates McDonald’s current franchisee relations at an all-time low 1.81 out of a possible 5, in the “fair” to “poor” range. That’s worrisome for McDonald’s, whose franchise owners operate 90 percent of its locations. Studies show that there’s a huge connection between franchisee satisfaction and customer service.

Some conflict in the channel takes the form of healthy competition. Such competition can be good for the channel; without it, the channel could become passive and

Channel conflict: A high level of franchisee discontent is worrisome to McDonald’s. Franchisees operate more than 90 percent of the chain’s restaurants, and there’s a huge connection between franchisee satisfaction and customer service.
