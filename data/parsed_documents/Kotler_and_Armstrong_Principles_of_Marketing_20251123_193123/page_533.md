Beyond irritating consumers, some direct marketers have been accused of taking unfair advantage of impulsive or less-sophisticated buyers. Television shopping channels, enticing websites, and program-long infomercials targeting television-addicted shoppers seem to be the worst culprits. They feature smooth-talking hosts, elaborately staged demonstrations, claims of drastic price reductions, “while they last” time limitations, and unequaled ease of purchase to inflame buyers who have low sales resistance.

Fraudulent schemes, such as investment scams or phony collections for charity, have also multiplied in recent years. **Internet fraud**, including identity theft and financial scams, has become a serious problem.

YES

According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, since 2005, internet scam complaints have more than tripled to almost 275,000 per year. Last year, the monetary loss of scam complaints exceeded $800 million.⁴⁷

One common form of internet fraud is *phishing*, a type of identity theft that uses deceptive emails and fraudulent online sites to fool users into divulging their personal data. For example, consumers may receive an email, supposedly from their bank or credit card company, saying that their account’s security has been compromised. The sender asks them to log on to a provided web address and confirm their account number, password, and perhaps even their Social Security number. If they follow the instructions, users are actually turning this sensitive information over to scam artists. Although many consumers are now aware of such schemes, phishing can be extremely costly to those caught in the net. It also damages the brand identities of legitimate online marketers who have worked to build user confidence in web, email, and other digital transactions.

Many consumers also worry about *online and digital security*. They fear that unscrupulous snoopers will eavesdrop on their online transactions and social media postings, picking up personal information or intercepting credit and debit card numbers. Although online shopping is now commonplace, one recent study indicated that 70 percent of participants were still concerned about identity theft. Such concerns are often justified in this age of mass consumer data breaches by organizations ranging from retailers, telecommunications services, and banks to health-care providers and the government. According to one source, there were 781 major data security breaches in the United States last year alone.⁴⁸

Another internet marketing concern is that of *access by vulnerable or unauthorized groups*. For example, marketers of adult-oriented materials and sites have found it difficult to restrict access by minors. Although Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, and other social networks allow no children under age 13 to have profiles, all have significant numbers of underage users. Young social media users can be especially vulnerable to identity theft schemes, revealing personal information, negative experiences, and other online dangers. Concerned state and national lawmakers are currently debating bills that would help better protect children online. Unfortunately, this requires the development of technology solutions, and as Facebook puts it, “That’s not so easy.”⁴⁹

## Consumer Privacy

Invasion of privacy is perhaps the toughest public policy issue now confronting the direct marketing industry. Consumers often benefit from database marketing; they receive more offers that are closely matched to their interests. However, many critics worry that marketers may know *too much* about consumers’ lives and that they may use this knowledge to take unfair advantage of consumers. At some point, they claim, the extensive use of databases intrudes on consumer privacy. Consumers, too, worry about their privacy. Although they are now much more willing to share personal information and preferences with marketers via digital and social media, they are still nervous about it. One recent survey found that 92 percent of U.S. internet users worry about their privacy online. Another found that more than 90 percent of Americans feel they have lost control over the collection and use by companies of their personal data and information they share on social media sites.⁵⁰

In these days of “big data,” it seems that almost every time consumers post something on social media or send a tweet, visit a website, enter a sweepstakes, apply for a credit card, or order products by phone or online, their names are entered into some company’s already bulging database.
