# Managing Marketing Information to Gain Customer Insights

However, using its powerful database, Netflix was able to predict accurately which and how many existing members would watch the new *House of Cards* regularly and how many new members would sign up because of the show. Netflix also used its viewer knowledge to pinpoint and personalize promotion of the exclusive series to just the right members. Before *House of Cards* premiered, based on their profiles, selected subscribers saw one of 10 different trailers of the show aimed at their specific likes and interests.

Thanks to Netflix’s big data and marketing analytics prowess, *House of Cards* was a smash hit. It brought in 3 million new subscribers in only the first three months. These new subscribers alone covered almost all of the $100 million investment. More important, a Netflix survey revealed that for the average *House of Cards* viewer, 86 percent were less likely to cancel because of the new program. Such success came as no surprise to Netflix. Its data had predicted that the program would be a hit before the director ever shouted “action.”

Based on the success of *House of Cards*, Netflix has developed a number of other original series, including *Hemlock Grove*, *Lillyhammer*, *Orange Is the New Black*, *Bad Samaritans*, *Marco Polo*, and the animated series *BoJack Horseman*. For traditional broadcast networks, the average success rate for new television shows is 35 percent. In contrast, Netflix is batting almost 70 percent. To continue the momentum, Netflix committed to spending a dazzling $6 billion in new original content in 2016. Such investments promise an ever-growing slate of new and continuing Netflix original series, specials, documentaries, and films.

As more and more high-quality video streams out of Netflix, more success streams in. Netflix’s sales have surged 36 percent during the past two years. Last year alone, membership grew by more than 20 percent. Netflix thrives on using big data and marketing analytics to know and serve its customers. The company excels at helping customers figure out just what they want to watch and offering just the right content profitably. Says Netflix’s chief communications officer, “Because we have a direct relationship with consumers, we *know* what people like to watch, and that helps us [immeasurably].”

Cheese to Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Lunchables, and Planters nuts—are found in 98 percent of all North American households.

Kraft has a treasure trove of marketing data, gathered from years of interactions with customers and from its social media monitoring hub called Looking Glass. Looking Glass tracks consumer trends, competitor activities, and more than 100,000 brand-related conversations daily in social media and on blogs. Kraft also reaps data from customer interactions with its *Kraft Food & Family* magazine, email communications, and the more than 100 web and social media sites that serve its large brand portfolio. In all, Kraft has 18 years’ worth of customer data across 22,000 different attributes.

Kraft applies high-level marketing analytics to this wealth of data to mine nuggets of customer insight. Then it uses these insights to shape big data–driven marketing strategies and tactics, from developing new products to creating more focused and personalized web, mobile, and social media content. For example, Kraft’s analytics have identified more than 500 custom target segments.

Within these segments, Kraft knows in detail what consumers need and like. Says one analyst, it knows “their dietary [characteristics and] restrictions—gluten free, a diabetic, low calorie, big snacks, feeding a big family, whether they are new cooks.” Kraft uses this knowledge to personalize digital interactions with individual customers, down to the fine details. “If Kraft knows you’re not a bacon user,” says the analyst, “you will never be served a bacon ad.” Thus, sophisticated analytics let Kraft target the right customer with the right message in the right medium at the right moment.

The benefits of customer relationship management and big data analytics don’t come without costs or risks. The most common mistake is to view CRM and marketing analytics as technology processes only. Or they get buried in the big data details and miss the big picture. Yet technology alone cannot build profitable customer relationships. Companies can’t improve customer relationships by simply installing some new software. Instead, marketers should start with the fundamentals of managing customer relationships and *then* employ high-tech data and analytics solutions. They should focus first on the R—it’s the *relationship* that CRM is all about.
