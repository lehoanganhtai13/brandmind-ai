# 17 Direct, Online, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing

> In the previous three chapters, you learned about engaging consumers and communicating customer value through integrated marketing communication and about four elements of the marketing communications mix: advertising, publicity, personal selling, and sales promotion. In this chapter, we examine direct marketing and its fastest-growing form: digital marketing (online, social media, and mobile marketing). Today, spurred by the surge in internet usage and buying as well as rapid advances in digital technologies—from smartphones, tablets, and other digital devices to the spate of online mobile and social media—direct marketing has undergone a dramatic transformation. As you read this chapter, remember that although direct and digital marketing are presented as separate tools, they must be carefully integrated with each other and with other elements of the promotion and marketing mixes.

> Let’s start by looking at Samsung, the world’s largest information technology company by revenue. The company has blossomed into one of the most powerful names in the tech industry. One of the key reasons to Samsung’s success is its integrated marketing strategy, which takes advantage of surging digital opportunities for direct, up-close-and-personal interactions with customers. Samsung’s digital direct marketing capability strengthens its brand advocacy and elevates its brand loyalty. The company has become a point of reference for direct and digital marketing, and continues to engage customers and create direct, personalized customer relationships.

## SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS: Engaging Customers Globally via Social Media Marketing

One of the key reasons to Samsung’s ongoing success is its marketing strategy, which it has greatly expanded in recent years to take advantage of the surging digital opportunities for direct, up-close-and-personal interactions with customers. Today, Samsung’s digital direct marketing capability strengthens its brand advocacy and elevates its brand loyalty. Samsung’s broad-based direct marketing strategy employs a wide range of cutting-edge digital tools to engage customers. All over the globe, Samsung has been successful at driving consumer behavior from awareness to consideration to purchase through its social media strategy. In Saudi Arabia, for example, it has been featured as the No. 1 buzz brand for the last three years.

Samsung’s customers interact directly with the company and with each other on the company’s many web- and mobile-based platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, placing the company at the forefront of social media marketing. Its Twitter feed, which abounds with engaging tweets and @mentions, had more than 12 million followers by the end of 2016, by far the highest number of followers among its competitors and ahead of celebrities like Kelly Clarkson and Tom Hanks, and other global mega brands like Starbucks and Chanel. In addition, more than 42 million people “like” its Samsung Mobile Facebook page, placing the company far ahead of competition (Apple does not have an official fan page) like Blackberry (27 million), Amazon (27 million), and Sony (24 million). Its other Facebook page, Samsung Mobile USA, assembles 25 million fans alone, which adds up to 67 million fans on Facebook for the company’s mobile phone pages, catapulting the brand into the top 30 Facebook pages in the world.

> Samsung’s passion for creating superb online customer experiences has made it a poster child for direct and digital marketing, and the company continues to engage customers and create direct, personalized customer relationships.

Samsung has put a great deal of consideration into socially enabling its customers and brand ambassadors through its social media presence to network with others by fostering an environment of advocacy and the genuine celebration of its products and services. Moreover, Samsung successfully engages customers globally and directly via influencers and key opinion leaders. Much of Samsung’s most recent social media success has been due to its efforts to launch its latest lines of Galaxy smartphones and tablets. To create awareness and generate buzz about these new Galaxy devices, Samsung usually invites a group of influential and socially active bloggers, Twitterati, and YouTubers for hands-on sneak-peek events before the launch of any new flagship device.
