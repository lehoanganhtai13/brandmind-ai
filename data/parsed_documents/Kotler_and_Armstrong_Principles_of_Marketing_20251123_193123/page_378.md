channel members, and customers. These activities include forecasting, information systems, purchasing, production planning, order processing, inventory, warehousing, and transportation planning.

Companies today are placing greater emphasis on logistics for several reasons. First, companies can gain a powerful competitive advantage by using improved logistics to give customers better service or lower prices.

Second, improved logistics can yield tremendous cost savings to both a company and its customers. As much as 20 percent of an average product’s price is accounted for by shipping and transport alone. American companies spend $1.45 trillion each year—about 8.3 percent of GDP—to wrap, bundle, load, unload, sort, reload, and transport goods.

That’s more than the total national GDPs of all but 12 countries worldwide. ● By itself, General Motors has hundreds of millions of tons of finished vehicles, production parts, and aftermarket parts in transit at any given time, running up an annual logistics bill of around $8 billion dollars. Shaving off even a small fraction of logistics costs can mean substantial savings. For example, GM recently announced a logistical overhaul that would save nearly $2 billion over two years in North America alone.¹⁸

Third, the explosion in product variety has created a need for improved logistics management. For example, in 1916 the typical Piggly Wiggly grocery store carried only 605 items. Today, a Piggly Wiggly carries a bewildering stock of between 20,000 and 35,000 items, depending on store size. A Walmart Supercenter store carries more than 140,000 products, 30,000 of which are grocery products.¹⁹ Ordering, shipping, stocking, and controlling such a variety of products presents a sizable logistics challenge.

Improvements in information technology have also created opportunities for major gains in distribution efficiency. Today’s companies are using sophisticated supply chain management software, internet-based logistics systems, point-of-sale scanners, RFID tags, satellite tracking, and electronic transfer of order and payment data. Such technology lets them quickly and efficiently manage the flow of goods, information, and finances through the supply chain.

Finally, more than almost any other marketing function, logistics affects the environment and a firm’s environmental sustainability efforts. Transportation, warehousing, packaging, and other logistics functions are typically the biggest supply chain contributors to the company’s environmental footprint. Therefore, many companies are now developing *green supply chains*.

### Sustainable Supply Chains

Companies have many reasons for reducing the environmental impact of their supply chains. For one thing, if they don’t green up voluntarily, a host of sustainability regulations enacted around the world will soon require them to. For another, many large customers—from Walmart and Nike to the federal government—are demanding it. Even consumers are demanding it: According to one survey, 50 percent of millennials are willing to pay more for sustainable products and 39 percent do research into the sustainability practices of companies before making a purchase.²⁰ Thus, environmental sustainability has become an important factor in supplier selection and performance evaluation. But perhaps even more important than *having* to do it, designing sustainable supply chains is simply the *right* thing to do. It’s one more way that companies can contribute to saving our world for future generations.

But that’s all pretty heady stuff. As it turns out, companies have a more immediate and practical reason for turning their supply chains green. Not only are sustainable channels good for the world, they’re also good for a company’s bottom line. The very logistics activities that create the biggest environmental footprint—such as transportation,

The importance or logistics: At any given time, GM has hundreds of millions of tons of finished vehicles and parts in transit, running up an annual logistics bill of about $8 billion. Even small savings can be substantial. Bloomberg/Getty Images warehousing, and packaging—also account for a lion’s share of logistics costs.
