# Word-of-mouth influence

The impact of the personal words and recommendations of trusted friends, family, associates, and other consumers on buying behavior can have a powerful impact on consumer buying behavior. The personal words and recommendations of trusted friends, family, associates, and other consumers tend to be more credible than those coming from commercial sources, such as advertisements or salespeople. One recent study found that only 49 percent of consumers reported that they trust or believe advertising, whereas 72 percent said they trusted family and friends and 72 percent said they trust online reviews. Most word-of-mouth influence happens naturally: Consumers start chatting about a brand they use or feel strongly about one way or the other. Often, however, rather than leaving it to chance, marketers can help to create positive conversations about their brands.

Marketers of brands subjected to strong group influence must figure out how to reach **opinion leaders**—people within a reference group who, because of special skills, knowledge, personality, or other characteristics, exert social influence on others. Some experts call this group the *influentials* or *leading adopters*. When these influentials talk, consumers listen. Marketers try to identify opinion leaders for their products and direct marketing efforts toward them.

> **Buzz marketing** involves enlisting or even creating opinion leaders to serve as “brand ambassadors” who spread the word about a company’s products. Consider Mercedes-Benz’s award-winning “Take the Wheel” influencer campaign:

> Mercedes-Benz wanted get more people talking about its all-new, soon-to-be-launched 2014 CLA model, priced at $29,900 and aimed at getting a new generation of younger consumers into the Mercedes brand. So it challenged five of Instagram’s most influential photographers—everyday Gen Y consumers whose stunning imagery had earned them hundreds of thousands of fans—to each spend five days behind the wheel of a CLA, documenting their journeys in photos shared via Instagram. The photographer who got the most Likes got to keep the CLA. The short campaign really got people buzzing about the car, earning 87 million social media impressions and more than 2 million Likes. Ninety percent of the social conversation was positive. And when Mercedes launched the CLA the following month, it broke sales records.

Sometimes, everyday customers become a brand’s best evangelists. For instance, Alan Klein loves the McDonald’s McRib—a sandwich made of a boneless pork patty molded into a rib-like shape, slathered in BBQ sauce and topped with pickles and onion. The McRib is sold for only short time periods each year at McDonald’s restaurants around the nation. Klein loves it so much that he created the McRib Locator app and website (mcrib-locator.com), where McRib fans buzz about locations where they’ve recently sighted the coveted sandwich.

# Online social networks

Over the past several years, a new type of social interaction has exploded onto the scene—online social networking. **Online social networks** are online communities where people socialize or exchange information and opinions. Social networking communities range from blogs (Consumerist, Engadget, Gizmodo) and message boards (Craigslist) to social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn) and even communal shopping sites (Amazon.com and Etsy). These online forms of consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer dialogue have big implications for marketers.

Marketers are working to harness the power of these new social networks and other “word-of-web” opportunities to promote their products and build closer customer relationships. Instead of throwing more one-way commercial messages at consumers, they hope to use digital, mobile, and social media to become an interactive part of consumers’ conversations and lives.

For example, Red Bull has an astounding 44 million friends on Facebook; Twitter and Facebook are the primary ways it communicates with college students. Dunkin’ Donuts uses Vine personality Logan Paul to promote its Dunkin’ Donuts app and DD Perks loyalty program with posts on Vine and other social media. As it turns out, Paul is a genuine Dunkin’ Donuts fan, so the brand lets him figure out what to say to his more than 8.7 million Vine followers, 5.4 million Facebook fans, 2.4 million followers on Instagram, and 615 followers on Twitter.

Other marketers are working to tap the army of self-made influencers already plying the internet—independent bloggers. Believe it or not, there are now almost as many people making a living as bloggers as there are lawyers. The key is to find bloggers who have strong networks of relevant readers, a credible voice, and a good fit with the brand. For example, you’ll no doubt cross paths with the likes of climbers and skiers blogging for Patagonia, bikers blogging for Harley-Davidson, and foodies blogging for Whole Foods Market or Trader Joe’s. And companies such as P&G, McDonald’s, Walmart, and Disney Harnessing the power of online social networking: Dunkin’ Donuts uses Vine personality Logan Paul to promote its Dunkin’ Donuts app and DD Perks loyalty program with posts on Vine and other social media.
