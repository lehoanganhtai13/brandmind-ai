Sound marketing is critical to the success of every organization. Large for-profit firms such as Google, Target, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft use marketing. But so do not-for-profit organizations, such as colleges, hospitals, museums, symphony orchestras, and even churches.

You already know a lot about marketing—it’s all around you. Marketing comes to you in the good old traditional forms: You see it in the abundance of products at your nearby shopping mall and the ads that fill your TV screen, spice up your magazines, or stuff your mailbox. Blue dot But in recent years, marketers have assembled a host of new marketing approaches, everything from imaginative websites and smartphone apps to blogs, online videos, and social media. These new approaches do more than just blast out messages to the masses. They reach you directly, personally, and interactively. Today’s marketers want to become a part of your life and enrich your experiences with their brands. They want to help you *live* their brands.  
At home, at school, where you work, and where you play, you see marketing in almost everything you do. Yet there is much more to marketing than meets the consumer’s casual eye. Behind it all is a massive network of people, technologies, and activities competing for your attention and purchases. This book will give you a complete introduction to the basic concepts and practices of today’s marketing. In this chapter, we begin by defining marketing and the marketing process.

## Marketing Defined

What *is* marketing? Many people think of marketing as only selling and advertising. We are bombarded every day with TV commercials, catalogs, spiels from salespeople, and online pitches. However, selling and advertising are only the tip of the marketing iceberg.  
Today, marketing must be understood not in the old sense of making a sale—“telling and selling”—but in the new sense of *satisfying customer needs*. If the marketer engages consumers effectively, understands their needs, develops products that provide superior customer value, and prices, distributes, and promotes them well, these products will sell easily. In fact, according to management guru Peter Drucker, “The aim of marketing is to make selling unnecessary.”³ Selling and advertising are only part of a larger *marketing mix*—a set of marketing tools that work together to engage customers, satisfy customer needs, and build customer relationships.

> The process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return.

Broadly defined, marketing is a social and managerial process by which individuals and organizations obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging value with others. In a narrower business context, marketing involves building profitable, value-laden exchange relationships with customers. Hence, we define **marketing** as the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return.⁴

## The Marketing Process

Green dot **Figure 1.1** presents a simple, five-step model of the marketing process for creating and capturing customer value. In the first four steps, companies work to understand consumers, create customer value, and build strong customer relationships. In the final step, companies reap the rewards of creating superior customer value. By creating value *for* consumers, they in turn capture value *from* consumers in the form of sales, profits, and long-term customer equity.  
In this chapter and the next, we will examine the steps of this simple model of marketing. In this chapter, we review each step but focus more on the customer relationship **The Marketing Process: Creating and Capturing Customer Value**
