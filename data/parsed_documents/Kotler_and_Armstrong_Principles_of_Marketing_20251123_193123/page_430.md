At these events, the hundreds of people walking around gazing at their phone in search of Pokémon make for singular images. Such information mostly spread through social media, further adding to the buzz: people wanted to know what was in the game that got people so incredibly engrossed. There were many photos of people on social media ending up in funny and sometimes dangerous situations while searching for a Pokémon. There were even reports of people running into mishaps while trying to catch Pokémon. But as they say, all publicity is good publicity; these reports kept Pokémon Go in the news.

Pokémon Go used hardly any paid advertising; there were no television ads, no banner ads, and no newspaper advertisements. Almost all of its promotion has been from engaging the gaming crowd and the influencer community prior to the launch of the game. To create prelaunch hype, Niantic used innovative and non-traditional marketing strategies. Starting in April 2014, they did concept testing through a short-lived viral game using Google maps to catch Pokémons. An entertaining and engaging trailer was released on the official Pokémon Channel in September 2015. The company also released a video along with some teaser screenshots to generate more interest in the game. In April 2016, they started field testing in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Pokémon Go was also presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June 2016. The company released its “Get Up and Go” trailers on IGN’s YouTube Channel prior to the launch of the game on July 6, 2016. After the launch, the company has relied almost exclusively on buzz marketing and word-of-mouth. This has worked especially well because of how marketing and promotion of the game has been built into the game itself; it encourages users to play and share, enjoy and create, explore and socialize.

The astounding success of Pokémon Go is a testament to the power of branding, digital technology, and social media in communicating with today’s consumers. The game’s players become co-creators of its content and even advocates of the brand by sharing that content with other gamers and friends. Playing the game and catching a Pokémon has a ripple effect. Encouraging offline activities like walking to capture a virtual form of one’s favorite childhood character using location services and sharing it with an engaged and networked community through an online social platform is a remarkable blend. It will be interesting to see how Pokémon Go will continue to keep its community engaged and hooked, and what innovations and updates it will introduce to keep the momentum going.
