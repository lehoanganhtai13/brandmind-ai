# Figure 2.1 Steps in Strategic Planning

This table outlines a hierarchical strategic planning framework, starting at the corporate level and cascading down to business units. At the highest corporate level, strategy is defined by three key components: establishing the company mission, setting overarching company objectives and goals, and designing the overall business portfolio. These corporate-level decisions then inform and guide the strategy and planning at the business unit, product, and market level. A crucial overarching principle is that the broader company strategy, much like marketing strategy, must be customer-focused. This customer-centric approach ensures alignment and relevance across all levels of strategic planning within the organization.

## Mission statement

> A statement of the organization’s purpose—what it wants to accomplish in the larger environment.

Many organizations develop formal mission statements that answer these questions.  
A **mission statement** is a statement of the organization’s purpose—what it wants to accomplish in the larger environment. A clear mission statement acts as an “invisible hand” that guides people in the organization.

Some companies define their missions myopically in product or technology terms (“We make and sell furniture” or “We are a chemical-processing firm”). But mission statements should be *market oriented* and defined in terms of satisfying basic customer needs. Products and technologies eventually become outdated, but basic market needs may last forever. For example, social scrapbooking site Pinterest doesn’t define itself as just an online place to post pictures. Its mission is to give people a social media platform for collecting, organizing, and sharing things they love. And Microsoft’s mission isn’t to create the world’s best software, technologies, and devices. It’s to “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”  
**Table 2.1** provides several examples of product-oriented versus market-oriented business definitions.

# Table 2.1 Product- versus Market-Oriented Business Definitions

This table contrasts product-oriented definitions with market-oriented definitions for several companies, illustrating a shift from focusing on what a company *sells* to the broader *value* it provides to customers and society. Product-oriented definitions are direct and functional, such as Chipotle selling "burritos and other Mexican food" or Facebook being an "online social network." In contrast, market-oriented definitions emphasize customer benefits, aspirations, and experiences. For instance, Chipotle offers "Food With Integrity," Facebook "connect[s] people around the world," and Home Depot empowers consumers to "achieve the homes of their dreams." This structure highlights how companies can redefine their purpose from tangible goods or services to intangible benefits like lifestyle, self-expression, experiences, or even societal impact, as seen with NASA's mission to "benefit all humankind." Mission statements should be meaningful and specific yet motivating.
