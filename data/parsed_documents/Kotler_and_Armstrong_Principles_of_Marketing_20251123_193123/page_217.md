# Behavioral Segmentation

Many marketers believe that behavior variables are the best starting point for building market segments.

## Occasions

Buyers can be grouped according to occasions when they get the idea to buy, actually make their purchases, or use the purchased items. **Occasion segmentation** can help firms build up product usage. Campbell’s advertises its soups more heavily in the cold winter months. And for more than a dozen years, Starbucks has welcomed the autumn season with its pumpkin spice latte (PSL). Sold only in the fall, PSLs pull in an estimated $100 million in revenues for Starbucks each year.⁸

Still other companies try to boost consumption by promoting usage during nontraditional occasions. For example, most consumers drink orange juice in the morning, but orange growers have promoted drinking orange juice as a cool, healthful refresher at other times of the day. Similarly, whereas consumers tend to drink soft drinks later in the day, Mountain Dew introduced Mtn Dew A.M. (a mixture of Mountain Dew and orange juice) to increase morning consumption. And Taco Bell’s First Meal campaign attempts to build business by promoting Mtn Dew A.M. (available only at Taco Bell) along with the chain’s A.M. Crunchwrap and other breakfast items as a great way to start the day.

## Benefits Sought

A powerful form of segmentation is grouping buyers according to the different benefits that they seek from a product. **Benefit segmentation** requires finding the major benefits people look for in a product class, the kinds of people who look for each benefit, and the major brands that deliver each benefit.

For example, people who buy wearable health and activity trackers are looking for a variety of benefits, everything from counting steps taken and calories burned to heart rate monitoring and high-performance workout tracking and reporting. To meet these varying benefit preferences, Fitbit makes health and fitness tracking devices aimed at buyers in three major benefit segments: Everyday Fitness, Active Fitness, and Performance Fitness:⁹

Everyday Fitness buyers want only very basic fitness tracking. So Fitbit’s simplest device, the Fitbit Zip, offers these consumers “A fun, simple way to track your day.” It tracks steps taken, distance traveled, calories consumed, and active minutes. The Fitbit One, also aimed at Everyday Fitness buyers, does all that and also monitors how long and well they sleep; the Fitbit Charge adds a wristband and watch. At the other extreme, for the Performance Fitness segment, the high-tech Fitbit Surge helps serious athletes “Train smarter. Go Farther.” The Surge is “the ultimate fitness super watch,” with GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, all-day activity tracking, automatic workout tracking and recording, sleep monitoring, text notification, music control, and wireless synching to Fitbit’s smartphone and computer app.

> In all, within Fitbit’s family of fitness products, no matter what bundle of benefits one seeks, “There’s a Fitbit product for everyone.”

## User Status

Markets can be segmented into non-users, ex-users, potential users, first-time users, and regular users of a product. Marketers want to reinforce and retain regular users, attract targeted non-users, and reinvigorate relationships with ex-users. Included in the potential users group are consumers facing life-stage changes—such as new parents and newlyweds—who can be turned into heavy users. For example, to get new parents off to the right start, P&G makes certain that its Pampers Swaddlers are the diaper most U.S. hospitals provide for newborns and then promotes them as “the #1 choice of hospitals.”

## Usage Rate

Markets can also be segmented into light, medium, and heavy product users. Heavy users are often a small percentage of the market but account
