# Marketing Ethics  Western Stereotypes

In January 2014, the Japanese airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) was forced to pull a TV advertisement after being accused of racist stereotyping by viewers. The TV commercial featured two Japanese men in ANA uniforms. They were discussing, in English with Japanese subtitles, how they could boost the image of ANA as an international airline. The punch line of the commercial saw one of them suggesting that they change the image of Japanese people. The camera then cut back to the other man, who was now wearing a blonde wig and a long rubber nose. These are stereotypical Japanese images of what Westerners look like. This is by no means the first and probably not the last time potentially racist stereotyping of Westerners has been employed in Japanese advertisements. In 2013, Toshiba featured a Japanese girl with a blonde wig and a fake nose in an advertisement for a bread maker. In 2010, Nagasaki Prefecture promoted its foreign-designed buildings with Japanese tourists wearing blonde wigs and big noses. At other times, Westerners have been portrayed as hapless visitors, a role that has not been met with viewers’ approval.

# Marketing by the Numbers  Advertising-to-Sales Ratios

Using the percent of sales method, an advertiser sets its budget at a certain percentage of current or forecasted sales. However, determining what percentage to use is not always clear. Many marketers look at industry averages and competitor spending for comparisons. Websites and trade publications publish data regarding industry averages to guide marketers in setting the percentage to use.

## 14-13  
Find industry advertising-to-sales ratio data. Why do some industries have higher advertising-to-sales ratios than others? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)

## 14-14  
Determine the advertising-to-sales ratios for two competing companies and compare them to the industry advertising-to-sales ratio found above. Why do you think there is a difference between competitors and the industry average? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Analytical Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)

# Video Case  OXO

You might know OXO for its well-designed, ergonomic kitchen gadgets. But OXO’s expertise at creating handheld tools that look great *and* work well has led it to expand into products for bathrooms, garages, offices, babies’ rooms, and even medicine cabinets. In the past, this award-winning manufacturer has managed to move its products into almost every home in the United States by relying on a consistent and in some cases nontraditional marketing strategy.

# Company Case  Volvo Trucks: Integrated Marketing Communications of Epic Proportions

When you think of Volvo, you probably think of the boxy and sedate, practical and safe automobiles made in Sweden—the ones professors and young, married couples with children use to cart their groceries home. This story is about another Volvo—the Volvo Group, maker of trucks. And not just SUVs or pickups, mind you. We’re talking about full-sized, heavy-duty semi-trucks and trailers, mining and construction vehicles, and buses. Once one and the same with Volvo cars, the Volvo Group is now a separate company and one of the largest producers of commercial trucks in the world under various brands including Renault Trucks, Mack Trucks, UD Trucks, and its largest, Volvo Trucks.

A few years ago, Volvo Trucks faced a big challenge. It was preparing for its first major product launch in 20 years—five new truck models in one year. With that launch, Volvo Trucks needed an integrated communication strategy that would achieve a lofty goal—to get people worldwide to talk about its commercial trucks.
