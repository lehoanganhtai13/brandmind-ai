# 8.2 HSBC: Taking Care of Those Who Take Care of the Customer

It was established in its present form in London in 1991 by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (from which it got the initials in its name) to act as a new group holding company. HSBC has around 6,100 offices in 72 countries and territories across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America and around 48 million customers.

Due to their intangible nature, providing services as a form of business is a great challenge, but doing so in dynamic financial markets is even more challenging. Be it about loans, mortgages, accounts, insurance products, or other financial services, most bank customers are now better informed and more demanding than ever before. Despite its global presence, the bank also works hard to maintain a local presence and local knowledge in each area. Its key operating strategy is to remain close to its customers and offer excellent and outstanding customer experience. Succeeding in the business of providing financial services requires more than a basic effort; a significant level of customer-orientation is in order, especially as competition continues to become stiffer. This is one of the key areas where HSBC scores very high in the perception of financial services customers. It is remarkable that as big as it is in structure, from the top to the bottom of the organization, the focus of the entire workforce is predominantly and clearly centered on customer satisfaction. However, the bank acknowledges an important factor that is paramount to its success—its employees.

The bank believes that for the customer to be satisfied, it is very important to take care of those who meet and interact with customers regularly and work toward giving them the utmost satisfaction in their various transactions. The company has emphasized that the talent and diversity of their people is the foundation of its success, so they are committed to helping their employees develop their personal and professional skills in order to bring out their respective strengths. The reasoning is that sound external marketing that is focused on customer satisfaction should be preceded by excellent internal marketing. This is evident in the bank’s three core group values, which can be simply summarized in this statement: HSBC people are dependable and do the right thing, are open to different ideas and cultures, and are connected to customers, communities, regulators and each other. To actualize this philosophy and maintain success in the marketplace, HSBC is strongly committed to its internal marketing, which is simply about identifying the needs of the employees and meeting them effectively to ensure their satisfaction.

The opportunities and motivation for employees are wide-ranging and attractive. As a large financial organization, the bank is in a position to offer its employees thousands of different job opportunities and positions, ranging from customer service and corporate and commercial banking to IT and human resource management. Accordingly, the bank matches these with several benefits and rewards, such as a competitive salary, a contributory pension scheme, employee assistance programs, and flexible working policies. For some roles, it also incentivizes staff members with performance-related bonus schemes, private health care, and life assurance and insurance.

Closely related to this are the bank’s programs for training and development that enrich the staff’s work experience. The approach adopted for training and development of staff at HSBC is specific and special because it gives the employee control over his or her training programs through a portal the company calls “My Learning.” Using this platform, the employee can access all the learning opportunities available. In this respect, the strategy for training and development commits the respective line managers to help their staff to identify potential opportunities and the capabilities they will need to be effective in their role. As part of the HSBC performance review process, the managers work closely with their people to set clear career development goals and provide feedback and support to assist them in achieving the objectives. At the same time, all staff will be encouraged to take responsibility for driving their own personal development.

The bank has its own HSBC Business School, which provides access to a comprehensive set of tools and learning materials based on the employees’ specific role and business area, as well as courses that help them develop soft skills like communication, leadership, and presentation skills. The bank also has an efficient learning and development team composed of seasoned training professionals who work closely with various units in the organization for the training and development programs of their staff members.
