and share ideas about handmade and vintage products and related topics. In addition to its active Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages, Etsy engages 780,000 brand followers on photo-sharing site Instagram, where the Etsy community shares photos of creative ideas and projects. It also engages almost a million followers on social scrapbooking site Pinterest, with 120 boards on topics ranging from “DIY Projects,” “Entertaining,” and “Stuff We Love” to “Etsy Weddings” and even “Yum! Recipes to Share,” where the community posts favorite recipes. Etsy sells few of the ingredients that go into the recipes, but it’s all part of the Etsy lifestyle. Through its extensive online and social media presence, Etsy has created an active and engaged worldwide community of 24 million shoppers and 1.6 million sellers worldwide in what it calls “The marketplace we make together.”[^27]

Social media marketing also presents challenges. First, many companies are still experimenting with how to use them effectively and results are hard to measure. Second, such social networks are largely user controlled. The company’s goal in using social media is to make the brand a part of consumers’ conversations and their lives. However, marketers can’t simply muscle their way into consumers’ digital interactions—they need to earn the right to be there. Rather than intruding, marketers must become a valued part of the online experience by developing a steady flow of engaging content.

Because consumers have so much control over social media content, even a seemingly harmless social media campaign can backfire. In April 2016, to mourn the passing of rock icon Prince, Cheerios, the breakfast cereal owned by US-based General Mills, tweeted their condolences: “Rest in peace,” hashtag #prince. A simple message of condolence intended for fans of both Prince and Cheerios except for one small issue: the company replaced the dot on the ‘i’ with a single O-shaped Cheerio. The Twitterverse responded immediately, interpreting the tweet as an exercise in branding rather than an expression of condolence. General Mills acknowledged its tweet might have been “inappropriate,” apologized, and deleted it. In the interim, Hamburger Helper, another General Mills’ product, also tweeted its condolences, thankfully minus a hamburger. That tweet was also deleted.

In 2016, Aldi Australia asked Twitter users to #tellus when they became an Aldi lover. However the campaign didn’t just generate the expected list of customers’ favorite Aldi brands; the hashtag also turned into a revenge hashtag—a bashtag—with unexpectedly rude, often sexually themed mocking of the supermarket chain by disgruntled customers.

There’s a clear message. With social media, “you’re going into the consumer’s backyard. This is their place,” warns one social marketer. “Social media is a pressure cooker,” says another. “The hundreds of thousands, or millions, of people out there are going to take your idea, and they’re going to try to shred it or tear it apart and find what’s weak or stupid in it.”[^28]

## Integrated Social Media Marketing

Using social media might be as simple as posting some messages and promotions on a brand’s Facebook or Twitter pages or creating brand buzz with videos or images on YouTube, Instagram, or Pinterest. However, most large companies are now designing full-scale social media efforts that blend with and support other elements of a brand’s marketing content strategy and tactics. More than making scattered efforts and chasing “Likes” and tweets, companies that use social media successfully are integrating a broad range of diverse media to create brand-related social sharing, engagement, and customer community.

Managing a brand’s social media efforts can be a major undertaking. For example, Starbucks is one of the most successful social media marketers. Its core social media team connects with its fans through 30 accounts on 12 different social platforms. Frappuccino alone has more than 11 million followers on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and We Heart It. Managing and integrating all that social media content is challenging, but the results are worth the investment. Customers can and do engage with Starbucks by the tens of millions digitally, without ever setting foot in a store.[^29]

But more than just creating online engagement and community, Starbucks’ social media presence also drives customers into its stores. For example, in its first big social media promotion six years ago, Starbucks offered a free pastry with a morning drink purchase. A million people showed up. A more recent “Tweet-a-Coffee” promotion, which let **Mobile marketing** features marketing messages, promotions, and other marketing content delivered to on-the-go consumers through their mobile devices.
