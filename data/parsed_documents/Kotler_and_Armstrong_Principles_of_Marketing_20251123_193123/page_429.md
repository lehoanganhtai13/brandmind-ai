# 14.1 Pokémon Go: Optimizing Offline-to-Online Marketing

The summer of 2016 saw a global cultural and social phenomenon in the form of *Pokémon Go*, a free downloadable app-based game for mobile devices. The game was released in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in July 2016 by Niantic and Nintendo. An overnight sensation, it is one of the largest mobile games to incorporate location-based augmented reality. The game uses the mobile device’s location services and asks players to find and catch over 150 Pokémon characters that might appear on their screens as if they exist in the real world, in and around their locations. The players go to different locations famously known as “Pokestops” to catch Pokémon and compete with other players. Although the game is free, it allows in-app purchases for people who want to quickly progress to the next level of the game.

*Pokémon Go* has broken all previous records of popularity among mobile game apps on both Apple’s App Store and Google Play Market. According to statistics, within 24 hours of being published, *Pokémon Go* was one of the top 10 Android games and had taken first place in the app store in the United States. The game has around 25 million daily active users (DAU), with the average player spending over 40 minutes on the game every day. In less than two days of its release, nearly 6 million copies of *Pokémon Go* had been downloaded in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. These massive download numbers and the resulting server overload led to delays in the release of the game in other countries.

Much of the success of *Pokémon Go* can be attributed to its smart selection of the target market. Although hugely popular with children as well, *Pokémon Go*’s main target market was the Millennials who had watched the Pokémon cartoons, played their games, and collected Pokémon cards some 20 years ago. In the late 1990s, Pokémon was a key part of this demographic’s childhood; these characters were fiercely loved and sought after at the time. *Pokémon Go* targeted these kids of the 1990s who were now all grown up, hooked to their devices, and seriously into the digital and social media. For many nostalgic Millennials, the release of *Pokémon Go* brought back carefree childhood memories. Given a chance to relive their childhood by using good technology available for free, it was sure to become a massive hit.

Bringing the brand franchise into the digital era using social media created the real craze for the game around the world. An iconic brand had come to life again through cutting-edge digital technology by combining augmented reality with location-based services and adding simple photo-sharing using viral content created by its community. The game took viral word of mouth to unprecedented levels and used content marketing in unique ways. *Pokémon Go* leveraged its community engagement, using customer co-creation and user-generated content to promote the game itself. As such, this is marketing built into the gameplay.

*Pokémon Go* is one of the best examples of how the online and offline platforms can combine to give users an outstanding experience of connectedness, socialization, and exploration. The best offline aspect of the game is that it forces the player to go out, take a walk, and look for the Pokémon. Many people have lauded the game for promoting a healthy lifestyle. Niantic believes that it is important to encourage people to go outside in an era of technology that gives people fewer and fewer reasons to do so. The company believes that motivating people to take a walk and explore different parts of their neighborhood and city is the core of everything that the company does.

The game has even encouraged players to initiate spontaneous congregations that created a network effect in many cities across the world. Those who play the game join in, and those who don’t are curious about what everybody is doing. The famous “Pokémon walks” draw large number of Pikachu fans at one place and have a tremendous promotional value—they are originated and
