# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Niching lets smaller companies focus their limited resources on serving niches that may be unimportant to or overlooked by larger competitors. Many companies start as nichers to get a foothold against larger, more resourceful competitors and then grow into broader competitors. For example, Southwest Airlines began by serving intrastate, no-frills commuters in Texas but is now one of the nation’s largest airlines. And Enterprise Rent-A-Car began by building a network of neighborhood offices rather than competing with Hertz and Avis in airport locations. Enterprise is now the nation’s largest car rental company.

Today, the low cost of setting up shop on the internet makes it even more profitable to serve seemingly small niches. Small businesses, in particular, are realizing riches from serving niches on the web. ● Consider online women’s fashion retailer Stitch Fix:[^17]

> Stitch Fix offers affordable personal styling services online to busy women on the go. It positions itself as “Your partner in personal style.” Although “personal service” and “online” might seem a contradiction, Stitch Fix pulls it off with a team of more than 2,000 personal stylists who apply a sophisticated algorithm to determine each customer’s unique sense of style. A customer begins by filling out a detailed style profile that goes far beyond the usual sizing charts. It probes personal preferences with questions such as “What do you like to flaunt?” and “How adventurous do you want your Fix selections to be?” (One answer choice: “Frequently: Adventure is my middle name, bring it on!”) The customer also rates photo montages of different fashions and can even submit links to her own Pinterest pages or other social media.

> Combining the algorithm with large doses of human judgment (the stylist may completely override the algorithm), the personal stylist assembles and ships the customer’s first fashion “Fix”—a box containing five clothing or accessory items pegged to the customer’s special tastes. “Our professional stylists will pick out items they think you’ll love—sometimes a little out of your comfort zone, but that’s part of the fun,” says the company. The customer keeps what she likes and returns the rest, along with detailed feedback. The first Fix is the hardest because the stylist and algorithm are still learning. But after that, the Stitch Fix experience becomes downright addictive for many shoppers. More than 80 percent of customers visit the site within 90 days for a second order, and one-third spend 50 percent of their clothing budget with Stitch Fix. Thanks to the power and personalization qualities of the internet, Stitch Fix is attracting attention and growing fast. The online nicher has inspired a virtual army of pro–Stitch Fix blog and social media posters, and its revenues have skyrocketed to more than $200 million annually.

> Concentrated marketing can be highly profitable. At the same time, it involves higher-than-normal risks. Companies that rely on one or a few segments for all of their business will suffer greatly if the segment turns sour. Or larger competitors may decide to enter the same segment with greater resources. In fact, many large companies develop or acquire niche brands of their own. For example, Coca-Cola’s Venturing and Emerging Brands unit markets a cooler full of niche beverages. Its brands include Honest Tea (the nation’s number-one organic bottled tea brand), NOS (an energy drink popular among auto enthusiasts), FUZE (a fusion of tea, fruit, and other flavors), Zico (pure premium coconut water), Odwalla (natural beverages and bars that “bring goodness to your life”), Fairlife (unfiltered milk), and many others. Such brands let Coca-Cola compete effectively in smaller, specialized markets, and some will grow into future powerhouse brands.[^18]

### Micromarketing

**Micromarketing**  
Tailoring products and marketing programs to the needs and wants of specific individuals and local customer segments; it includes *local marketing* and *individual marketing*.

**Local marketing**  
Tailoring brands and marketing to the needs and wants of local customer segments—cities, neighborhoods, and even specific stores.

Differentiated and concentrated marketers tailor their offers and marketing programs to meet the needs of various market segments and niches. At the same time, however, they do not customize their offers to each individual customer. **Micromarketing** is the practice of tailoring products and marketing programs to suit the tastes of specific individuals and local customer segments. Rather than seeing a customer in every individual, micromarketers see the individual in every customer. Micromarketing includes *local marketing* and *individual marketing*.

**Local Marketing.** Local marketing involves tailoring brands and promotions to the needs and wants of local customers. For example, Marriott’s Renaissance Hotels has rolled out its Navigator program, which hyper-localizes guest experiences at each of its 155 lifestyle hotels around the world.[^19]
