# Costs at Different Levels of Production

To price wisely, management needs to know how its costs vary with different levels of production. For example, suppose Lenovo built a plant to produce 1,000 tablet computers per day.  

## Figure 10.3

This figure illustrates cost behavior at different production levels, distinguishing between short-run and long-run perspectives. Panel A depicts the Short-Run Average Cost (SRAC) curve within a fixed-size plant, showing that cost per unit initially decreases with increased production up to 1,000 units, after which it begins to rise. This U-shaped curve reflects economies and diseconomies of scale within a single plant's operational constraints. Panel B expands this view to the long run, presenting multiple SRAC curves, each representing a different plant size. The Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve is shown as the lower envelope of these SRAC curves, illustrating the optimal plant size for each output level. The LRAC curve demonstrates that in the long run, firms can adjust plant size to achieve lower average costs, with costs per unit decreasing as output increases up to a certain point, after which they may rise due to factors like management complexity. The overarching message is that understanding these cost curves is crucial for effective pricing strategies.

Figure 10.3A shows the typical short-run average cost curve (SRAC). It shows that the cost per tablet is high if Lenovo’s factory produces only a few per day. But as production moves up to 1,000 tablets per day, the average cost per unit decreases. This is because fixed costs are spread over more units, with each one bearing a smaller share of the fixed cost. Lenovo can try to produce more than 1,000 tablets per day, but average costs will increase because the plant becomes inefficient. Workers have to wait for machines, the machines break down more often, and workers get in each other’s way.

If Lenovo believed it could sell 2,000 tablets a day, it should consider building a larger plant. The plant would use more efficient machinery and work arrangements. Also, the unit cost of producing 2,000 tablets per day would be lower than the unit cost of producing 1,000 units per day, as shown in the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve (Figure 10.3B). In fact, a 3,000-capacity plant would be even more efficient, according to Figure 10.3B. But a 4,000-daily production plant would be less efficient because of increasing diseconomies of scale—too many workers to manage, paperwork slowing things down, and so on. Figure 10.3B shows that a 3,000-daily production plant is the best size to build if demand is strong enough to support this level of production.

# Costs as a Function of Production Experience

Suppose Lenovo runs a plant that produces 3,000 tablets per day. As Lenovo gains experience in producing tablets, it learns how to do it better. Workers learn shortcuts and become more familiar with their equipment. With practice, the work becomes better organized, and Lenovo finds better equipment and production processes. With higher volume, Lenovo becomes more efficient and gains economies of scale. As a result, the average cost tends to decrease with accumulated production experience. This is shown in Figure 10.4.

Cost per Unit as a Function of Accumulated Production: The Experience Curve

This data illustrates a cost-volume relationship, specifically demonstrating how the cost per unit decreases as accumulated production increases. The structure is comparative, showing discrete production levels and their corresponding unit costs. Starting at a production of 100,000 units with a cost of $10 per unit, the cost per unit halves with each doubling of accumulated production. This trend continues through 200,000 units ($8/unit) and 400,000 units ($6/unit), reaching 800,000 units at a cost of $4 per unit. The final entry indicates a cost of $2 per unit with no specified accumulated production, suggesting a potential extrapolation or a further point in this decreasing cost trend. The overall pattern highlights economies of scale, where higher production volumes lead to lower per-unit expenses.

> **experience curve (learning curve)**  
> The drop in the average per-unit production cost that comes with accumulated production experience.

Thus, the average cost of producing the first 100,000 tablets is $10 per tablet. When the company has produced the first 200,000 tablets, the average cost has fallen to $8.50. After its accumulated production experience doubles again to 400,000, the average cost is $7. This drop in the average cost with accumulated production experience is called the **experience curve** (or the **learning curve**).

If a downward-sloping experience curve exists, this is highly significant for the company. Not only will the company’s unit production cost fall, but it will fall faster if the company makes and sells more during a given time period. But the market has to stand ready to buy the higher output. And to take advantage of the experience curve, Lenovo must get a large market share early in the product’s life cycle. This suggests the following pricing strategy: Lenovo should price its tablets lower; its sales will then increase, its costs will decrease through gaining more experience, and then it can lower its prices further.

Some companies have built successful strategies around the experience curve. However, a single-minded focus on reducing costs and exploiting the experience curve will not always work. Experience-curve pricing carries some major risks. The aggressive The simplest pricing method is **cost-plus pricing** (or **markup pricing**)—adding a standard markup to the cost of the product.
