# Company Case  
## Bass Pro Shops: Creating Nature’s Theme Park for People Who Hate to Shop

Outdoor-products megaretailer Bass Pro Shops has seemingly been breaking the rules of retail for more than 40 years, basking in the spoils as a result. With more than 90 retail stores throughout the United States and Canada, the privately held Springfield, Missouri–based company reeled in $4.3 billion in revenues last year—nearly $50 million per store—making it the nation’s number-one outdoor-products retailer. Going against common retail wisdom, Bass Pro Shops stores are enormous and are packed to the rafters with overhead. Even more daring, the chain has achieved retail success by targeting customers who hate to shop. The typical Bass Pro Shops customer is a reclusive male outdoorsman who yearns for the great outdoors but detests jostling crowds and shopping.

Over the past few decades, Bass Pro Shops has evolved from a popular mail-order catalog business into one of the nation’s hottest store retailers. Despite Bass Pro Shops often-remote locations, customers flock to its superstores to buy hunting, fishing, and outdoor gear. Nearly 200 million people visited a Bass Pro Shops store last year—almost double the number that attended games put on by the NFL, NBA, and MLB combined. In a true display of “destination retail,” customers drive an average of more than 50 miles to get to a Bass Pro Shops store (some drive hundreds of miles) and stay an average of 2 hours. Schools, churches, and senior centers even send people in by the busload.

### Filling a Gap in the Market

So what explains Bass Pro Shops’s climb to the top? Bass Pro Shops’s ability to reel in hordes of otherwise reluctant shoppers to its stores is part of a double-hook strategy that dates back to the company’s beginning. First, each store guarantees a product assortment as wide as the Mississippi River and as deep as the Mariana Trench. In 1971, Johnny Morris—a tournament fisherman and avid outdoorsman—was frustrated by the lack of decent fishing tackle in sporting goods stores. With the ink on his college diploma barely dry, he rented a U-Haul trailer and headed out on a cross-country road trip, filling the trailer with the latest and greatest in premium fishing tackle. Returning to Springfield, he set up shop in his father’s liquor store near Table Rock Lake. With that, Bass Pro Shops was born.

That first Bass Pro Shops store quickly outgrew his dad’s liquor store, and within a few years, Morris’s vision for what he wanted Bass Pro Shops to become began to take shape. At the time, the sporting goods retail sector was fragmented with lots of independent retail shops catering to different outdoor activities. To meet the needs of customers across the country, Bass Pro Shops printed its first catalog in 1974. The company’s catalog business has been a mainstay ever since.

At the same time, the company moved to fill a gap in brick-and-mortar retail. With no national chain that could serve the outdoor-loving masses, Bass Pro Shops quickly moved beyond fishing, adding hunting, camping, outdoor cooking gear, outdoor footwear and apparel, and nature-themed gifts. During this expansion, Bass Pro Shops not only carried the leading national brands, it also developed a portfolio of store brands, including its first brand, Bass Tracker—the first and still-market-leading dedicated bass boat. By manufacturing and selling direct, Bass Pro Shops could not only pass on huge savings to customers, it could compete on price with just about any company.

As Bass Pro Shops grew rapidly throughout the 1970s, the second hook of its strategy solidified with the opening of the first Outdoor World showroom adjacent to its headquarters. From that day on, Bass Pro Shops became more than a chain of stores that sells lots of cool outdoors stuff—it became a place that provided engaging customer *experiences* for all who visited. Bass Pro Shops has now created what amounts to a natural history theme park for outdoor enthusiasts—the “Walt Disney World” of sporting goods.

### Nature’s Theme Park

Take the store in Memphis, Tennessee, for example—Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid. Former home of the Memphis Grizzlies, the 535,000-square-foot, 32-story glass-and-steel Pyramid now houses the largest Bass Pro Shops store. The store is dominated by various representations of wildlife, from the deer, duck, turkey, bear, bobcat, and wolf tracks imprinted in the concrete floors to the hand-painted murals from renowned artists depicting nature scenes reflecting local geography.

But the Pyramid brings wildlife to life in three dimensions. Each store features lifelike, museum-quality taxidermy animals in action poses—everything from prairie dogs, deer, elk, and caribou to brown bears, polar bears, musk oxen, and mountain goats—set in natural dioramas that make customers feel as though they’re on location in striking outdoor landscapes. And although the animals are stuffed, the Pyramid store boasts 600,000 gallons of water features stocked with live fish and other wildlife. Features include the cypress swamp with an 84,000-gallon alligator habitat (live feedings every Saturday) surrounded by 100-foot-tall trees and the Live Duck Aviary with a four-pond multi-habitat home to five species of ducks.

- The carefully orchestrated wildlife displays set the structure for what amounts to one of the most dynamic and captivating retail adventures in the world. Visitors can ride the nation’s tallest freestanding glass elevator to the Lookout, a breathtaking glass-floored cantilevered observation deck at the top of the Pyramid. From there, they can survey the view outside the store as well as inside. And there is plenty to see inside, including the arcade shooting gallery, archery and pistol ranges, Beretta Fine Gun Center, interactive Ducks Unlimited Waterfowling Heritage Center, and the 103-room Big Cypress Lodge.

Because visitors to Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid often make a day of it, the store has two full-service restaurants on site, including Uncle Buck’s Fishbowl & Grill, one of six company-owned restaurant chains. Uncle Buck’s offers a nautical-themed dining experience with a saltwater aquarium that weaves in and around the restaurant, offering diners full views of exotic and tropical fish. And before or after the meal, diners can work up an appetite or work off calories in the Fishbowl’s 13-lane ocean-themed bowling alley where the balls are returned through a shark’s gaping jaws.

### Half the Size—All the Fun

Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid is larger and more fantastic than any of the chain’s other stores. But each Outdoor World store is designed to shower shoppers with the same captivating experience. Most stores are just under 200,000 square feet—about the size of the average Walmart Supercenter—with only one restaurant and no hotel.
