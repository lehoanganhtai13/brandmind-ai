# Chapter 13 | Retailing and Wholesaling

Macy’s uses beacon technology, by which in-store sensors detect opted-in customers as they enter a Macy’s store, welcome them via the Macy’s app on their phones, and pass along personalized shopping information and “only-for-you” deals.

Social media also play an important part in omni-channel retailing. Thirty percent of shoppers made purchases via social media last year, 44 percent discovered new products via social networks, and 49 percent made purchases based on referrals from social media. In turn, most large store retailers now use social media extensively to engage customers, build community, and link buyers to their websites and stores.

But simply creating a digital-friendly store, high-powered website, and extensive social media presence doesn’t constitute good omni-channel retailing. The key is to integrate these elements to create that critical seamless, anywhere, anytime, omni-channel shopping experience that today’s customers seek. Consider athletic footwear and apparel giant Foot Locker, which operates several chains, including Foot Locker and Champs Sports:

*Foot Locker has mastered omni-channel retailing. It now gets 12 percent of its sales online, half of that from mobile buying, and its online sales are growing at an eye-popping 40 percent annually. Its online and mobile efforts link seamlessly with store operations, offering options such as “buy online, ship from store” and “buy online, reserve in store” for pickup. And you’ll find Foot Locker everywhere in social media, with more than 150 million total followers across Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest, where it builds customer community and pulls customers to its online and store locations.*

Foot Locker’s omni-channel prowess comes to life inside its Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and other stores. The chain gives sales associates the same mobile research capabilities that customers have. Tablets in hand, using online information about products and competitor offers, associates work with and educate customers. Foot Locker trains store employees to go beyond prices and engage customers in ways that add value through personal touches. With 3,500 stores and Foot Locker’s own substantial online presence, the store retailer can help customers to shape almost any kind of shopping experience, including a broad choice of service, payment, and delivery options not available from online-only retailers. Thanks to its omni-channel mastery, whereas other shoe and apparel retailers have had trouble fending off web-only sellers like online star Zappos, Foot Locker is thriving in the new omni-channel shopping environment. Over the past five years, the retailer’s sales have zoomed 47 percent and profits have more than tripled.

An increasing share of the growth in online sales is being captured by omni-channel retailers who successfully merge the virtual and physical worlds. Physical store operators are experiencing considerable digital success, while online merchants—including Amazon—are expanding with showrooms, pop-up shops, and other ways of meeting shoppers face-to-face. “Omnichannel is the new reality for all retailers whether they engage or not. If you’re available where and when consumers look for you, great. If not, you lose to someone who is,” says an analyst. “Online-only retailers lack the high engagement that only the in-store experience can deliver. Offline-only retailers don’t deliver the comfortable and information-browsing experience that consumers utilize to make their shopping itineraries.”[^28]

For example, Macy’s found that customers who shop across channels are eight times more valuable than those who shop in a single channel. Macy’s has become so committed to pushing beyond bricks-and-mortar—where it lately has been downsizing—that it opened an Idea Lab in San Francisco to produce new ideas on online shopping technology. And it has opened a giant 1.3 million-square-foot fulfillment center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that can ship 325,000 orders a day. Macy’s also recently introduced an image-search extension to its mobile application, and the retailer’s 300,000 followers can shop directly via Instagram. Macy’s even offers same-day delivery in 17 markets nationwide. Says the Chief Omnichannel Officer for Macy’s, “Our goal is to provide our shopper with the best experience in whatever way she chooses to interact with us: mobile, desktop, store, or all of them together.”[^29]

## Growing Importance of Retail Technology

As omni-channel shopping becomes the norm, retail technologies have become critically important as competitive tools. Progressive retailers are using advanced information technology and software systems to produce better forecasts, control inventory costs, interact electronically with suppliers, send information between stores, and even sell to customers within stores. They have adopted sophisticated systems for checkout scanning, RFID inventory tracking, merchandise handling, information sharing, and customer interactions.

Perhaps the most startling advances in retail technology concern the ways in which retailers are connecting with consumers. As the surge in online and mobile shopping has changed retail customer behaviors and expectations, a wide range of store retailers are
