And companies ranging from Salesforce.com to Google and IBM offer cloud computing applications that let people collaborate anywhere and everywhere through the internet and mobile devices.

Additionally, for telecommuters who can’t work fully at home, companies such as ShareDesk, DaVinci, and Regus rent out fully equipped shared office space. For a daily, monthly, or yearly fee, telecommuters who work away from a main office can rent shared space that includes the same amenities of a regular office, from networked computers, printers, and copiers to conference rooms and lounge spaces.

## A Better-Educated, More White-Collar, More Professional Population

The U.S. population is becoming better educated. For example, in 2012, 88 percent of the U.S. population over age 25 had completed high school and 32 percent had a bachelor’s degree or better, compared with 66 percent and 16 percent, respectively, in 1980.^(26) The workforce also is becoming more white collar. Job growth is now strongest for professional workers and weakest for manufacturing workers. Between 2014 and 2024, of 30 detailed occupations projected to have the fastest employment growth, most require some type of postsecondary education.^(27) The rising number of educated professionals will affect not just what people buy but also how they buy.

## Increasing Diversity

Countries vary in their ethnic and racial makeup. At one extreme is Japan, where almost everyone is Japanese. At the other extreme is the United States, with people from virtually all national origins. The United States has often been called a melting pot, where diverse groups from many nations and cultures have melted into a single, more homogenous whole. Instead, the United States seems to have become more of a “salad bowl” in which various groups have mixed together but have maintained their diversity by retaining and valuing important ethnic and cultural differences.

Marketers now face increasingly diverse markets, both at home and abroad, as their operations become more international in scope. The U.S. population is about 62.2 percent non-Hispanic white, with Hispanics at 17.4 percent and African Americans at 13.2 percent. The U.S. Asian American population now totals more than 5.4 percent of the total U.S. population, with the remaining groups being Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut. Moreover, one in eight people living in the United States—more than 13 percent of the population—was born in another country. The nation’s ethnic populations are expected to explode in coming decades. By 2060, Hispanics will be about 28 percent of the population, African Americans will be about 14 percent, and Asian Americans will increase to 9 percent.^(28)

Most large companies, from P&G, Walmart, Allstate, and Wells Fargo to McDonald’s and Southwest Airlines, now target specially designed products, ads, and promotions to one or more of these groups. For example, Southwest Airlines’s outreach to Asian Americans includes being the title sponsor for the Chinese New Year Festival and Parade in San Francisco, the biggest nighttime parade in the United States and the second-biggest in North America after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade:^(29)

> San Francisco’s Chinese New Year Festival and Parade typically draws hundreds of thousands of spectators and is broadcast on English- and Asian-language TV stations to viewers around the world. Consumers in the affluent, fast-growing Asian American segment travel often. And they are concentrated in a few key areas such as California and New York, making them easy to pinpoint. That makes them an ideal target for Southwest. The Chinese New Year Festival and Parade event also aligns well with Southwest’s preference for grassroots marketing programs that position it as a hometown carrier targeting local “passion points,” in this case a cultural and family-related celebration.

> ● To support its title sponsorship, Southwest ties its brand to the Lunar New Year through promotional efforts ranging from floats and ticket-giveaway contests to “cleverly constructed well wishes and cheerful nods to the community” on street pole banners, bus shelters, billboards, and traditional broadcast and print ads. Something must be working right—Southwest has been the event’s title sponsor for more than 15 years.
