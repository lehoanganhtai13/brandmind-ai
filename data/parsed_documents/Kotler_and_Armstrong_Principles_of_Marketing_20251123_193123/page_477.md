After starring in dozens of Allstate commercials—each culminating with the question “Are you in good hands?”—Haysbert’s deep voice became a comforting familiarity to television viewers. Today, the “Good Hands” slogan is the oldest surviving slogan for a paid campaign.

## An Advertising Shakeup

Although Allstate’s advertising served it well for decades, the company eventually fell into the same routine as the rest of the insurance industry. Big auto insurance companies were spending modestly on sleepy ad campaigns featuring touchy-feely, reassuring messages such as Allstate’s “You’re in good hands,” or State Farm’s “Like a good neighbor.” In an industry characterized by low budgets and even lower-key ads, no brand’s marketing stood out.

However, the advertising serenity ended with the first appearance of the now-iconic GEICO Gecko, backed by a big budget, pitching direct sales and low prices. That single GEICO ad campaign sparked a frenzy of ad spending and creativity in the insurance industry that quickly escalated into a full-scale advertising war. Once-conservative car insurance ads became creative showstoppers, as edgy and creative as ads found in any industry. Here are a few highlights:

* **GEICO:** GEICO got the auto insurance advertising wars rolling when it was acquired by billionaire Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway company and given a blank check to aggressively increase market share. That led to an onslaught of advertising the likes of which the auto insurance industry had never seen. A string of creative GEICO campaigns featured everything from civilized cavemen to a stack of cash with googly eyes. But it was the GEICO Gecko that had the biggest impact. With his signature English accent, the Gecko made GEICO’s simple message clear—“15 minutes can save you 15 percent or more on car insurance.” More than any other industry spokesperson, the Gecko lent personality and pizzazz to the previously sleepy insurance industry and its staid brands.

* **Progressive:** Following GEICO’s lead, Progressive created its own perky and endearing personality—Flo. Progressive created the ever-upbeat, ruby-lipped sales clerk to help convince consumers who are already in the market that they can get an even better price deal from Progressive. Flo helped put Progressive hot on the heels of rising GEICO as the fourth-largest auto insurer. Flo assists people when they are ready to shop. Progressive later introduced a complementary campaign featuring the Messenger—the mustachioed, leather-jacket-wearing stranger—and Brad—the easy-going, self-assured man with an absurdly funny sense of self-esteem who refers to himself only in the third person. Like the GEICO Gecko, Flo, the Messenger, and Brad have pitched price savings as their primary appeal.

* **State Farm:** As GEICO and Progressive shook up the industry with their direct, low-price, high-profile selling models, conventional agent-based auto insurers were forced to respond. Ninety-year-old State Farm, the long-time industry leader, was hardly a stranger to advertising. Like Allstate, State Farm had a long-standing, widely recognized slogan—“Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”—a jingle written by pop music icon Barry Manilow way back in 1971. Sensing the threat from the rising newcomers, State Farm fought back vigorously with a new campaign centered on its enduring jingle. In its “magic jingle” campaign, State Farm agents magically appear when summoned with the jingle by young drivers in trouble—including the likes of LeBron James. The campaign’s goal—to convince consumers that they still need the services of one of State Farms’ 18,000 agents. To help make the point more forcefully, State Farm doubled its ad budget.

## “Good Hands” Meets Mayhem

Amid this surge in competition and advertising creativity, Allstate struggled just to hold its own, let alone to grow. In the wake of the Gecko and Flo, Allstate had lost market share for two years running, even with Haysbert’s presence as company pitchman. The brand needed its own over-the-top personality. So Allstate tapped ad agency Leo Burnett to bring mayhem to life—literally. With the new creepy Mayhem character played by actor Dean Winters, Allstate created a villainous counterpart to Haysbert’s soothing hero. The campaign’s goal: to convince consumers that there is more to buying car insurance than just price. 

> “We knew we needed . . . a loud thunderclap to tell people that we cared about them,” said Lisa Cochrane, senior VP of marketing at Allstate. “Mayhem is there to change the conversation, to disrupt the commoditization of insurance, and to provide you with something to think about to make sure that you have the right coverage.” A Leo Burnett executive put it more bluntly—“We wanted to kick Flo’s ass.”

Mayhem portrays all of the unlikely events that can lead to a major auto insurance claim. He first appeared as a tree branch falling on a car, then as an emotionally compromised teenager ramming her pink SUV into an unsuspecting vehicle. According to Cochrane, after only these two early ads, “it made an impression.” The possible situations for Mayhem are endless. As a deer, Mayhem jumps into the path of a moving car at night, “because that’s what we deer do.” As a torrential downpour, he loves leaky sunroofs. As a malfunctioning GPS, he sends a driver swerving into another car. As snow, he weighs down the roof of a garage until it collapses, smashing the car within. Each quirky ad ends with the statement and question “If you have cut-rate insurance, you could be paying for this yourself. Are you in good hands?”

Through such clever ads, Allstate’s creative “Mayhem. It’s Everywhere.” campaign has put a contemporary, attention-grabbing twist on the company’s long-standing “You’re in good hands with Allstate” slogan, helping to position the brand as a superior alternative to price-oriented competitors. Even with its long-standing “Good Hands” campaign, Allstate needed something unconventional. In fact, mayhem didn’t just describe the Allstate campaign—it characterized the entire world of auto insurance advertising.

The Mayhem campaign was not only well-received by consumers, it earned critical acclaim, winning approximately 80 advertising awards in the first year. But perhaps a bigger indication of the campaign’s impact is the extent to which the character has become ingrained in pop culture. Although Mayhem has only a little more than a third of Flo’s 4.9 million Facebook fans, he commands an engagement score roughly five times that of Progressive’s perky spokeswoman. And when the character’s creator recently saw a Mayhem-costumed trick-or-treater walking down her street, she called it “a career highlight that gave her chills.”

More than just popular, Mayhem is right on message. At the end of each ad, he warns, “If you’ve got cut-rate insurance, you could be paying for this yourself.” Then the reassuring voice of Haysbert provides the solution: “Are you in good hands?” he asks. “Get Allstate. You can save money and be better protected from Mayhem.” This “worth-paying-a-little-more” message puts Allstate back at the top in terms of customer value.

## Mayhem Redux

Allstate’s ads were not only creative, they were effective. After a few years of Mayhem ads complementing Haysbert’s Good Hands ads, Allstate’s unaided brand awareness of 74 percent trailed State Farm’s by only a slight margin, despite State Farm’s 60 per- cent greater ad spending.
