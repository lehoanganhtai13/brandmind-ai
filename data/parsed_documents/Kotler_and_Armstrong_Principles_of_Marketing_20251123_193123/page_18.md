### The Seventeenth Edition of Kotler/Armstrong’s *Principles of Marketing!* Setting the World Standard in Marketing Education

Recent surges in digital technologies have created a new, more engaging, more connected marketing world. Beyond traditional tried-and-true marketing concepts and practices, today’s marketers have added a host of new-age tools for engaging consumers, building brands, and creating customer value and relationships. In these digital times, sweeping advances in “the Internet of Things”—from social and mobile media, connected digital devices, and the new consumer empowerment to “big data” and new marketing analytics—have profoundly affected both marketers and the consumers they serve.

All around the world—across five continents, more than 40 countries, and 24 languages—students, professors, and business professionals have long relied on Kotler/Armstrong’s *Principles of Marketing* as the most-trusted source for teaching and learning about the latest developments in basic marketing concepts and practices. More than ever, the seventeenth edition introduces new marketing students to the fascinating world of modern marketing in a complete and authoritative yet fresh, practical, and engaging way.

Once again, we’ve added substantial new content and poured over every page, table, figure, fact, and example in order to make this the best text from which to learn about and teach marketing. Enhanced by MyMarketingLab, our online homework and personalized study tool, the seventeenth edition of *Principles of Marketing* remains the world standard in introductory marketing education.

### Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement in the Digital and Social Age

Top marketers share a common goal: putting the consumer at the heart of marketing. Today’s marketing is all about creating customer value and engagement in a fast-changing, increasingly digital and social marketplace.

Marketing starts with understanding consumer needs and wants, determining which target markets the organization can serve best, and developing a compelling value proposition by which the organization can attract and grow valued consumers. Then, more than just making a sale, today’s marketers want to *engage* customers and build deep customer relationships that make their brands a meaningful part of consumers’ conversations and lives.

In this digital age, to go along with their tried-and-true traditional marketing methods, marketers have a dazzling set of new online, mobile, and social media tools for engaging customers anytime, anyplace to jointly shape brand conversations, experiences, and community. If marketers do these things well, they will reap the rewards in terms of market share, profits, and customer equity. In the seventeenth edition of *Principles of Marketing*, you’ll learn how *customer value* and *customer engagement* drive every good marketing strategy.
