Burgeoning tablet demand following the iPad introduction also opened the market to a host of new competitors, such as Samsung, Google, and Microsoft.

However, a company may not view all its competitors as beneficial. An industry often contains *good competitors* and *bad competitors*. Good competitors play by the rules of the industry. Bad competitors, in contrast, break the rules. They try to buy share rather than earn it, take large risks, and play by their own rules.

● For example, the nation’s traditional newspapers face a lot of bad competitors these days. Digital services that overlap with traditional newspaper content are bad competitors because they offer for free real-time content that subscription-based newspapers printed once a day can’t match. An example is the *Huffington Post*, the Pulitzer Prize–winning online newspaper started in 2005 by Arianna Huffington as an outlet for liberal commentary. The publication has since expanded and is now owned by AOL, which is in turn owned by Verizon. The site offers news, blogs, and original content and covers politics, business, entertainment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women’s interest, and local news. The ad-supported site is free to users versus the subscription rates charged by traditional newspapers, and that’s about as bad as a competitor can get. HuffingtonPost.com is currently the 38th most visited site in the United States.⁵ Such digital competitors have helped to drive many traditional newspapers into bankruptcy in recent years.

## Finding Uncontested Market Spaces

Rather than competing head-to-head with established competitors, many companies seek out unoccupied positions in uncontested market spaces. They try to create products and services for which there are no direct competitors. Called a “blue-ocean strategy,” the goal is to make competition irrelevant.⁶

Companies have long engaged in head-to-head competition in search of profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet in today’s overcrowded industries, competing head-on results in nothing but a bloody “red ocean” of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. In their book *Blue Ocean Strategy*, two strategy professors contend that although most companies compete within such red oceans, the strategy isn’t likely to create profitable growth in the future. Tomorrow’s leading companies will succeed not by battling competitors but by creating “blue oceans” of uncontested market space. Such strategic moves—termed *value innovation*—create powerful leaps in value for both the firm and its buyers, creating all-new demand and rendering rivals obsolete. By creating and capturing blue oceans, companies can largely take rivals out of the picture.

Apple has long practiced this strategy, introducing product firsts such as the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, App Store, and iPad that created whole new categories. Similarly, Redbox reinvented the DVD-rental category via kiosks in convenient locations. And rather than competing against traditional coffee maker brands such as Hamilton Beach and Mr. Coffee that brew coffee by the pot, Keurig reinvented the process with innovative cup-at-a-time, pod-based coffee makers. As a result, Keurig has achieved annual sales of coffee makers and pods exceeding $4.5 billion and captures 60 percent of the U.S. single-serve market.⁷

● Another example is Cirque du Soleil, which reinvented the circus as a higher form of modern entertainment targeting adults rather than children. At a time when the circus industry was declining, Cirque du Soleil innovated by eliminating high-cost and controversial elements such as animal acts and bearded ladies, instead focusing on artistic theatrical experiences. Cirque du Soleil did not compete with then–market leader Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey; it was altogether different from anything that preceded it. Instead, it created an uncontested new market space that made existing competitors irrelevant.
