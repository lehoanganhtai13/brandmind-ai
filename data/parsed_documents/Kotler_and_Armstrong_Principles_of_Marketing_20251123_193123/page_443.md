## Advertising and Sales Promotion

Advertisers must not make false claims, such as suggesting that a product cures something when it does not. They must avoid ads that have the capacity to deceive, even though no one actually may be deceived. An automobile cannot be advertised as getting 32 miles per gallon unless it does so under typical conditions, and diet bread cannot be advertised as having fewer calories simply because its slices are thinner.

Sellers must avoid bait-and-switch advertising that attracts buyers under false pretenses. For example, a large retailer advertised a sewing machine at $179. However, when  
consumers tried to buy the advertised machine, the seller downplayed its features, placed faulty machines on showroom floors, understated the machine’s performance, and took other actions in an attempt to switch buyers to a more expensive machine. Such actions are both unethical and illegal.

A company’s trade promotion activities also are closely regulated. For example, under the Robinson-Patman Act, sellers cannot favor certain customers through their use of trade promotions. They must make promotional allowances and services available to all resellers on proportionately equal terms.

Beyond simply avoiding legal pitfalls, such as deceptive or bait-and-switch advertising, companies can use advertising and other forms of promotion to encourage and promote socially responsible programs, actions, and ideas. Companies in almost every industry now promote a wide range of social and environmental causes related to their brands (see Real Marketing 14.2). For example, Google recently launched a $50 million “Made with Code” marketing and advertising campaign that encourages young girls to pursue science and technology careers. The company found that 74 percent of middle school girls express interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), but by high school, less than 1 percent of girls plan to major in computer science. Through ads, dedicated digital and social media sites, events, and partnerships with not-for-profit organizations, Google’s campaign promotes the idea that the things young girls love, from their smartphone apps to fashions to their favorite movies, are “made with code.” “Simply put, code is a tool that lets you write your story with technology,” says Google. “Girls start out with a love of science and technology, but lose it somewhere along the way. Let’s help encourage that passion.”[^18]

## Personal Selling

A company’s salespeople must follow the rules of “fair competition.” Most states have enacted deceptive sales acts that spell out what is not allowed. For example, salespeople may not lie to consumers or mislead them about the advantages of buying a particular product. To avoid bait-and-switch practices, salespeople’s statements must match advertising claims.

Different rules apply to consumers who are called on at home or who buy at a location that is not the seller’s permanent place of business versus those who go to a store in search of a product. Because people who are called on may be taken by surprise and may be especially vulnerable to high-pressure selling techniques, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has adopted a *three-day cooling-off rule* to give special protection to customers who are not seeking products. Under this rule, customers who agree in their own homes, workplace, dormitory, or facilities rented by the seller on a temporary basis—such as hotel rooms, convention centers, and restaurants—to buy something costing more than $25 have 72 hours in which to cancel a contract or return merchandise and get their money back—no questions asked.
