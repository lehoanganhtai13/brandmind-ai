# Exchanges and Relationships

**Exchange** is the act of obtaining a desired object from someone by offering something in return. In the broadest sense, the marketer tries to bring about a response to some market offering. The response may be more than simply buying or trading products and services. A political candidate, for instance, wants votes; a church wants membership and participation; an orchestra wants an audience; and a social action group wants idea acceptance.

Marketing consists of actions taken to create, maintain, and grow desirable exchange *relationships* with target audiences involving a product, service, idea, or other object. Companies want to build strong relationships by consistently delivering superior customer value. We will expand on the important concept of managing customer relationships later in the chapter.

# Markets

The concepts of exchange and relationships lead to the concept of a market. A **market** is the set of actual and potential buyers of a product or service. These buyers share a particular need or want that can be satisfied through exchange relationships.

Marketing means managing markets to bring about profitable customer relationships. However, creating these relationships takes work. Sellers must search for and engage buyers, identify their needs, design good market offerings, set prices for them, promote them, and store and deliver them. Activities such as consumer research, product development, communication, distribution, pricing, and service are core marketing activities.

Although we normally think of marketing as being carried out by sellers, buyers also carry out marketing. Consumers market when they search for products, interact with companies to obtain information, and make their purchases. In fact, today’s digital technologies, from online sites and smartphone apps to the explosion of social media, have empowered consumers and made marketing a truly two-way affair. Thus, in addition to customer relationship management, today’s marketers must also deal effectively with *customer-managed relationships*. Marketers are no longer asking only “How can we influence our customers?” but also “How can our customers influence us?” and even “How can our customers influence each other?”

game on one screen with another game on the screen next to it? Your Guest Experience Captain sees to it. Need help with a tablet? Your captain lends a hand. Want to try some new sauces? Your captain will make suggestions and even bring out samples of different sauces with complimentary fries for dipping.

Adding Guest Experience Captains is a major expense, especially when multiplied across shifts in all 1,100 stores. But Buffalo Wild Wings reasons that the captains will more than pay for themselves by enhancing the all-important guest experience, keeping customers around longer, and bringing them back more often. Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants with captains are achieving record levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty compared with those that have not yet brought captains on board. “It’s just an opportunity for us to go a little deeper with the community than our competitors,” says the B-Dubs marketing chief.

True to its “ultimate sports experience” mission, Buffalo Wild Wings actively engages its customers digitally and socially outside its restaurants as well as inside. In fact, the company brags that it’s the number-one brand in its industry for digital fan engagement. B-Dubs’s very active website draws 3 million visitors per month. The brand has more than 12 million Facebook fans, 660,000 Twitter followers, and very active YouTube and Instagram pages. It recently launched GameBreak, an app for fantasy football and other games that can be played inside or outside its restaurants. According to the company’s customer experience executive, GameBreak players visit more often, stay longer, and tend to “buy that second or third beer or maybe one more basket of wings.” In all, Buffalo Wild Wings creates a host of both in-store and online promotions that inspire camaraderie. “It’s about giving [customers] tools to not just be spectators but advocates of the brand,” says the chain.

Catering to the customer experience has paid big dividends for Buffalo Wild Wings. B-Dubs is now the nation’s number-one seller of chicken wings and largest pourer of draft beer. Over the past five years, as other casual-dining restaurants have struggled with fierce competition and slow growth, B-Dubs’s sales have more than tripled and profits are up 250 percent. The chain’s “hottest wing coating available comes with a warning to B-Dubs’ customers: ‘keep away from eyes, pets, and children.’ The sauce is called ‘Blazin’,’ says one analyst. ‘That term also happens to be a good description of the stock’s performance lately.’”
