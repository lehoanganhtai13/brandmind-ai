# Extending Marketing

Cake form. Likewise, Philips began to make a profit in Japan only after it reduced the size of its coffeemakers to fit into smaller Japanese kitchens and its shavers to fit smaller Japanese hands. And Panasonic’s refrigerator sales in China surged 10-fold in a single year after it shaved the width of its appliances by 15 percent to fit smaller Chinese kitchens. Straight extension is tempting because it involves no additional product development costs, manufacturing changes, or new promotion. But it can be costly in the long run if products fail to satisfy consumers in specific global markets.

**Product adaptation** involves changing the product to meet local requirements, conditions, or wants. For example, in the United States, Dunkin’ Donuts sells good old glazed, powdered sugar, jelly, cream-filled, and chocolate-covered doughnuts to on-the-go customers in the morning. In South Korea, however, you’ll find an olive oil and tapioca starch donut called a Chewisty. In China, Dunkin’ serves doughnuts covered in mango pudding or green tea; in Russia, it dishes up doughnuts filled with scalded cream. And in many major global markets, Dunkin’ Donuts adjusts more than just the doughnuts.  
● In India, for example, the company has also adjusted its full menu, its operations, and even its name to suit the local culture:

> “My grandmother only recently found out what a doughnut is,” says a 20-something Indian business professional as she wraps her mouth around a Dunkin’ Donuts Original Tough Guy Chicken Burger. “I don’t think anyone would come [here] just for a doughnut.”  
> As it turns out, Indian consumers don’t start their day with frosted sweets or even with an early breakfast on the go. People usually eat breakfast at home with their families. And unlike Americans, they’ll maybe eat a doughnut for dessert, but they want a meal first.  
>  
> So Dunkin’ Donuts has reworked its strategy for India, making a drastic shift from a predominantly “a.m. brand” to more of a “p.m. brand.” For starters, it changed its store hours, opening later in the morning and staying open later at night. It even changed its name, to “Dunkin’ Donuts & More.” To be sure, the chain serves a full selection of India-inspired doughnuts—stuffed, topped, and glazed with everything from rice pudding to saffron to crushed pistachios. (Top sellers in India include “It’s a Mistake,” a white chocolate doughnut topped with guava and chili.) But Dunkin’ features the doughnuts more as after-meal desserts. Befitting its new “& More” name, Dunkin’s all-day menu includes a hefty lineup of savory sandwiches, wraps, and eight varieties of burgers (all beef-free), such as the Brute Tough Guy Veg Burger. The adapted format is working well for Dunkin’ Donuts, which plans to have more than 100 outlets in India by next year.

**Product adaptation**  
Adapting a product to meet local conditions or wants in foreign markets.

**Product invention**  
Creating new products or services for foreign markets.

**Product invention** consists of creating something new to meet the needs of consumers in a given country. As markets have gone global, companies ranging from appliance manufacturers and carmakers to candy and soft drink producers have developed products that meet the special purchasing needs of low-income consumers in developing economies.

For example, Chinese appliance producer Haier developed sturdier washing machines for rural users in emerging markets, where it found that lighter-duty machines often became clogged with mud when farmers used them to clean vegetables as well as clothes. And solar lighting manufacturer d.light Solar has developed affordable solar-powered home lighting systems for the hundreds of millions of people in the developing world who don’t have access to reliable power. d.light’s hanging lamps and portable lanterns require no energy source other than the sun and can last up to 15 hours on one charge. The company has already reached 51 million users, is adding 1 million users per month, and plans to reach 100 million users by 2020.

## Promotion

Companies can either adopt the same communication strategy they use in the home market or change it for each local market. Consider advertising messages. Some global companies use a standardized advertising theme around the world. For example, Chevrolet recently swapped out its previous, American-focused “Chevy Runs Deep” positioning and advertising theme with a more global “Find New Roads” theme. The new theme is one “that works in all markets,” says a GM marketing executive.  
● “The theme has meaning in mature markets like the U.S. as well as emerging markets like Russia and India, where the potential for continued growth is the greatest.” The time is right for a more globally consistent Chevy brand message. Chevrolet sells cars in more than 140 countries, and nearly two-thirds of its sales are now outside the United States, compared with only about one-third a decade ago.
