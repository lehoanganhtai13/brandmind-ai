# 16 Personal Selling and Sales Promotion

> In the previous two chapters, you learned about engaging customers and communicating customer value through integrated marketing communications (IMC) and two elements of the promotion mix: advertising and public relations. In this chapter, we examine two more IMC elements: personal selling and sales promotion. Personal selling is the interpersonal arm of marketing communications, in which the sales force engages customers and prospects to build relationships and make sales. Sales promotion consists of short-term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or service. Although this chapter presents personal selling and sales promotion as separate tools, they must be carefully integrated with the other elements of the promotion mix.

> First, let’s look at a real-life sales force. When you think of salespeople, perhaps you think of pushy retail sales clerks, “yell and sell” TV pitchmen, or the stereotypical glad-handing “used-car salesman.” But such stereotypes don’t fit the reality of most of today’s salespeople—sales professionals who succeed not by taking advantage of customers but by listening to their needs and helping to forge solutions. Consider Salesforce—the industry leader in customer relationship management solutions. Salesforce not only produces market-leading sales management software, it also excels at practicing what it preaches—effective personal selling.

## SALESFORCE: You Need a Great Sales Force to Sell Salesforce

Salesforce is way out in front of the $20 billion market for customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. The Salesforce logo, set inside the image of a puffy cloud, underscores Salesforce’s highly successful cloud-based computing model (no software to install or own). Cloud-based systems are common today, but they were state-of-the-art when Salesforce pioneered the concept more than 15 years ago. Since then, the company has established itself as a leading innovator, constantly finding new ways to help client companies connect with customers and achieve greater sales force effectiveness using the latest online, mobile, social, and cloud technologies.

Salesforce helps businesses to “supercharge their sales.” It supplies what it calls a “Customer Success Platform,” a wide array of cloud-based sales force automation and customer relationship management tools that gather, organize, analyze, and disseminate in-depth data about a company’s customers, sales, and individual sales rep and overall sales force performance. From its home in the cloud, Salesforce makes all these data and analyses readily available anytime, from anywhere, on any device with online access—desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Salesforce also integrates with major social media, providing tools for social media monitoring and real-time customer engagement and collaboration on its Salesforce Chatter platform, a kind of Facebook for enterprises.

Salesforce’s innovative products have made it the world’s number-one and fastest-growing CRM platform, ahead of blue-chip competitors such as Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and IBM. The company’s revenues hit $6.2 billion last year, up an impressive 24 percent over the previous year and more than four times what they were just five years ago. Salesforce has placed first or second on *Forbes* World’s Most Innovative Company in any industry list for six straight years.

> Salesforce leads the market in sales force automation and customer relationship management solutions. But even Salesforce’s innovative products won’t sell themselves. The company knows that it needs a great sales force to sell Salesforce.

Innovative products and platforms have played a major role in Salesforce’s stunning success. But even the best products don’t sell themselves. You need a great sales force to sell Salesforce, and the company excels at practicing what it preaches—effective personal selling. Like the companies that buy its services, Salesforce has its own army of experienced, well-trained, highly motivated sales reps who take the company’s products to customers.
