Finally, you can even create your own personalized online résumé at sites such as optimalresume.com.

# Online Résumés
The internet is now a widely used job-search environment, so it’s a good idea to have your résumé ready for the online environment. You can forward it to networking contacts or recruiting professionals through email. You can also post it in online databases with the hope that employers and recruiters will find it.

Successful internet-ready résumés require a different strategy than that for paper résumés. For instance, when companies search résumé banks, they search key words and industry buzz words that describe a skill or the core work required for each job, so nouns are much more important than verbs. Two good resources for preparing internet-ready résumés are Goodwill Community Foundation (www.gcflearnfree.org/resumewriting/9/print) and the Riley Guide (www.rileyguide.com/eresume.html).

After you have written your internet-ready résumé, you need to post it. The following sites may be good locations to start: Monster (www.monster.com), LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/job/home), and CareerBuilder.com (www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/postnewresume.aspx). However, use caution when posting your résumé on various sites. In this era of identity theft, you need to select sites with care so as to protect your privacy. Limit access to your personal contact information, and don’t use sites that offer to “blast” your résumé into cyberspace.

# Résumé Tips
* Communicate your worth to potential employers in a concrete manner, citing examples whenever possible.
* Be concise and direct.
* Use active verbs to show you are a doer.
* Do not skimp on quality or use gimmicks. Spare no expense in presenting a professional résumé.
* Have someone critique your work. A single typo can eliminate you from being considered.
* Customize your résumé for specific employers. Emphasize your strengths as they pertain to your targeted job.
* Keep your résumé compact, usually one page.
* Format the text to be attractive, professional, and readable. Times New Roman is often the font of choice. Avoid too much “design” or gimmicky flourishes.

# Write Cover Letter, Follow Up, and Assemble Supporting Documents

## Cover Letter
You should include a cover letter informing the employer that a résumé is enclosed. But a cover letter does more than this. It also serves to summarize in one or two paragraphs the contents of the résumé and explains why you think you are the right person for the position. The goal is to persuade the employer to look at the more detailed résumé. A typical cover letter is organized as follows:  
(1) the name and position of the person you are contacting;  
(2) a statement identifying the position you are applying for, how you heard of the vacancy, and the reasons for your interest;  
(3) a summary of your qualifications for the job;  
(4) a description of what follow-ups you intend to make, such as phoning in two weeks to see if the résumé has been received; and  
(5) an expression of gratitude for the opportunity of being a candidate for the job.  

CareerOneStop (www.careeronestop.org/ResumeGuide/Writeeffectivecoverletters.aspx) offers a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a cover letter, and Susan Ireland’s website contains more than 50 cover letter samples (susanireland.com/letter/cover-letter-examples). Another popular guide is Jeremy Schifeling, *Get It Done: Write a Cover Letter* (Adams Media, 2016).

## Follow Up
Once you send your cover letter and résumé to prospective employers via the method they prefer—email, their website, or regular mail—it’s often a good idea to follow up. In today’s market, job seekers can’t afford to wait for interviews to find them. A quality résumé and an attractive cover letter are crucial, but a proper follow-up may be the key to landing an interview.
