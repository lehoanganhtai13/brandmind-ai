> Beyond measuring marketing return on investment in terms of standard performance measures such as sales or market share, many companies are using customer relationship measures, such as customer satisfaction, engagement, retention, and equity. These are more difficult to measure but capture both current and future performance.

This diagram illustrates the relationship between marketing investments and their returns, structured as a causal flow. Marketing investments are presented as the initial input, leading to various marketing returns. These returns encompass improved customer value and engagement, which in turn manifest as increased customer attraction and increased customer retention. These two outcomes then contribute to increased customer lifetime values and customer equity. Ultimately, the overarching metric of Marketing return on investment is presented as the key outcome, juxtaposed against the Cost of marketing investment, suggesting a comparative analysis of profitability. The structure highlights a progression from initial investment through intermediate customer-centric outcomes to a final financial evaluation.

> As one chief marketing officer says, “You have to be able to move on to those deeper engagement metrics, which show that for the money that I’m spending, here are the various programs that are working in terms of driving engagement with customers and ultimately driving purchase behavior and revenue.”[^16]

# 2 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review

In Chapter 1, we defined marketing and outlined the steps in the marketing process. In this chapter, we examined company-wide strategic planning and marketing’s role in the organization. Then we looked more deeply into marketing strategy and the marketing mix and reviewed the major marketing management functions. So you’ve now had a pretty good overview of the fundamentals of modern marketing.

**OBJECTIVE 2-1** Explain company-wide strategic planning and its four steps. *(pp 64–66)*

Strategic planning sets the stage for the rest of the company’s planning. Marketing contributes to strategic planning, and the overall plan defines marketing’s role in the company.

Strategic planning involves developing a strategy for long-run survival and growth. It consists of four steps:  
1. Defining the company’s mission,  
2. Setting objectives and goals,  
3. Designing a business portfolio, and  
4. Developing functional plans.  

The company’s mission should be market oriented, realistic, specific, motivating, and consistent with the market environment. The mission is then transformed into detailed supporting goals and objectives, which in turn guide decisions about the business portfolio. Then each business and product unit must develop detailed marketing plans in line with the company-wide plan.

**OBJECTIVE 2-2** Discuss how to design business portfolios and develop growth strategies. *(pp 66–72)*

Guided by the company’s mission statement and objectives, management plans its business portfolio, or the collection of businesses and products that make up the company. The firm wants to produce a business portfolio that best fits its strengths and weaknesses to opportunities in the environment. To do this, it must analyze and adjust its current business portfolio and develop growth and downsizing strategies for adjusting the future portfolio. The company might use a formal portfolio-planning method. But many companies are now designing more-customized portfolio-planning approaches that better suit their unique situations.
