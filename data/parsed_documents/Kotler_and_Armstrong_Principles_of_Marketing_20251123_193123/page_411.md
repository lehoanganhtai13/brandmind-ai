# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Merging the physical and digital worlds to create new-age experiential retailing environments. For example, at AT&T’s new flagship store in Chicago, customers can sit at any of dozens of stations, sampling the latest phone apps and electronic gadgetry. Enthusiastic, iPad-wielding associates mingle with customers, talking tech and dispensing hands-on help and advice. With 130 digital screens and an 18-foot video wall, every aspect of the open space is designed to engage customers about future wireless technologies and services and let them experience the impact of AT&T’s devices and services on their lives. It’s “like walking into a website,” says AT&T’s president of retail.³⁰

Many other advanced technologies are finding their way into retail showrooms. One is beacon technology, Bluetooth connections that greet and engage customers via their smartphones as they shop around in stores. For example, when opted-in customers enter a Macy’s store, a beacon signal wakes up an app on their smartphone or tablet, which welcomes them and alerts them to location-specific rewards, deals, discounts, and personalized product recommendations within the store. The technology can also link in-store and at-home browsing; if the customer “likes” a specific product online, the app can remind them where to find it in the store, pop up a brief product video, and maybe pass along a for-you-only deal. The goal is to engage Macy’s tech-savvy and social customers as a trusted companion and to personalize their in-store shopping experience.³¹

Other retailers are experimenting with *virtual reality* to enhance the in-store shopping experience. ● For example, customers at North Face’s Manhattan store can don virtual-reality headsets that transport them to remote hiking, climbing, or even base-jumping locations where they can experience gutsy jumps off a 420-foot cliff, all while using North Face gear. Marriott guests can put on virtual-reality goggles for up-close tours of destinations such as Hawaii or London. Intel has developed a “smart” dressing room in which shoppers can change outfits and colors with a wave of the hand. And automaker Audi is testing a virtual reality in dealer showrooms. Customers use iPads to select any Audi model and then customize each element, from engine type and wheels to paint color and interior seats. They then put on a headset and earphones to experience the sights and sounds of their customized car in virtual reality. They can move around the outside of the car, open the trunk and doors, check under the hood, and even sit in the driver’s seat. Although virtual reality technologies are difficult and expensive to implement now, they hold interesting promise for the future.³²

## Green Retailing

Today’s retailers are increasingly adopting environmentally sustainable practices. They are greening up their stores and operations, promoting more environmentally responsible products, launching programs to help customers be more responsible, and working with channel partners to reduce their environmental impact.

At the most basic level, most large retailers are making their stores more environmentally friendly through sustainable building design, construction, and operations. ● For example, under its “People & Planet Positive” sustainability strategy, home furnishings retailer IKEA’s long-term goal is to become 100 percent sustainable:³³

> The “People & Planet Positive” strategy begins with making IKEA’s 328 giant stores in 28 countries more energy independent and efficient. To power its stores, IKEA has committed to owning and operating 224 wind turbines and has installed 700,000 solar panels—90 percent of its U.S. stores have solar panels. By 2020, IKEA will generate as much energy as it uses from renewable sources. Inside its stores, IKEA uses only energy-efficient LED lighting. Most stores also sort food waste from in-store customer restaurants for composting or send it to treatment centers where it is turned into animal feed or biogas to fuel cars and buses. Some IKEAs offer customer recycling centers for products such as plastic, paper, CFL lightbulbs, batteries, and even end-of-life appliances.
