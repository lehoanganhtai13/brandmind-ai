The tweet contained a picture of baseball-decorated cupcakes but also the bold headline TOUCHDOWN. As expected, the tweet grabbed plenty of attention, as droves of Twitter followers pounced to point out the mistake, just the reaction Hostess intended. “The ‘touchdown’ line was intentional,” says the marketing director of Hostess Brands. “It’s fun and aimed at young audiences who are in on the running joke.”

Other brands have also “tested the stupid waters,” as one analyst puts it. For example, JCPenney once posted incoherent tweets, grabbing widespread attention and leading to speculation that the retailer’s social media person was either drunk or had been hacked. Instead, says JCPenney, the person was tweeting with mittens on to promote its winter merchandise. P&G’s Charmin brand’s #tweetfromtheseat Twitter campaign uses irreverent humor to create engagement and drive buzz, with questions such as “Charmin asks: What are your thoughts on streaming while streaming?” and “There’s no toilet paper left on the roll, do you yell for help, wiggle and air dry, text someone for help?”¹¹

*Brand integrations* (or *branded entertainment*) involve making the brand an inseparable part of some other form of entertainment or content. The most common form of brand integration is product placements—embedding brands as props within other programming. It might be a brief glimpse of Starbucks coffee products on *Morning Joe* on MSNBC or of Microsoft’s Surface tablet and Bing search engine in episodes of *Elementary* or *Arrow*. It could be scenes from *Avengers: Age of Ultron* in which Black Widow rides a Harley-Davidson Livewire.

Or the product placement might be scripted into a movie or an episode of a TV show. For example, a GoPro camera played a starring role opposite Matt Damon in the movie  
*The Martian*. And a three-episode story on the hit TV show *Empire* was built entirely around the making of a Pepsi commercial in which the character of Jamal, a rising singer, becomes the new face of Pepsi. Then Pepsi ran the actual ad during commercial breaks in subsequent episodes of the show. The *Empire* brand integration cost Pepsi an estimated $20 million.¹²

Similarly, a storyline in one episode of *Black-ish* was built around a Buick Encore, which characters Dre and Bow purchased for their daughter, Zoey. Dre lists all of the great features of the Enclave. However, after his work colleagues remind him of the riskier things teenagers do to and in cars, Dre has second thoughts about whether Zoey is really ready for a car. Dre’s mother, Ruby, feeds his concerns so that she can claim the car for her own. Ruby even posts a selfie with the car on her Facebook page, proclaiming, “Praise Jesus. That son of mine finally got his mother a Buick.” By the end of the episode, Zoey gets the car. Other *Black-ish* episodes feature storylines built around brands ranging State Farm to Chipotle.

Originally created with TV in mind, brand integration has spread quickly into other sectors of the entertainment industry. If you look carefully, you’ll see product placements in movies, video games, comic books, Broadway musicals, and even pop music. For example, last year’s top 31 movies contained 430 identifiable brand placements.¹³ The highly acclaimed film *The LEGO Movie* was pretty much a 100-minute product placement for iconic LEGO construction bricks. According to one writer, “The audience happily sits through a cinematic sales pitch . . . that shows off the immense versatility of the product while placing it in a deeply personal context. The majority of the film is a breathtaking display of what LEGO bricks are capable of as creative tools, but the personal element is what really elevates this film to product-placement perfection.” *The LEGO Movie* boosted The LEGO Group’s sales by 13 percent the year after it opened.¹⁴

A related form of brand integration is so-called **native advertising** (also called *sponsored content*), advertising or other brand-produced online content that appears to be
