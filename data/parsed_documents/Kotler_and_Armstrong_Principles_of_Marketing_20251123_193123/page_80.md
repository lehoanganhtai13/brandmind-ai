It holds that the four Ps concept takes the seller’s view of the market, not the buyer’s view. From the buyer’s viewpoint, in this age of customer value and relationships, the four Ps might be better described as the four As:12

This table presents a comparative framework, aligning the traditional "Four Ps" of marketing with a corresponding set of "Four As." The Four Ps, representing Product, Price, Place, and Promotion, are mapped to the Four As: Acceptability, Affordability, Accessibility, and Awareness, respectively. This structure suggests a customer-centric reinterpretation of marketing strategy, where each "P" is viewed through the lens of its corresponding "A." Product is considered in terms of its Acceptability to the target market; Price is evaluated for its Affordability; Place is assessed by its Accessibility to consumers; and Promotion is measured by the level of Awareness it generates. The overarching organization is a direct, one-to-one correspondence, illustrating how fundamental marketing elements can be reframed to emphasize consumer perception and engagement.

Under this more customer-centered framework, *acceptability* is the extent to which the product exceeds customer expectations; *affordability* the extent to which customers are willing and able to pay the product’s price; *accessibility* the extent to which customers can readily acquire the product; and *awareness* the extent to which customers are informed about the product’s features, persuaded to try it, and reminded to repurchase. The four As relate closely to the traditional four Ps. Product design influences acceptability, price affects affordability, place affects accessibility, and promotion influences awareness. Marketers would do well to think through the four As first and then build the four Ps on that platform.

# Managing the Marketing Effort and Marketing Return on Investment

## Managing the Marketing Effort

In addition to being good at the *marketing* in marketing management, companies also need to pay attention to the *management*. Managing the marketing process requires the five marketing management functions shown in the ● **Figure 2.6** — *analysis, planning, implementation, organization,* and *control*. The company first develops company-wide strategic plans and then translates them into marketing and other plans for each division, product, and brand. Through implementation and organization, the company turns the plans into actions. Control consists of measuring and evaluating the results of marketing activities and taking corrective action where needed. Finally, marketing analysis provides the information and evaluations needed for all the other marketing activities.

### Marketing Analysis

Managing the marketing function begins with a complete analysis of the company’s situation. The marketer should conduct a **SWOT analysis** (pronounced “swat” analysis), by

This table outlines a three-phase management process: Planning, Implementation and Organization, and Control. The Planning phase involves the development of strategic and marketing plans. The subsequent Implementation and Organization phase focuses on executing these developed plans. Finally, the Control phase encompasses measuring and evaluating the results of the implemented plans, with the ultimate goal of taking corrective action. This structure represents a cyclical, process-based approach to management, where planning informs execution, and control mechanisms provide feedback for future planning.

> We’ll close the chapter by looking at how marketers manage those strategies and plans—how they implement marketing strategies and programs and evaluate the results.
