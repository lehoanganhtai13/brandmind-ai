# 6.1 International Marketing Manners

thinks it’s time that the rest of the world enjoyed the same fine products it has offered American consumers for two generations. It dispatches Vice President Harry E. Slicksmile to Europe, Asia, and Africa to explore the territory. Mr. Slicksmile stops first in London, where he makes short work of some bankers—he rings them up on the phone. He handles Parisians with similar ease: After securing a table at La Tour d’Argent, he greets his luncheon guest, the director of an industrial engineering firm, with the words, “Just call me Harry, Jacques.” In Germany, Mr. Slicksmile is a powerhouse. Whisking through a flashy multimedia presentation on his iPad and an ultra-compact projector, he shows ’em that this Georgia boy knows how to make a buck.

Mr. Slicksmile next swings through Saudi Arabia, where he coolly presents a potential client with a multimillion-dollar proposal in a classy pigskin binder. Heading on to Moscow, Harry strikes up a conversation with the Japanese businessman sitting next to him on the plane. Harry compliments the man’s cuff links several times, recognizing him as a man of importance. As the two say good-bye, the man gifts his cuff links to Harry, presents his business card with both hands, and bows at the waist. Harry places his hand firmly on the man’s back to express sincere thanks, then slips his own business card into the man’s shirt pocket.

Harry takes Russia by storm as he meets with the CEO of a start-up tech firm. Feeling very at ease with the Russia executive, Harry sheds his suit coat, leans back, crosses one foot over the other knee, and slips his hands into his pockets. At his next stop in Beijing, China, Harry talks business over lunch with a group of Chinese executives. After completing the meal, he drops his chopsticks into his bowl of rice and presents each guest with a gift as a gesture of his desire to do business with them—an elegant Tiffany clock.

A great tour, sure to generate a pile of orders, right? Wrong. Six months later, Consolidated Amalgamation has nothing to show for the extended trip but a stack of bills. Abroad, they weren’t wild about Harry.

This hypothetical case has been exaggerated for emphasis. Americans are seldom such dolts. But experts say success in international business has a lot to do with knowing the territory and its people. By learning English and extending themselves in other ways, the world’s business leaders have met Americans more than halfway. In contrast, Americans too often do little except assume that others will march to their music. “We want things to be ‘American’ when we travel. Fast. Convenient. Easy. So we become ‘ugly Americans’ by demanding that others change,” says one American world trade expert. “I think more business would be done if we tried harder.”

Poor Harry tried, all right, but in all the wrong ways. The British do not, as a rule, make deals over the phone as much as Americans do. It’s not so much a “cultural” difference as a difference in approach. A proper Frenchman neither likes instant familiarity nor refers to strangers by their first names. “That poor fellow, Jacques, probably wouldn’t show anything, but he’d not be pleased,” explains an expert on French business practices.

Harry’s flashy presentation would likely have been a flop with the Germans, who dislike overstatement and showiness. And to the Saudi Arabians, the pigskin binder would have been considered vile. An American salesperson who actually presented such a binder was unceremoniously tossed out of the country and his company was blacklisted from working with Saudi businesses.

Harry also committed numerous faux pas with his new Japanese acquaintance. Because the Japanese strive to please others, especially when someone admires their possessions, the executive likely felt obligated rather than pleased to give up his cuff links. Harry’s “hand on the back” probably labeled him as disrespectful and presumptuous. Japan, like many Asian countries, is a “no-contact culture” in which even shaking hands is a strange experience. Harry made matters worse with his casual treatment of the business cards. Japanese people revere the business card as an extension of self and as an indicator of rank. They do not hand it to people; they present it—with both hands.

Things didn’t go well in Russia, either. Russian businesspeople maintain a conservative, professional appearance, with dark suits and dress shoes. Taking one’s coat off during negotiations of any kind is taken as a sign of weakness. Placing hands in one’s pockets is considered rude, and showing the bottoms of one’s shoes is a disgusting gesture. Similarly, in China, Harry casually dropping his chopsticks could have been misinterpreted as an act of aggression. Stabbing chopsticks into a bowl of rice and leaving them signifies death to the Chinese.
