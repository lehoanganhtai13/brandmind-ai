$$
\text{New contribution margin} \times \text{new sales level} = \text{original total contribution}
$$

So,

$$
\text{New sales level} = \frac{\text{original contribution}}{\text{new contribution margin}} = \frac{21,000,000}{0.12} = 175,000,000
$$

Thus, sales must increase by $75 million ($175 million − $100 million) just to break even on a 10% price reduction. This means that HD must increase market share to 7% ($175 million ÷ $2.5 billion) to achieve the current level of profits (assuming no increase in the total market sales). The marketing manager must assess whether or not this is a reasonable goal.

## Extend the Product Line

As a final option, HD is considering extending its product line by offering a lower-priced model. Of course, the new, lower-priced product would steal some sales from the higher-priced model. This is called **cannibalization**—the situation in which one product sold by a company takes a portion of its sales from other company products. If the new product has a lower contribution than the original product, the company’s total contribution will decrease on the cannibalized sales. However, if the new product can generate enough new volume, it is worth considering.

To assess cannibalization, HD must look at the incremental contribution gained by having both products available. Recall in the previous analysis we determined that unit variable costs were $132.72 and unit contribution was just over $35. Assuming costs remain the same next year, HD can expect to realize a contribution per unit of approximately $35 for every unit of the original product sold.

Assume that the first model offered by HD is called HD1 and the new, lower-priced model is called HD2. HD2 will retail for $250, and resellers will take the same markup percentages on price as they do with the higher-priced model. Therefore, HD2’s price to wholesalers will be $140 as follows:

This data illustrates a cost breakdown for a product, demonstrating a sequential reduction in price through different distribution channels. It begins with the initial Retail price of $250. A Retail margin of 30% is then subtracted, resulting in a reduction of $75. This leads to the Retailer’s cost, which is also identified as the Wholesaler’s price, standing at $175. Subsequently, a Wholesaler’s margin of 20% is applied, subtracting $35 from the price. The final figure presented is the Wholesaler’s cost, also termed HD’s price, which is $140. The structure is comparative, showing how the price is successively lowered by margins at each stage of the supply chain.

If HD2’s variable costs are estimated to be $120, then its contribution per unit will equal $20 ($140 − $120 = $20). That means for every unit that HD2 cannibalizes from HD1, HD will lose $15 in contribution toward fixed costs and profit (that is,  
$$
\text{contribution}_{HD2} - \text{contribution}_{HD1} = 20 - 35 = -15
$$
). You might conclude that HD should not pursue this tactic because it appears as though the company will be worse off if it introduces the lower-priced model. However, if HD2 captures enough *additional* sales, HD will be better off even though some HD1 sales are cannibalized. The company must examine what will happen to *total* contribution, which requires estimates of unit volume for both products.

Originally, HD estimated that next year’s sales of HD1 would be 600,000 units. However, with the introduction of HD2, it now estimates that 200,000 of those sales will be cannibalized by the new model. If HD sells only 200,000 units of the new HD2 model (all cannibalized from HD1), the company would lose $3 million in total contribution (200,000 units × −$15 per cannibalized unit = −$3 million)—not a good outcome.
