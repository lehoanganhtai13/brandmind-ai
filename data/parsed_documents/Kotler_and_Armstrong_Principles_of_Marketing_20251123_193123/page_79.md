Ford offers several Escape models and dozens of optional features. The car comes fully serviced and with a comprehensive warranty that is as much a part of the product as the tailpipe.  
* **Price** is the amount of money customers must pay to obtain the product. For example, Ford calculates suggested retail prices that its dealers might charge for each Escape. But Ford dealers rarely charge the full sticker price. Instead, they negotiate the price with each customer, offering discounts, trade-in allowances, and credit terms. These actions adjust prices for the current competitive and economic situations and bring them into line with the buyer’s perception of the car’s value.  
* **Place** includes company activities that make the product available to target consumers. Ford partners with a large body of independently owned dealerships that sell the company’s many different models. Ford selects its dealers carefully and strongly supports them. The dealers keep an inventory of Ford automobiles, demonstrate them to potential buyers, negotiate prices, close sales, and service the cars after the sale.  
* **Promotion** refers to activities that communicate the merits of the product and persuade target customers to buy it. Ford spends nearly $2.5 billion each year on U.S. advertising to tell consumers about the company and its many products.¹¹ Dealership salespeople assist potential buyers and persuade them that Ford is the best car for them. Ford and its dealers offer special promotions—sales, cash rebates, and low financing rates—as added purchase incentives. And Ford’s Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms engage consumers with the brand and with other brand fans.

An effective marketing program blends the marketing mix elements into an integrated marketing program designed to achieve the company’s marketing objectives by engaging consumers and delivering value to them. The marketing mix constitutes the company’s tactical tool kit for establishing strong positioning in target markets.  

Some critics think that the four Ps may omit or underemphasize certain important activities. For example, they ask, “Where are services? Just because they don’t start with a P doesn’t justify omitting them.” The answer is that services, such as banking, airline, and retailing services, are products too. We might call them *service products*. “Where is packaging?” the critics might ask. Marketers would answer that they include packaging as one of many product decisions. All said, as Figure 2.5 suggests, many marketing activities that might appear to be left out of the marketing mix are included under one of the four Ps. The issue is not whether there should be four, six, or ten Ps so much as what framework is most helpful in designing integrated marketing programs.

Figure 2.5 illustrates the Four Ps of the Marketing Mix, a framework of tactical marketing tools designed to engage target customers and deliver intended customer value. The four core components are Product, Price, Promotion, and Place. Product encompasses aspects such as variety, quality, design, features, brand name, packaging, and services. Price includes list price, discounts, allowances, payment periods, and credit terms. Promotion comprises advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, and direct and digital marketing efforts. Place involves channels, coverage, locations, inventory, transportation, and logistics. The overarching goal of these integrated elements is to achieve target customer engagement and establish intended positioning. There is another concern, however, that is valid.
