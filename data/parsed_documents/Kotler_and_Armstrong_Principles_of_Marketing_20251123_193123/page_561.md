## Evolving Company Orientations

This table presents a framework for understanding different market orientations based on two dimensions: customer-centeredness and competitor-centeredness. The structure is a 2x2 matrix, categorizing orientations into four distinct types. When a company is not customer-centered and not competitor-centered, it exhibits a product orientation, focusing primarily on its offerings. If a company is not customer-centered but is competitor-centered, it adopts a competitor orientation, emphasizing rivals' actions. Conversely, a company that is customer-centered but not competitor-centered demonstrates a customer orientation, prioritizing customer needs and satisfaction. Finally, when a company is both customer-centered and competitor-centered, it achieves a market orientation, integrating insights from both customers and competitors to guide its strategies. This matrix highlights how the interplay of these two focus areas defines a company's strategic approach to the market.

> Market-centered companies understand both customers and competitors. They build profitable customer relationships by delivering more customer value than competitors do.

**Competitor-centered company**  
A company whose moves are mainly based on competitors’ actions and reactions.

**Customer-centered company**  
A company that focuses on customer developments in designing its marketing strategies and delivering superior value to its target customers.

**Market-centered company**  
A company that pays balanced attention to both customers and competitors in designing its marketing strategies.

environment. This question now arises: Can the company spend *too* much time and energy tracking competitors, damaging its customer orientation? The answer is yes. A company can become so competitor centered that it loses its even more important focus on maintaining profitable customer relationships.

A **competitor-centered company** is one that spends most of its time tracking competitors’ moves and market shares and trying to find strategies to counter them. This approach has some pluses and minuses. On the positive side, the company develops a fighter orientation, watches for weaknesses in its own position, and searches out competitors’ weaknesses. On the negative side, the company becomes too reactive. Rather than carrying out its own customer relationship strategy, it bases its own moves on competitors’ moves. As a result, it may end up simply matching or extending industry practices rather than seeking innovative new ways to create more value for customers.

A **customer-centered company**, by contrast, focuses more on customer developments in designing its strategies. Clearly, the customer-centered company is in a better position to identify new opportunities and set long-run strategies that make sense. By watching customer needs evolve, it can decide what customer groups and what emerging needs are the most important to serve. Then it can concentrate its resources on delivering superior value to target customers.

In practice, today’s companies must be **market-centered companies**, watching both their customers and their competitors. But they must not let competitor watching blind them to customer focusing.

**Figure 18.3** shows that companies might have any of four orientations. First, they might be product oriented, paying little attention to either customers or competitors. Next, they might be customer oriented, paying attention to customers. In the third orientation, when a company starts to pay attention to competitors, it becomes competitor oriented. Today, however, companies need to be market oriented, paying balanced attention to both customers and competitors. Rather than simply watching competitors and trying to beat them on current ways of doing business, they need to watch customers and find innovative ways to build profitable customer relationships by delivering more customer value than competitors do.

# 18 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review  
Today’s companies face their toughest competition ever. Understanding customers is an important first step in developing strong customer relationships, but it’s not enough. To gain competitive advantage, companies must use this understanding to design market offers that deliver more value than the offers of competitors seeking to win over the same customers. This chapter examines how firms analyze their competitors and design effective competitive marketing strategies.

### OBJECTIVE 18-1  
**Discuss the need to understand competitors as well as customers through competitor analysis.** _(pp 542–549)_

To prepare an effective marketing strategy, a company must consider its competitors as well as its customers. Building profitable customer relationships requires satisfying target consumer needs better than competitors do. A company must continuously analyze competitors and develop competitive marketing strategies that position it effectively against Competitors and give it the strongest possible competitive advantage.
