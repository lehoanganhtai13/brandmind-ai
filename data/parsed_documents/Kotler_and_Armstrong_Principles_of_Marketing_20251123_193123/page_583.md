and Tanzania. The properties are locally owned, but Hilton manages the hotels with its world-renowned hospitality expertise.32  
Management contracting is a low-risk method of getting into a foreign market, and it yields income from the beginning. The arrangement is even more attractive if the contracting firm has an option to buy some share in the managed company later on. The arrangement is not sensible, however, if the company can put its scarce management talent to better uses or if it can make greater profits by undertaking the whole venture. Management contracting also prevents the company from setting up its own operations for a period of time.

# Joint Ownership

**Joint ownership** ventures consist of one company joining forces with foreign investors to create a local business in which they share possession and control. A company may buy an interest in a local firm, or the two parties may form a new business venture. Joint ownership may be needed for economic or political reasons. For example, the firm may lack the financial, physical, or managerial resources to undertake the venture alone. Alternatively, a foreign government may require joint ownership as a condition for entry. Disney’s Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland are both joint ownership ventures with the Chinese government-owned Shanghai Shendi Group. Disney owns 43 percent of the Shanghai resort; the Shanghai Shendi Group owns 57 percent.33

Often, companies form joint ownership ventures to merge their complementary strengths in developing a global marketing opportunity.  
● For example, to increase its presence and local influence in China’s mobile phone and tablets markets, chipmaker Intel recently paid $1.5 billion for 20 percent ownership in China’s state-run Tsinghua Unigroup, which controls two domestic mobile chipmakers. The joint ownership investment will help Intel to better understand Chinese consumers. It may also help to earn more favorable treatment from Chinese regulators. So far, Intel has gone untouched by China’s recent crackdown on foreign technology companies such as competitor Qualcomm and software makers Microsoft and Symantec.34

Joint ownership has certain drawbacks, however. The partners may disagree over investment, marketing, or other policies. Whereas many U.S. firms like to reinvest earnings for growth, local firms often prefer to take out these earnings; whereas U.S. firms emphasize the role of marketing, local investors may rely on selling.

# Direct Investment

The biggest involvement in a foreign market comes through **direct investment**—the development of foreign-based assembly or manufacturing facilities. For example, in addition to joint ownership ventures in China, Intel has also made substantial investments in its own manufacturing and research facilities there. It recently spent $1.6 billion upgrading its decade-old chip factory in the central Chinese city of Chengdu and another $2.5 billion to build a shiny new fabrication plant in Dalian, a port city in China’s northeast. “China is our fastest-growing major market,” says Intel’s CEO, “and we believe it’s critical that we invest in markets that will provide for future growth to better serve our customers.”35

If a company has gained experience in exporting and if the foreign market is large enough, foreign production facilities offer many advantages. The firm may have lower costs in the form of cheaper labor or raw materials, foreign government investment incentives, and freight savings. The firm may also improve its image in the host country because it creates jobs. Generally, a firm develops a deeper relationship with the government, customers, local suppliers, and distributors, allowing it to adapt its products to the local market better. Finally, the firm keeps full control over the investment and therefore can develop manufacturing and marketing policies that serve its long-term international objectives.

The main disadvantage of direct investment is that the firm faces many risks, such as restricted or devalued currencies, falling markets, or government changes. In some cases, a firm has no choice but to accept these risks if it wants to operate in the host country.
