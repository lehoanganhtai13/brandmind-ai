# New Retail Forms, Shortening Retail Life Cycles, and Retail Convergence

Department stores took about 100 years to reach the mature stage of the life cycle; more recent forms, such as warehouse stores, reached maturity in about 10 years. In such an environment, seemingly solid retail positions can crumble quickly. Of the top 10 discount retailers in 1962 (the year that the first Walmart, Kmart, Target, and Kohl’s stores opened), not one still exists today. Even the most successful retailers can’t sit back with a winning formula. To remain successful, they must keep adapting.

New retail forms are always emerging. One of the most recent blockbuster retailing trends is the advent of online retailing, by both online-only and store retailers, via websites, mobile apps, and social media. But lesser innovations occur regularly. For example, many retailers are now using limited-time *pop-up stores* that let them promote their brands to seasonal shoppers and create buzz in busy, high-rent areas. As an example, during an NBA All-Star weekend at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, Nike opened a Jordan-themed pop-up shop across the street. ● And Nordstrom offers monthly The Pop-In@ Nordstrom shops, specially designed in-store pop-up shops featuring rotating themes, new and exclusive products, and brand partnerships meant to create experiences that excite and intrigue customers. “I love the frenzy that’s created from a pop-up shop concept—that spontaneity and emotion is one of my favorite things about working in retail,” says Nordstrom’s director of creative projects.²²

The online and mobile equivalent is *flash sales* sites, such as Nordstrom’s HauteLook and Amazon’s MyHabit, which host time-limited sales events on top fashion and lifestyle brands. Similarly, Gilt.com flashes member-only, 70 percent discounts on designer-label clothing, and Groupon offers flash deals on travel through Groupon Getaways. Zulily flashes sales on products for moms, babies, and kids, offering limited-time sales “events” that quickly “scoot away to make room for new events.” Flash sales add excitement and urgency to buying. Says Zulily, “Shopping here is like opening a new treasure chest every day. You never know exactly what you’ll uncover, but you know gems are waiting.”²³

Today’s retail forms appear to be converging. Increasingly, different types of retailers now sell the same products at the same prices to the same consumers thanks in part to the price transparency the internet provides. For example, you can buy brand name home appliances at department stores, discount stores, home-improvement stores, off-price retailers, electronics superstores, and a slew of online sites that all compete for the same customers. If you can’t find the microwave oven you want at Sears or Lowe’s, you can step across the street and find one for a better price at Target or Best Buy—or just order one online from Amazon.com. This merging of consumers, products, prices, and retailers is called *retail convergence*. Such convergence means greater competition for retailers and greater difficulty in differentiating the product assortments of different types of retailers.

# The Rise of Megaretailers

The rise of huge mass merchandisers and specialty superstores, the formation of vertical marketing systems, and a rash of retail mergers and acquisitions have created a core of superpower megaretailers. With their size and buying power, these giant retailers can offer better merchandise selections, good service, and strong price savings to consumers. As a result, they grow even larger by squeezing out their smaller, weaker competitors.

The megaretailers have shifted the balance of power between retailers and producers. A small handful of retailers now controls access to enormous numbers of consumers, giving them the upper hand in their dealings with manufacturers. For example, you may never have heard of specialty coatings and sealants manufacturer RPM International, but you’ve probably used one or more of its many familiar do-it-yourself brands—such as Rust-Oleum paints, Plastic Wood and Dap fillers, Mohawk and Watco finishes, and Testors hobby cements and paints—all of which you can buy at your local Home Depot store.
