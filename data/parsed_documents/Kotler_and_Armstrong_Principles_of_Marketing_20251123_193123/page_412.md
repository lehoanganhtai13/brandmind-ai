# Retailing and Wholesaling

Retailers are also greening up their product assortments. For example, IKEA now sells only LED lighting products in its stores, and a growing proportion of the home furnishing products it sells are made from sustainable and renewable cotton, wood, and other resources. IKEA suppliers must adhere to the retailer’s IWAY supplier code of conduct sustainability standards. IKEA’s goal is have all of its home furnishings made from renewable, recyclable, or recycled materials. “At IKEA, sustainability is central to our business,” says the company, “to ensure that we have a positive impact on people and the planet.”

Many retailers have also launched programs that help consumers make more environmentally responsible decisions. Staples’s Easy on the Planet program “makes it easier to make a difference” by helping customers to identify green products sold in its stores and to recycle printer cartridges, mobile phones, computers, and other office technology products. Staples recycles some 30 million printer cartridges and 10 million pounds of old technology each year.

Finally, many large retailers are joining forces with suppliers and distributors to create more sustainable products, packaging, and distribution systems. For example, Amazon.com works closely with the producers of many of the products it sells to reduce and simplify their packaging. And beyond its own substantial sustainability initiatives, Walmart wields its huge buying power to urge its army of suppliers to improve their environmental impact and practices. The retailer has even developed a worldwide Sustainable Product Index by which it rates suppliers. It plans to translate the index into a simple rating for consumers to help them make more sustainable buying choices.

Green retailing yields both top- and bottom-line benefits. Sustainable practices lift a retailer’s top line by attracting consumers looking to support environmentally friendly sellers and products. They also help the bottom line by reducing costs. For example, Amazon.com’s reduced-packaging efforts increase customer convenience and eliminate “wrap rage” while at the same time saving packaging costs. And IKEA’s more energy-efficient buildings not only appeal to customers and help save the planet but also cost less to operate.

## Global Expansion of Major Retailers

Retailers with unique formats and strong brand positions are increasingly moving into other countries. Many are expanding internationally to escape saturated home markets. Over the years, some giant U.S. retailers, such as McDonald’s and Walmart, have become globally prominent as a result of their marketing prowess.

However, some U.S. retailers are still significantly behind Europe and Asia when it comes to global expansion. Although nine of the world’s top 20 retailers are U.S. companies, only six of these retailers have set up operations outside North America (Walmart, Home Depot, Walgreens, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy). Of the 11 non-U.S. retailers in the world’s top 20, 10 have stores in at least 10 countries. Foreign retailers that have gone global include France’s Carrefour, Groupe Casino, and Groupe Auchan; Germany’s Metro, Lidl, and ALDI chains; Britain’s Tesco; and Japan’s Seven & I.

International retailing presents challenges as well as opportunities. Retailers can face dramatically different retail environments when crossing countries, continents, and cultures. Simply adapting the operations that work well in the home country is usually not enough to create success abroad. Instead, when going global, retailers must understand and meet the needs of local markets.

> Whereas retailers primarily sell goods and services directly to final consumers for personal use, wholesalers sell primarily to those buying for resale or business use. Because wholesalers operate behind the scenes, they are largely unknown to final consumers. But they are very important to their business customers.

## Wholesaling

**Wholesaling** includes all the activities involved in selling goods and services to those buying them for resale or business use. Firms engaged *primarily* in wholesaling activities are called **wholesalers**.

Wholesalers buy mostly from producers and sell mostly to retailers, industrial consumers, and other wholesalers. As a result, many of the nation’s largest and most important wholesalers are largely unknown to final consumers. For example, how much do you know about McKesson, the huge $179 billion diversified health-care-services provider and the nation’s leading wholesaler of pharmaceutical, health and beauty care, home health-
