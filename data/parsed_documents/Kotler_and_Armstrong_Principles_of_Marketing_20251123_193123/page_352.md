# Pricing Strategies: Additional Considerations

A second strategy is **segmented pricing**, where the company sells a product at two or more prices to accommodate different customers, product forms, locations, or times. Sometimes companies consider more than economics in their pricing decisions, using **psychological pricing** to better communicate a product’s intended position. In **promotional pricing**, a company offers discounts or temporarily sells a product below list price as a special event, sometimes even selling below cost as a loss leader. Another approach is **geographical pricing**, whereby the company decides how to price to distant customers, choosing from such alternatives as FOB-origin pricing, uniform-delivered pricing, zone pricing, basing-point pricing, and freight-absorption pricing. Using **dynamic pricing**, a company can adjust prices continually to meet the characteristics and needs of individual customers and situations. Finally, **international pricing** means that the company adjusts its price to meet different conditions and expectations in different world markets.

## OBJECTIVE 11-4  
**Discuss the key issues related to initiating and responding to price changes.** _(pp 344–346)_

When a firm considers initiating a *price change*, it must consider customers’ and competitors’ reactions. There are different implications to *initiating price cuts* and *initiating price increases*. Buyer reactions to price changes are influenced by the meaning customers see in the price change. Competitors’ reactions flow from a set reaction policy or a fresh analysis of each situation.

There are also many factors to consider in responding to a competitor’s price changes. The company that faces a price change initiated by a competitor must try to understand the competitor’s intent as well as the likely duration and impact of the change. If a swift reaction is desirable, the firm should preplan its reactions to different possible price actions by competitors. When facing a competitor’s price change, the company might sit tight, reduce its own price, raise perceived quality, improve quality and raise price, or launch a fighter brand.

## OBJECTIVE 11-5  
**Overview the social and legal issues that affect pricing decisions.** _(pp 346–350)_

Many federal, state, and even local laws govern the rules of fair pricing. Also, companies must consider broader societal pricing concerns. The major public policy issues in pricing include potentially damaging pricing practices *within* a given level of the channel, such as price-fixing and predatory pricing. They also include pricing practices *across* channel levels, such as retail price maintenance, discriminatory pricing, and deceptive pricing. Although many federal and state statutes regulate pricing practices, reputable sellers go beyond what is required by law. Treating customers fairly is an important part of building strong and lasting customer relationships.
