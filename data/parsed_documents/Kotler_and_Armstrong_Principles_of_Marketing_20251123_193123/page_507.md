# Marketing Ethics  Walking the Customer

According to *The New York Times*, Staples maintains an internal reporting system nicknamed “Market Basket” that carefully tracks all equipment and protection plan add-ons that each sales staff member sells. Staples expects that each salesperson will upsell each transaction by $200 with additional merchandise and warranty contracts. Staples salespeople have been trained to push until they get at least three objections. This is a classic hard-sell technique. Sales staff who do not meet their goals are coached. If that doesn’t work, the underperforming employees face disciplinary action that can lead to more night and weekend shifts, reduced work hours, or even termination.

Store managers also face intense scrutiny. They have received a clear message that to avoid bringing down a store’s Market Basket averages, salespeople should “walk the customer” if they cannot be successfully upsold. The customer is informed that the merchandise is not in stock and then leave the store empty-handed. Salespeople have another option: They can escort customers to an in-store kiosk to place an online order. Online orders are not subject to Staples’s key performance indicators (KPI) and are not reported to a store’s Market Basket.

**16-11** A company’s sales force creates and communicates customer value by personally engaging customers and building customer relationships. With its Market Basket approach, was Staples focusing on building customer value and relationships? Explain.

**16-12** Read Staples’s code of ethics at www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/staples_soul/documents/staples-code-of-ethics_english.pdf. Is the situation outlined above consistent with Staples’s ethics policies? Is “walking the customer” a violation of the ethics code? Provide specific examples.

# Marketing by the Numbers  Sales Force Analysis

Wheels, Inc. is a manufacturer of bicycles sold through retail bicycle shops in the southeastern United States. The company has two salespeople that do more than just sell the products—they manage relationships with the bicycle shops to enable them to better meet consumers’ needs. The company’s sales reps visit the shops several times per year, often for hours at a time. The owner of Wheels is considering expanding to the rest of the country and would like to have distribution through 1,000 bicycle shops. To do so, however, the company would have to hire more salespeople. Each salesperson earns $40,000 plus 2 percent commission on all sales. Another alternative is to use the services of sales agents instead of its own sales force. Sales agents would be paid 5 percent of sales.

**16-13** Refer to Appendix 2 to answer this question. Determine the number of salespeople Wheels needs if it has 1,000 bicycle shop accounts that need to be called on four times per year. Each sales call lasts approximately 2.5 hours, and each sales rep has approximately 1,250 hours per year to devote to customers. (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

**16-14** At what level of sales would it be more cost efficient for Wheels to use sales agents compared with its own sales force? To determine this, consider the fixed and variable costs for each alternative. What are the pros and cons of using a company’s own sales force over independent sales agents? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)

# Video Case  First Flavor

First Flavor is a start-up company with a unique product. It manufactures great-tasting edible film that can replicate the flavor of just about anything, from an eight-topping pizza to an alcoholic beverage. If you’re wondering why a company would make such a product, think of the endless possibilities it allows for consumers to sample the taste of a food or beverage before purchasing it.

Although First Flavor first replicated flavors on thin film in order to market the product as a new method for product sampling, the company is now evaluating many other applications of the technology. This video demonstrates how one product can be marketed in multiple ways.

After viewing the video featuring First Flavor, answer the following questions:

**16-15** Classify First Flavor’s core business as a sales promotion element.

**16-16** Brainstorm a list of the ways that First Flavor’s edible film might be used to sample products.

**16-17** Can First Flavor successfully pursue consumer product opportunities in addition to its promotional services? Explain.

# Company Case  SunGard: Building Sustained Growth by Selling the SunGard Way

If asked what company topped the most recent *Selling Power* magazine list of 50 Best Companies to Sell For, you’d probably guess IBM, P&G, or maybe Xerox, companies long known for their outstanding sales forces. But number one on this year’s list is a company you probably know less about—software and technology services company SunGard.

What makes SunGard such a good place to work as a salesperson? For starters, SunGard has strong name recognition and a solid reputation in its industry. SunGard has long provided excellent compensation and training to its salespeople. And the company has consistently delivered strong customer growth and retention. However, although SunGard has long been good In the late 1970s, the computer services division of the Sun Oil Company (today Sunoco) pioneered a service now considered indispensable by virtually every company in the world.
