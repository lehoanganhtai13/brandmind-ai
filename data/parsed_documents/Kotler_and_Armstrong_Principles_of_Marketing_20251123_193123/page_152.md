# Critical Thinking Exercises

Discuss whether the business would be best advised to have someone do the research for them, or do it themselves. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

- **4-7** Suppose you are conducting market research for your favorite soda brand. Sales have been lagging for two quarters, and you are determined to find out why. You decide to host an in-person focus group to gain customer insights into your brand’s current product offerings. You are also interested in obtaining feedback on a new product that your brand plans to launch in the next six months. Determine the makeup of your focus group. Who should be invited to the focus group, and why? What types of information would you want to obtain? Identify possible questions to present to the focus group. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

- **4-8** Conduct an online search to learn more about the marketing research industry. Develop a presentation describing the variety of jobs in the marketing research field along with the compensation for those jobs. Create a graphical representation to communicate your findings. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)

# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### Online Snooping

Every second of every day, personal information is being indexed and processed. Every device we use has a unique address which is being broadcast as long as you have wireless networking switched on. Many of us do not even realize that programs exist to find every picture you may have ever posted online. They can also pinpoint exactly where you were when you uploaded them. If you haven’t set the right privacy settings, it will become fairly easy to work out exactly where you live, your habits, and when you are at home and when you are out. Some services are specifically designed to scare people about the information they are unintentionally leaking to the world, such as pleaserobme.com. This shows you whether you are sharing your location and prompts you to change your privacy settings.

- **4-9** Make a detailed list of all the websites, online forums, social networks, and other web pages you have visited this week. What data have you left that could be of value to marketers? (AACSB: Communication; Information Technology)

- **4-10** Monetizing relevant data is the key to revealing its true value. Should marketers have access to the personal information of billions of people who use the internet? Discuss how you would use data trails left by individuals on the internet if you ran a business. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical reasoning)

## Marketing Ethics  
### Metadata

Everyone generates metadata when using technologies such as computers and mobile devices to search, post, tweet, play, text, and talk. What many people don’t realize, however, is that this treasure trove of date, time, and location information can be used to identify them without their knowledge. For example, in analyzing more than a million anonymous credit card transactions, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were able to link 90 percent of the transactions to specific users with just four additional bits of metadata, such as user locations based on apps such as Foursquare, the timing of an activity such as a tweet on Twitter, or playing a mobile game. Since there are more mobile devices than there are people in the United States and 60 percent of purchases are made with a credit card, marketing research firms are gobbling up all sorts of metadata that will let them tie a majority of purchase transactions to specific individuals.

- **4-11** Describe at least four applications you use that provide location, time, and date information that can be tied to your identity. (AACSB Communication; Reflective Thinking)

- **4-12** Debate whether it is ethical for marketers to use metadata to link individual consumers with specific credit card transactions. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning)

## Marketing by the Numbers  
### What’s Your Sample?

Decisions are often made by businesses on the basis of fairly small samples in relation to the actual size of the population or number of customers. Thus, the future of products and services is often determined by relatively small numbers of people. But just how reliable are small-scale samples? Larger samples cost more money; they take more time and ultimately may not be any more accurate than a smaller sample. Are businesses and organizations right to rely so heavily on these small samples?
