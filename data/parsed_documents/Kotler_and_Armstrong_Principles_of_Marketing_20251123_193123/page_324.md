If demand is elastic rather than inelastic, sellers will consider lowering their prices.  
A lower price will produce more total revenue. This practice makes sense as long as the extra costs of producing and selling more do not exceed the extra revenue. At the same time, most firms want to avoid pricing that turns their products into commodities. In recent years, forces such as deregulation and the instant price comparisons afforded by the internet and other technologies have increased consumer price sensitivity, turning products ranging from phones and computers to new automobiles into commodities in some consumers’ eyes.

## The Economy  
Economic conditions can have a strong impact on the firm’s pricing strategies. Economic factors such as a boom or recession, inflation, and interest rates affect pricing decisions because they affect consumer spending, consumer perceptions of the product’s price and value, and the company’s costs of producing and selling a product.  
In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, many consumers rethought the price-value equation. They tightened their belts and become more value conscious. Consumers have continued their thriftier ways well beyond the economic recovery. As a result, many marketers have increased their emphasis on value-for-the-money pricing strategies.  
The most obvious response to the new economic realities is to cut prices and offer discounts. Thousands of companies have done just that. Lower prices make products more affordable and help spur short-term sales. However, such price cuts can have undesirable long-term consequences. Lower prices mean lower margins. Deep discounts may cheapen a brand in consumers’ eyes. And once a company cuts prices, it’s difficult to raise them again when the economy recovers.  
Rather than cutting prices on their main-market brands, many companies are holding their price positions but redefining the “value” in their value propositions. Other companies have developed “price tiers,” adding both more affordable lines and premium lines that span the varied means and preferences of different customer segments. For example, for cost-conscious customers with tighter budgets, P&G has added lower-price versions of its brands, such as “Basic” versions of Bounty and Charmin and a lower-priced version of Tide called Tide Simply Clean and Fresh. At the same time, at the higher end, P&G has launched upscale versions of some of its brands, such as Bounty DuraTowel and Cascade Platinum dishwasher detergent, which offer superior performance at up to twice the price of the middle-market versions.  
Remember, even in tough economic times, consumers do not buy based on prices alone. They balance the price they pay against the value they receive. For example, despite selling its shoes for as much as $150 a pair, Nike commands the highest consumer loyalty of any brand in the footwear segment. Customers perceive the value of Nike’s products and the Nike ownership experience to be well worth the price. Thus, no matter what price they charge—low or high—companies need to offer great *value for the money*.

## Other External Factors  
Beyond the market and the economy, the company must consider several other factors in its external environment when setting prices. It must know what impact its prices will have on other parties in its environment. How will *resellers* react to various prices? The company should set prices that give resellers a fair profit, encourage their support, and help them to sell the product effectively. The *government* is another important external influence on pricing decisions. Finally, *social concerns* may need to be taken into account.  
In setting prices, a company’s short-term sales, market share, and profit goals may need to be tempered by broader societal considerations. We will examine public policy issues later in Chapter 11.
