# Problems with Matrix Approaches

The BCG and other formal methods revolutionized strategic planning. However, such centralized approaches have limitations: They can be difficult, time consuming, and costly to implement. Management may find it difficult to define SBUs and measure market share and growth. In addition, these approaches focus on classifying current businesses but provide little advice for future planning.

Because of such problems, many companies have dropped formal matrix methods in favor of more customized approaches that better suit their specific situations. Moreover, unlike former strategic planning efforts that rested mostly in the hands of senior managers at company headquarters, today’s strategic planning has been decentralized. Increasingly, companies are placing responsibility for strategic planning in the hands of cross-functional teams of divisional managers who are close to their markets. In this digital age, such managers have rich and current data at their fingertips and can adapt their plans quickly to meet changing conditions and events in their markets.

Portfolio planning can be challenging. For example, consider GE, the giant $117 billion industrial conglomerate operating with a broad portfolio of products in dozens of consumer and business markets:

> Most consumers know GE for its home appliance and lighting products, part of the company’s GE Lighting unit and former GE Appliances unit. But that’s just the beginning for GE. Other company units—such as GE Transportation, GE Aviation, GE Energy Connections, GE Power, GE Oil & Gas, GE Healthcare, and others—offer products and services ranging from jet engines, diesel-electric locomotives, wind turbines, and off-shore drilling solutions to aerospace systems and medical imaging equipment. GE Capital offers a breadth of financial products and services.  
> 
> However, in recent years, GE has been dramatically shifting its vast portfolio away from consumer products and financial services toward the goal of becoming a more focused “industrial infrastructure company,” one that’s on a mission to “invent the next digital industrial era, to build, move, power, and cure the world.”
> 
> Currently, less than 8 percent of GE’s annual revenues come from consumer products, and that percentage continues to dwindle. The company is now in the midst of selling off its huge GE Capital financial services arm, and it recently sold its entire GE Appliances division to Haier. Such portfolio decisions have huge implications for the company’s future. For example, prior to the sale of its appliances unit, GE’s appliance and lighting businesses alone generated more than $8.8 billion in annual revenues, more than the total revenues of companies such as JetBlue, Netflix, Harley-Davidson, or Hershey. Thus, successfully managing GE’s broad portfolio takes plenty of management skill and—as GE’s long-running corporate slogan suggests—lots of “Imagination at work.”

# Developing Strategies for Growth and Downsizing

Beyond evaluating current businesses, designing the business portfolio involves finding businesses and products the company should consider in the future. Companies need growth if they are to compete more effectively, satisfy their stakeholders, and attract top talent. At the same time, a firm must be careful not to make growth itself an objective. The company’s objective must be to manage “profitable growth.”

Marketing has the main responsibility for achieving profitable growth for the company. Marketing needs to identify, evaluate, and select market opportunities and lay down strategies for capturing them. One useful device for identifying growth opportunities is the **product/market expansion grid**, shown in Figure 2.3. We apply it here to performance sports apparel maker Under Armour.

> Less than 20 years ago, Under Armour introduced its innovative line of comfy, moisture-wicking performance shirts and shorts with the mission “to make all athletes better through passion, design, and the relentless pursuit of innovation.” Since then, it has grown at a torrid pace. In just the past five years, Under Armour’s sales have more than
