# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines the four major steps involved in designing a customer value-driven marketing strategy. These steps, presented in a sequential manner, begin with **market segmentation**, which involves dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers with different needs, characteristics, or behaviors. Following segmentation is **targeting**, where the company evaluates each market segment's attractiveness and selects one or more segments to enter. The third step is **differentiation**, which focuses on creating superior customer value by actually differentiating the market offering to create superior customer value. Finally, the strategy culminates in **positioning**, where the company positions its market offering in the minds of target consumers so that it stands out relative to competing offerings. Together, these four steps form a structured approach to developing an effective marketing strategy.
This content outlines Objective 7-2, focusing on listing and discussing the major bases for segmenting both consumer and business markets. The primary concept presented is *Market Segmentation*, with the associated page range indicating its detailed discussion from pages 213 to 221. The objective's structure suggests a comparative approach, examining segmentation strategies applicable to distinct market types: consumers and businesses. The core task involves identifying and elaborating on the fundamental criteria or variables used to divide these markets into smaller, more manageable groups, implying a hierarchical breakdown of market characteristics for targeted marketing efforts.
This content outlines Objective 7-3, focusing on how companies identify attractive market segments and subsequently select a market-targeting strategy. The primary concept discussed is "Market Targeting," with a page range reference indicating detailed coverage from pages 221 to 228. This objective and its associated topic suggest a process-oriented structure, where the initial step involves the identification and evaluation of potential market segments, leading to the strategic decision of which segments to target for marketing efforts. The emphasis is on the analytical and strategic aspects of market selection within a broader marketing framework.
This content outlines Objective 7-4, focusing on how companies achieve competitive advantage through product differentiation and positioning. The objective encompasses a discussion of strategies and tactics employed by businesses to distinguish their offerings in the marketplace and establish a distinct place in the minds of target consumers. This involves understanding the core concepts of differentiation, which relates to making a product unique and superior to competitors, and positioning, which concerns how that unique value proposition is communicated and perceived. The scope of this objective, as indicated by the page references, suggests a detailed exploration of the theoretical frameworks and practical applications of these marketing principles.

**COMPANIES TODAY RECOGNIZE THAT** they cannot appeal to all buyers in the marketplace—or at least not to all buyers in the same way. Buyers are too numerous, widely scattered, and varied in their needs and buying practices. Moreover, companies themselves vary widely in their abilities to serve different market segments. Instead, like Henkel, companies must identify the parts of the market they can serve best and most profitably. They must design customer-driven marketing strategies that build the right relationships with the right customers. Thus, most companies have moved away from mass marketing and toward *target marketing*: identifying market segments, selecting one or more of them, and developing products and marketing programs tailored to each.

# Marketing Strategy

**Figure 7.1** shows the four major steps in designing a customer value–driven marketing strategy. In the first two steps, the company selects the customers that it will serve. **Market segmentation** involves dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers who have different needs, characteristics, or behaviors and who might require separate marketing strategies or mixes. The company identifies different ways to segment the market and develops profiles of the resulting market segments. **Market targeting (or targeting)** consists of evaluating each market segment’s attractiveness and selecting one or more market segments to enter.

In the final two steps, the company decides on a value proposition—how it will create value for target customers. **Differentiation** involves actually differentiating the

### Figure 7.1 Designing a Customer-Driven Marketing Strategy

This table outlines a strategic marketing framework for creating value for targeted customers. The process begins with "Select customers to serve," which involves two key steps: "Segmentation," dividing the total market into smaller, distinct groups, and "Targeting," choosing which of these segments to enter. Concurrently, the framework addresses how to "Decide on a value proposition." This is achieved through "Differentiation," modifying the market offering to deliver superior customer value compared to competitors, and "Positioning," establishing a clear and desirable place for the offering in the minds of the selected target customers. The central theme emphasizes creating value specifically for these identified and targeted customer groups.

> In concept, marketing boils down to two questions:  
> (1) Which customers will we serve? and (2) How will we serve them? Of course, the tough part is coming up with good answers to these simple-sounding yet difficult questions. The goal is to create more value for the customers we serve than competitors do.
