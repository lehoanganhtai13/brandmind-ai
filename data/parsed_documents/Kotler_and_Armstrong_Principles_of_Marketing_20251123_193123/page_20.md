In between, frequent discussions and examples show how sustainable marketing calls for socially and environmentally responsible actions that meet both the immediate and the future needs of customers, companies, and society as a whole.  
* The seventeenth edition provides new discussions and examples of the growth in *global marketing*. As the world becomes a smaller, more competitive place, marketers face new global marketing challenges and opportunities, especially in fast-growing emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil, Africa, and others. You’ll find much new coverage of global marketing throughout the text, starting in Chapter 1 and discussed fully in Chapter 19.

### Five Major Customer Value and Engagement Themes

The seventeenth edition of *Principles of Marketing* builds on five major customer value and engagement themes:

1. **Creating value for customers in order to capture value from customers in return.**  
   Today’s marketers must be good at *creating customer value, engaging customers,* and *managing customer relationships*. Outstanding marketing companies understand the marketplace and customer needs, design value-creating marketing strategies, develop integrated marketing programs that engage customers and deliver value and satisfaction, and build strong customer relationships and brand community. In return, they capture value from customers in the form of sales, profits, and customer equity.  
   This innovative *customer-value and engagement framework* is introduced at the start of Chapter 1 in a five-step marketing process model, which details how marketing *creates* customer value and *captures* value in return. The framework is carefully developed in the first two chapters and then fully integrated throughout the remainder of the text.

2. **Customer Engagement and Today’s Digital and Social Media.**  
   New digital and social media have taken today’s marketing by storm, dramatically changing how companies and brands engage consumers and how consumers connect and influence each other’s brand behaviors. The seventeenth edition introduces and thoroughly explores the contemporary concept of *customer engagement marketing* and the exciting new digital and social media technologies that help brands to engage customers more deeply and interactively. It starts with two major Chapter 1 sections: *Customer Engagement and Today’s Digital and Social Media* and *The Digital Age: Online, Mobile, and Social Media*. A refreshed Chapter 17 on *Direct, Online, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing* summarizes the latest developments in digital engagement and relationship-building tools. Everywhere in between, you’ll find revised and expanded coverage of the exploding use of digital and social tools to create customer engagement and build brand community.

3. **Building and managing strong, value-creating brands.**  
   Well-positioned brands with strong brand equity provide the basis upon which to build customer value and profitable customer relationships. Today’s marketers must position their brands powerfully and manage them well to create valued brand experiences. The seventeenth edition provides a deep focus on brands, anchored by a Chapter 8 section on *Branding Strategy: Building Strong Brands*.

4. **Measuring and managing return on marketing.**  
   Especially in uneven economic times, marketing managers must ensure that their marketing dollars are being well spent. In the past, many marketers spent freely on big, expensive marketing programs, often without thinking carefully about the financial returns on their spending. But all that has changed rapidly. “Marketing accountability”—measuring and managing marketing return on investment—has now become an important part of strategic marketing decision making. This emphasis on marketing accountability is addressed in Chapter 2, in Appendix 2 (*Marketing by the Numbers*), and throughout the seventeenth edition.

5. **Sustainable marketing around the globe.**  
   As technological developments make the world an increasingly smaller and more fragile place, marketers must be good at marketing their brands globally and in sustainable ways. New material throughout the seventeenth edition emphasizes the concepts of global marketing and sustainable marketing—meeting the present needs of consumers and businesses while also preserving or enhancing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
