# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### Sharing Economy

Changes in the technological environment have created amazing opportunities for new business models while at the same time threatening traditional ones. For example, Airbnb has shaken up the hospitality industry by allowing people to rent out spare rooms or their entire homes to strangers. The Uber and Lyft ride-sharing businesses allow consumers to find a ride from people looking to earn extra money with their vehicles. And with Uber you don’t have to worry about having enough cash or giving your credit card to the driver—payments and tips are all done through the Uber app. Traditional hotel and cab companies are crying foul, claiming that these businesses are not playing by the same regulatory rules to which they are subject. Others are concerned about safety amid reports of riders allegedly being attacked, kidnappings, and driver accidents, questioning the thoroughness of background checks of the 160,000-plus Uber drivers around the world. Some countries, states, and cities in the United States have banned Uber because of these issues.  

**3-9** Describe how Uber’s business model works and the role technology has played in its success. What are the arguments for banning these types of businesses? What are the arguments for defending them? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)  

**3-10** Describe examples of two other businesses based on the sharing economy model and create a new business idea based on this concept. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

## Marketing Ethics  
### Your Insurance Renewal Notice Could Be a Trap

Consumers in the United Kingdom seem to be at the mercy of their own insurers. Hidden within the fine print of the renewal notices is the true cost of renewing the insurance, often as much as a 100 percent increase. This is despite the fact that there have been no claims on the insurance and perhaps the value of the insured asset has fallen since last year. Unwittingly, consumers have signed up for continuous payment to authorities. In effect, this means that consumers have agreed to continue to buy the insurance year over year, regardless of an increase in price, unless they contact the insurer and cancel it.
