# 2.1 Red Bull: The Global Market Leader in Energy Drinks Skillfully Manages Its Business Portfolio

So how does a small company breaking into the beverage business compete with such global powerhouses? The best answer: It doesn’t—at least not directly. Instead, it finds a unique market niche and runs where the big dogs don’t.

That’s what Red Bull does. When Red Bull first introduced its energy drink in Austria in 1987, few imagined that it would become the 5 billion-dollar-a-year success that it is today. Red Bull found a new beverage niche that the market leaders had overlooked: energy drinks. Although Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have followed Red Bull into the energy drinks market, the company still owns 44 percent of the energy drink category it created. Despite hefty investments, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are yet to make a dent in the category. This is because Red Bull was first in the market and in defining the new category, but more importantly because of the company’s ability to engender and foster a deep customer loyalty. For example, Red Bull’s Facebook Fan Page has more than 44 million likes, whereas Coca-Cola’s Facebook page for its NOS energy drink only registers 380,000 likes and Pepsi’s Facebook page for Amp only accounts for 48,000 likes, while the Kickstart brand barely even triggers 1,000 likes. Red Bull has energized a market niche with a unique product, brand personality, and marketing approach.

Back in 1987, energy drinks simply didn’t exist. Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz saw an unfilled customer need. He formulated a new beverage containing a hefty dose of caffeine that packed the right punch, producing unique physical-energy and mental-clarity benefits. To make the new beverage even more distinctive, Mateschitz gave it a unique name: Red Bull. He packaged it in a slim 8.3-ounce (250 ml) blue-and-silver can with a distinct red-and-yellow logo, and tagged it with a $2-per-can price. Thus, a whole new energy drink category was born, with Red Bull as its only player.

The unique Red Bull product demanded equally unique brand positioning and personality, a declaration that this was no ordinary beverage. The brand’s first and still only slogan—“Red Bull Gives You Wings”—communicated the product’s energy-inducing benefits. More important, it tapped into the forces that moved the brand’s narrow target niche: customers seeking to live in the adrenalin-stoked fast lane.

Red Bull shunned the big-budget mass-media advertising common in the beverage industry at the time. Instead, it relied on grassroots, high-octane sports and event marketing. It sponsored extreme sports events and athletes who were overlooked by big beverage competitors but were spiking in popularity with Red Bull’s target customers. In the years since, Red Bull has turned event marketing into a science. Today, the brand holds hundreds of events each year in dozens of sports around the world. Each event features off-the-grid experiences designed to bring the high-octane world of Red Bull to its narrow but impassioned community of enthusiasts. But it’s not just about the events; it’s about creating tactile engagements where people can feel, touch, taste, and live the brand face-to-face rather than simply reading about or watching it. Red Bull doesn’t just sponsor an event—it *is* the event.

One example of Red Bull’s niche marketing genius is the Red Bull Stratos project, which set records for consumer brand engagement. Felix Baumgartner’s dive from space fit perfectly with Red Bull’s brand message. More than 8 million people watched the event live on 40 TV stations and 130 digital channels.

Red Bull’s niche marketing engages customers in a way that big-budget traditional marketing by competitors like Coca-Cola or Pepsi can’t. For example, within 40 minutes of posting photos of Baumgartner’s jump, Red Bull’s Facebook page gained almost 216,000 likes, 10,000 comments, and over 29,000 shares. On Twitter, half of the worldwide trending topics were related to Red Bull Stratos. By one estimate, 90 million people worldwide followed the campaign on social media, creating 60 million trusted brand impressions.

Since its introduction, Red Bull has invested deeply in building the brand, spending around 40 percent of revenue on marketing and promotion. As a comparison, Coca-Cola spends 9 percent. As to its product portfolio, the company had one product to focus on until 2003, when a sugar-free version was added. On March 24, 2008, Red Bull introduced “Simply Cola,” or “Red Bull Cola.” In the summer of 2009, the Red Bull Energy Shots were introduced globally. This is a small version of the regular drink.
