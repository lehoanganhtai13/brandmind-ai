According to Fabletics company website, www.fabletics.com,  
“JustFab Inc. co-CEOs, Don Ressler and Adam Goldenberg, launched Fabletics with Kate Hudson after they saw a gap in the activewear marketplace. There were plenty of luxury brands, but none that offered stylish and high-quality gear at an accessible price point. These three unstoppable innovators joined forces to create the Fabletics brand in 2013.” Fabletics, a division of JustFab, offers affordable, high-quality, and stylish workout clothes including yoga pants, leggings, joggers, tops, tees, and more for women and men at every fitness level. After being in business just a few short years, the company ranked number 98 in the Internet Retailer 2015 Top 500 Guide with revenues of $150 million. Although initially internet-based, Fabletics moved into brick-and-mortar retailing in 2015. It plans to open 75 to 100 stores by 2020. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking; Use of IT)
