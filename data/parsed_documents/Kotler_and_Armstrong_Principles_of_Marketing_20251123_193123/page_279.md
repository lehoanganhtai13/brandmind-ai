# 9 Developing New Products  
## and Managing the Product Life Cycle

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

In the previous chapter, you learned how marketers manage and develop products and brands. In this chapter, we examine two additional product topics: developing new products and managing products through their life cycles. New products are the lifeblood of an organization. However, new product development is risky, and many new products fail. So, the first part of this chapter lays out a process for finding and growing successful new products. Once introduced, marketers then want their products to enjoy long and happy lives. In the second part of this chapter, you’ll see that every product passes through several life-cycle stages, and each stage poses new challenges requiring different marketing strategies and tactics. Finally, we wrap up our product discussion by looking at two additional considerations: social responsibility in product decisions and international product and services marketing.

For openers, consider Samsung, the world’s leading consumer electronics maker and one of the world’s most innovative companies. Over the past two decades, Samsung has transformed itself by creating a culture of customer-focused innovation and a seemingly endless flow of inspired new products that feature stunning design, innovative technology, life-enriching features, and a big dose of “Wow!”

## SAMSUNG: Enriching Customers’ Lives through New-Product Innovation

You’re probably familiar with the Samsung brand. Maybe you own one of Samsung’s hot new Galaxy smartphones that tracks your eye movements to help you navigate the screen, or maybe you’ve seen one of Samsung’s dazzling new Superior 4k Ultra-High-Definition Smart TVs with a fully immersive curved screen and nano-crystal technology. Samsung, the world’s largest consumer electronics manufacturer, produces “gotta-have” electronics in just about every category, from TVs and Blu-ray players, tablets and mobile phones, and smartwatches to smart-home devices and even a full range of home appliances.

But little more than 20 years ago, Samsung was barely known, and it was anything but cutting-edge. Back then, Samsung was a Korean copycat brand that you bought off a shipping pallet at Costco if you couldn’t afford a Sony, then the world’s most coveted consumer electronics brand. However, in 1993 Samsung made an inspired decision. It turned its back on cheap knockoffs and set out to overtake rival Sony. To dethrone the consumer electronics giant, however, Samsung first had to change its entire culture, from copycat to leading-edge. To outsell Sony, Samsung decided, it first had to out-innovate Sony.

Samsung’s dramatic shift began with a top-down mandate for reform. Samsung set out to become a premier brand and a trailblazing product leader. It hired a crop of fresh, young designers and managers who unleashed a torrent of new products—not humdrum, me-too products, but sleek, bold, and beautiful products targeted to high-end users. Samsung called them “lifestyle works of art.” Every new product had to pass the “Wow!” test: If it didn’t get a “Wow!” reaction during market testing, it went straight back to the design studio. Beyond cutting-edge technology and stylish designs, Samsung put the customer at the core of its innovation movement. Its primary innovation goal was to improve the customer experience and bring genuine change to people’s lives in everything it did.

With its fresh customer-centered new-product focus, Samsung overtook Sony in less than 10 years. Today, Samsung’s annual revenues of $196 billion are more than two and a half times Sony’s revenues, placing it at number 13 on *Fortune*’s Global 500—two spots
