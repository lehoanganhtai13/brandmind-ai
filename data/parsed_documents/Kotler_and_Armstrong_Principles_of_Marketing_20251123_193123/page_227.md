# Individual Marketing

Individual Marketing. In the extreme, micromarketing becomes **individual marketing**—tailoring products and marketing programs to the needs and preferences of individual customers. Individual marketing has also been labeled one-to-one marketing, mass customization, and markets-of-one marketing.

The widespread use of mass marketing has obscured the fact that for centuries consumers were served as individuals: The tailor custom-made a suit, the cobbler designed shoes for an individual, and the cabinetmaker made furniture to order. Today, new technologies are permitting many companies to return to customized marketing. Detailed databases, robotic production and flexible manufacturing, and interactive technologies such as smartphones and online and social media have combined to foster mass customization. *Mass customization* is the process by which firms interact one to one with masses of customers to design products, services, and marketing programs tailor-made to individual needs.

Companies these days are hyper-customizing everything from food, artwork, earphones, and sneakers to high-end luxury products. At one end of the spectrum, candy lovers can go to mymms.com and buy M&Ms with personalized messages or pictures embossed on each little candy. Visit Nike ID or Puma Factory online to design and order your very own personalized sneakers. JH Audio in Orlando makes customized earphones based on molds of customers’ ears to provide optimized fit and better and safer sound. The company even laser-prints designs on the tiny ear buds—some people request a kid for each ear; others prefer a dog.

At the other extreme are “bespoke” luxury goods (a fancy word for “custom-made” or “made to order”). For the right price, well-heeled customers can buy custom-designed goods ranging from bespoke fashions and accessories by Hermes and Gucci to bespoke cars from Aston Martin or Rolls-Royce.

Ninety-five percent of Rolls-Royce buyers customize their cars in some way. Customers can sit down with a Rolls-Royce Bespoke design team—color experts, leather-smiths, master woodworkers—in a lounge filled with images, materials, and other inspirational elements to design their own unique Rolls-Royces. Want to match the exterior paint and interior leather to your favorite pale pink leather gloves? No problem. Want to customize your door handles, have your initials and a meaningful logo stitched into the headrests, or install mother-of-pearl inlays, crocodile skin seating, rabbit-pelt linings, or mahogany trim? Easily done. One customer even wanted his car’s interior trim to be made from a favorite tree that had recently fallen on his estate. After analyzing a sample, a Rolls-Royce craftsman deemed the wood acceptable and the customer’s tree will now live forever in the dash and door panels of his custom Rolls-Royce. “Outside of compromising the safety of the car—or disfiguring the Spirit of Ecstasy—we won’t say no,” says a Rolls-Royce executive.

Beyond customizing products, marketers also customize their marketing messages to engage customers on a one-to-one basis. For example, Nike collected data on its most enthusiastic customers, those who train using FuelBands and apps such as Nike+ Running. It then used the data to create 100,000 customized animated videos based on each individual’s actual workout activities. For example, one video might feature an animation of a person in Los Angeles running past the Hollywood sign; another might show a New Yorker running in the rain along the East River. Nike then emailed the unique customized videos to each of the 100,000 Nike+ users, challenging them to achieve new heights in the coming year. The videos not only engaged Nike’s biggest fans, they also spread to the broader Nike community. “These are some of the most social people on the planet,” says one campaign manager. “They share like crazy. So that becomes a pretty awesome flagship marketing move for Nike.” Companies need to consider many factors when choosing a market-targeting strategy.
