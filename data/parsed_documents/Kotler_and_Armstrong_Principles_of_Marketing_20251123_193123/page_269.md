more private brands, which on average yield a 25 percent savings. More frugal times give store brands a boost as consumers become more price-conscious and less brand-conscious.

In fact, store brands have grown much faster than national brands in recent years. In a recent survey, 65 percent of consumers indicated that they buy store brands whenever they are available in a supermarket. Similarly, for apparel sales, department store private-label brands have shot up. At Kohl’s, for example, private-label sales account for more than half of its annual revenue.

Many large retailers skillfully market a deep assortment of store-brand merchandise.  
For example, Kroger’s private brands—the Kroger house brand, Private Selection, Heritage Farm, Simple Truth (natural and organic), Psst and Check This Out (savings), and others—add up to a whopping 25 percent of the giant grocery retailer’s sales, nearly $25 billion worth annually. At thrifty grocery chain ALDI, more than 90 percent of sales come from private brands such as Baker’s Choice, Friendly Farms, Simply Nature, and Mama Cozzi’s Pizza Kitchen. Even online retailer Amazon has developed a stable of private brands, including AmazonBasics (electronics), Pinzon (kitchen gadgets), Strathwood (outdoor furniture), Pike Street (bath and home products), and Denali (tools).

Once known as “generic” or “no-name” brands, today’s store brands have shed their image as cheap knockoffs of national brands. Store brands now offer much greater selection, and they are rapidly achieving name-brand quality. In fact, retailers such as Target and Trader Joe’s are out-innovating many of their national-brand competitors. Kroger even offers a Kroger brand guarantee—“Try it, like it, or get the national brand free.” As a result, consumers are becoming loyal to store brands for reasons besides price. In some cases, consumers are even willing to pay more for store brands that have been positioned as gourmet or premium items.

In the so-called *battle of the brands* between national and private brands, retailers have many advantages. They control what products they stock, where they go on the shelf, what prices they charge, and which ones they will feature in local promotions. Retailers often price their store brands lower than comparable national brands and feature the price differences in side-by-side comparisons on store shelves. Although store brands can be hard to establish and costly to stock and promote, they also yield higher profit margins for the reseller. And they give resellers exclusive products that cannot be bought from competitors, resulting in greater store traffic and loyalty. Retailer Trader Joe’s, which carries approximately 90 percent store brands, largely controls its own brand destiny rather than relying on producers to make and manage the brands it needs to serve its customers best.

To compete with store brands, national brands must sharpen their value propositions, especially when appealing to today’s more frugal consumers. Many national brands are fighting back by rolling out more discounts and coupons to defend their market share. In the long run, however, leading brand marketers must compete by investing in new brands, new features, and quality improvements that set them apart. They must design strong advertising programs to maintain high awareness and preference. And they must find ways to partner with major distributors to find distribution economies and improve joint performance.

For example, in response to the surge in private-label sales, consumer product giant Procter & Gamble has redoubled its efforts to develop and promote new and better products, particularly at lower price points. “We invest $2 billion a year in research and development, $400 million on consumer knowledge, and about 10 percent of sales on advertising,” says P&G’s CEO. “Store brands don’t have that capacity.” As a result, P&G brands still dominate in their categories. For example, its Tide, Gain, Cheer, and other premium laundry detergent brands capture a combined 60 percent of the $7 billion U.S. detergent market.

**Licensing.** Most manufacturers take years and spend millions to create their own brand names. However, some companies license names or symbols previously created by other manufacturers, names of well-known celebrities, or characters from popular movies and books. For a fee, any of these can provide an instant and proven brand name. For example, consider the Kodak brand with its familiar red and yellow colors, which has retained its value even after the company went bankrupt and discontinued its consumer products.
