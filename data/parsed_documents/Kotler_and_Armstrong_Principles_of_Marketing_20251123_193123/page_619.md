Table 20.1 presents a series of eight morally difficult situations encountered in marketing, structured as a comparative dilemma. Each situation poses a choice between potentially unethical or questionable actions and more principled, albeit possibly less profitable, alternatives. The scenarios cover product claims and improvements, product line strategies, hiring practices involving competitor information, dealer management, international business dealings with bribery implications, competitive intelligence gathering, advertising campaign selection based on effectiveness versus ethical appeal, and gender-based hiring decisions impacting sales. The overarching theme is the conflict between maximizing sales and profit versus adhering to ethical marketing principles and fair business practices.

Under the societal marketing concept, each manager must look beyond what is legal and allowed and develop standards based on personal integrity, corporate conscience, and long-run consumer welfare.

Dealing with issues of ethics and social responsibility in a proactive, open, and forthright way helps to build and maintain strong customer relationships based on honesty and trust. For example, think about SC Johnson, maker of familiar home-products brands such as Pledge, Shout, Windex, Ziploc, and Saran Wrap. SC Johnson believes deeply that “Integrity is part of our DNA. It’s been our family way since 1886.” Based on that belief, the company has a long tradition of doing what’s right, even at the expense of sales. Just one example involves Saran Wrap, a longtime market leader and one of SC Johnson’s best-known and biggest brands:  

> For more than 50 years, Saran Wrap was made with polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), an ingredient responsible for the product’s two major differentiating features: impenetrable odor barrier qualities and superior microwavability. Without PVDC, Saran Wrap would have been no better than competing wraps by Glad and Reynolds, which did not contain PVDC. In the early 2000s, however, regulators, environmentalists, and consumers began to voice concerns about materials containing chlorine, specifically polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In fact, SC Johnson’s own Greenlist analysis—by which it rates product ingredients based on their impact on environmental and human health—confirmed the hazards of PVCs, and the company quickly pledged to eliminate them from its products and packaging.  
>  
> But SC Johnson took things a step further. In 2004, it also eliminated PVDCs, even though that important ingredient had not yet come under scrutiny. The company developed a PVDC-free polyethylene version of Saran Wrap, an admittedly less effective product. Sure enough, Saran Wrap’s market share dropped from 18 percent in 2004 to only 11 percent today. Over the years, however, even though such decisions have sometimes hurt sales, they have helped SC Johnson to earn and keep the trust of customers.
