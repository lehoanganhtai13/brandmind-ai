# 4.2 Netflix Streams Success with Big Data and Marketing Analytics

Americans now watch more movies and TV programs streamed online than they watch on DVDs and Blu-ray discs. And with its rotating library of more than 60,000 titles, Netflix streams more movie and program content by far than any other video service. Netflix’s 81.5 million paid subscribers watch some 3.8 billion hours of movies and TV programs every month. A remarkable 51 percent of all Americans have streamed Netflix content during the past year.

All of this comes as little surprise to avid Netflixers. But members might be startled to learn that while they are busy watching Netflix videos, Netflix is busy watching *them*—watching them very, very closely. Netflix tracks and analyzes heaps of customer data in excruciating detail. Then it uses the big data insights to give customers exactly what they want. Netflix knows in depth what its audience wants to watch, and it uses this knowledge to fuel recommendations to subscribers, decide what programming to offer, and even develop its own exclusive content.

No company knows its customers better than Netflix. The company has mind-boggling access to real-time data on member viewing behavior and sentiments. Every day, Netflix tracks and parses member data on tens of millions of searches, ratings, and “plays.” Netflix’s bulging database contains every viewing detail for each individual subscriber—what shows they watch, at what time of day, on what devices, at what locations, even when they hit the pause, rewind, or fast-forward buttons during programs.

Netflix supplements this already-massive database with consumer information purchased from Nielsen, Facebook, Twitter, and other sources. Finally, the company employs experts to classify each video on hundreds of characteristics, such as talent, action, tone, genre, color, volume, scenery, and many, many others. Using this rich base of big data, Netflix builds detailed subscriber profiles based on individual viewing habits and preferences. It then uses these profiles to personalize each customer’s viewing experience. According to Netflix, there are 69 million different versions of Netflix, one for each individual subscriber worldwide.

For example, Netflix uses data on viewing history to make personalized recommendations.

Wading through 60,000 titles to decide what to watch can be overwhelming. So when new customers sign up, Netflix asks them to rate their interest in movie and TV genres and to rate specific titles they have already seen. It then cross-references what people like with other similar titles to predict additional movies or programs customers will enjoy.

But that’s just the beginning. As customers watch and rate more and more video content, and as Netflix studies the details of their viewing behavior, the predictions become more and more accurate. Netflix often comes to know individual customer viewing preferences better than customers themselves do. How accurate are Netflix’s recommendations? Seventy-five percent of viewing activity results from these suggestions. That’s important. The more subscribers watch, the more likely they are to stay with Netflix—viewers who watch at least 15 hours of content each month are 75 percent less likely to cancel. Accurate recommendations increase average viewing time, keeping subscribers in the fold.

Increased viewing also depends on offering the right content in the first place. But adding new programming is expensive—content licensing fees constitute the lion’s share of Netflix’s cost of goods sold. With so many new and existing movies and TV programs on the market, Netflix must be very selective in what it adds to its content inventory. Once again, it’s big data and marketing analytics to the rescue. Just as Netflix analyzes its database to come up with subscriber recommendations, it uses the data to assess what additional titles customers might enjoy and how much each is worth. The goal is to maximize subscriber “happiness-per-dollar-spent” on new titles. “We always use our in-depth knowledge about what our members love to watch to decide what’s available on Netflix,” says a Netflix marketer. “If you keep watching, we’ll keep adding more of what you love.”

To get even more viewers watching even more hours, Netflix uses its extensive big data insights to add its own exclusive video content—things you can see only on Netflix. In its own words, Netflix wants “to become HBO faster than HBO can become Netflix.” For example, Netflix stunned the media industry when it outbid both HBO and AMC by paying a stunning $100 million for exclusive rights to air the first two seasons of *House of Cards*, a U.S. version of a hit British political drama produced by Hollywood bigwigs David Fincher and Kevin Spacey.
