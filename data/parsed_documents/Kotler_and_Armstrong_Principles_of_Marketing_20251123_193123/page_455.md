Such advertising wants to engage customers and create brand community.

Some persuasive advertising has become *comparative advertising* (or *attack advertising*), in which a company directly or indirectly compares its brand with one or more other brands. You see examples of comparative advertising in almost every product category, ranging from soft drinks and fast food to car rentals, credit cards, and wireless phone services. For example, Pepsi has long fielded comparative ads that take direct aim at rival Coca-Cola:⁴

Comparative advertising: Pepsi has long taken direct aim at rival Coca-Cola with comparative ads. “There are few things that grab our fans’ attention as much as seeing our beloved blue and that red next to each other,” says a Pepsi marketer. PepsiCo

It began years ago with the long-running “Pepsi Challenge” campaign, where Pepsi ads showed blind taste tests in shopping malls and other public places in which consumers invariably preferred the taste of Pepsi to that of Coca-Cola. 🔵 Since then, Pepsi has run regular comparative ads tweaking its larger competitor, ranging from an ad showing Santa Claus (long associated with Coca-Cola advertising) choosing a Pepsi over a Coke to one in which a Pepsi delivery driver snaps a candid photo of a Coke driver covertly draining a cold can of Pepsi. In another ad, a happy Pepsi drinker mocks a Coke buyer by telling him, “You’ve still got the polar bear” (another Coca-Cola ad symbol). A scraggly polar bear then sadly pets the Coke drinker. Such comparison ads have been popular with Pepsi fans. “There are few things that grab our fans’ attention as much as seeing our beloved blue and that red next to each other,” says Pepsi’s brand marketing and digital director. “It’s done well for us in the past, and it’s just something that we know works and that they love to see.”

Comparative advertising campaigns often create controversy. Many times, that’s the point of using them. Whereas established market leaders want to exclude other brands from the consumer’s choice set, challengers want to shake things up, inject their brands into the consumer conversation, and put themselves on equal footing with the leader. Comparative advertising in the smartphone segment has been used by Apple and Samsung against each other. However, in 2016 Lenovo launched an aggressive comparative advertising campaign attacking the two giants (see Real Marketing 15.1).

Still, advertisers should use comparative advertising with caution. All too often, such ads invite competitor responses, resulting in an advertising war that neither competitor can win. Upset competitors might also take more drastic action, such as filing complaints with the self-regulatory National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus or even filing false-advertising lawsuits. Consider the reactions of competitors to recent comparative ads by Chobani:

> One Chobani Simply 100 yogurt ad shows a woman scrutinizing the label on a container of Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt and promptly discarding it as the ad voiceover says, “Potassium sorbate? Really? That stuff is used to kill bugs.” The ad concludes by noting that Chobani Simply 100 Greek yogurt contains zero preservatives. Another ad portrays a woman sitting poolside tossing a container of Dannon Light and Fit into the trash as a voiceover declares, “Sucralose, why? That stuff has chlorine added to it. Chobani Simply 100 is the only 100-calorie yogurt sweetened naturally.” Competitors didn’t take kindly to the jabs. Yoplait maker General Mills filed a lawsuit against Chobani for misleading advertising. And Dannon’s lawyers sent Chobani a cease-and-desist letter asking it to discontinue the campaign. In turn, Chobani sued Dannon asking the courts to confirm that Chobani’s advertising is not misleading. Only time will tell how it all turns out. But the skirmishes aren’t likely to benefit any of the competitors.⁵

*Reminder advertising* is important for mature products; it helps to maintain customer relationships and keep consumers thinking about the product. For example, a recent ad campaign for Silk soymilk tells consumers to “Fall back in love with Soymilk,” reminding them of the many reasons that “Silk helps you bloom.” Expensive Coca-Cola television ads primarily build and maintain the Coca-Cola brand relationship rather than inform consumers or persuade them to buy it in the short run.
