discover beauty products, post photo and links, and ask other members to weigh in with information and advice (“all the things marketers dreamed would happen on Facebook, but didn’t,” notes one observer). ● And you can’t buy anything at ESPN.com. Instead, the site creates a vast branded sports community:9

At ESPN.com, sports fans can access an almost overwhelming repository of sports information, statistics, and game updates. They can customize site content by sport, team, players, and authors to match their own special sports interests and team preferences. The site engages fans in contests and fantasy games (everything from fantasy football, baseball, basketball, and hockey to poker). Sports fans from around the world can participate in discussions with other fans and celebrities before, during, and after sporting events. They can friend and message other users and post comments on message boards and blogs. By downloading various widgets and apps, fans can customize their ESPN experience and carry it with them wherever they go. In all, ESPN’s website creates a virtual brand community without walls, a must-have experience that keeps fans coming back again and again.

Creating a website is one thing; getting people to *visit* the site is another. To attract visitors, companies aggressively promote their websites in offline print and broadcast advertising and through ads and links on other sites. But today’s web users are quick to abandon any website that doesn’t measure up. The key is to create enough engaging and valued content to get consumers to come to the site, stick around, and come back again.

At the very least, a website should be easy to use and visually appealing. Ultimately, however, websites must also be *useful*. When it comes to online browsing and shopping, most people prefer substance over style and function over flash. For example, ESPN’s site isn’t all that flashy, and it’s pretty heavily packed and congested. But it connects customers quickly and effectively to all the sports information and involvement they are seeking. Thus, effective websites contain deep and useful information, interactive tools that help find and evaluate content of interest, links to other related sites, changing promotional offers, and entertaining features that lend relevant excitement.

Online Advertising  
As consumers spend more and more time online, companies are shifting more of their marketing dollars to **online advertising** to build brand sales or attract visitors to their internet, mobile, and social media sites. Online advertising has become a major promotional medium. The main forms of online advertising are display ads and search-related ads. Together, display and search-related ads account for the largest portion of firms’ digital marketing budgets.

*Online display ads* might appear anywhere on an internet user’s screen and are often related to the information being viewed. Such display ads have come a long way in recent years in terms of engaging consumers and moving them along the path to purchase. Today’s *rich media* ads incorporate animation, video, sound, and interactivity. ● For example, while browsing sports-related content on your laptop, tablet, or phone, you might see a bright blue and green banner ad for Gillette Fusion PROGLIDE razors floating at the bottom of the page, with the provocative headline “Our Gentlest Shave.” A click on the banner expands it into a full interactive display ad, complete with an embedded 15-second demonstration video plus click-throughs to the Gillette Fusion PROGLIDE microsite and a buy-now link.
