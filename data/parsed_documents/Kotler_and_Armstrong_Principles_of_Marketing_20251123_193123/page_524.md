Snapchat users can share Discover news stories and video with personalized comments or emoji. Advertisers pay a minimum of $50,000 a day to advertise alongside the Discover content, and Snapchat has hinted that it will soon offer brand-owned Discover stories.

Snapchat also offers advertisers a sponsored feeds platform called “Live Story.” These feeds are TV-like streams of an event such as New Year’s Eve, March Madness, an important football game, or the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade, featuring user-generated content curated by Snapchat. Advertisers can buy sponsorship rights for a Live Story feed starting at $250,000, which includes a brand mention in the opening title as well as branded snaps interspersed throughout the feed. For example, Macy’s sponsors the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade feed, weaving its own brand content in with user content. Advertisers can also pay for a single 10-second brand snap woven into a feed. Live Stories feeds garner an estimated 20 million daily views within the Snapchat community.

In addition to the Discover and Live Story platforms, Snapchat continues to tinker with other advertising products and rates to find the best monetization formula. Although it now generates only a trickle of ad revenue compared with Facebook—a meager $50 million last year—the brash young social network projects that ad revenues will be six to seven times that amount this year.

In its quest to monetize, Snapchat has a lot at stake. Will increased advertising and brand content alienate avid Snapchat fans? If done right, probably not. Studies show that social media users readily accept—even welcome—well-targeted brand content. A recent Snapchat survey found that 60 percent of Snapchat users actually like its Live Story ads.

But that’s the catch—doing it right. Like its own disappearing photo feature, Snapchat’s soaring popularity could vanish quickly if overly aggressive monetization causes resentment within its highly mobile and typically fickle fan base. Snapchat must move forward carefully. As one Snapchat marketer concludes, “We’re always fine tuning to ensure we deliver the best possible experience for our community.”

## Social Media Marketing Advantages and Challenges

Using social media presents both advantages and challenges. On the plus side, social media are *targeted* and *personal*—they allow marketers to create and share tailored brand content with individual consumers and customer communities. Social media are *interactive*, making them ideal for starting and participating in customer conversations and listening to customer feedback. For example, TOMS shoes—which gives a free pair of shoes to a child in need for every shoe purchased, one for one—recently ran a two-week #withoutshoes campaign in which it donated one pair of shoes for every person who snapped a picture of their bare feet, shared it on Instagram, and urged others to do the same. The campaign resulted in more than 296,000 pairs of shoes donated, engaging customers in spreading the brand’s philanthropic message to millions around the world.26

Social media are also *immediate* and *timely*. They can be used to reach customers anytime, anywhere with timely and relevant marketing content regarding brand happenings and activities. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the rapid growth in social media usage has caused a surge in *real-time marketing*, allowing marketers to create and join consumer conversations around situations and events as they occur. Marketers can now watch what’s trending and create content to match.

Social media can be very *cost-effective*. Although creating and administering social media content can be costly, many social media are free or inexpensive to use. Thus, returns on social media investments are often high compared with those of expensive traditional media such as television or print. The low cost of social media puts them within easy reach of even small businesses and brands that can’t afford the high costs of big-budget marketing campaigns.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of social media is their *engagement* and *social sharing capabilities*. Social media are especially well suited to creating customer engagement and community—for getting customers involved with the brand and with each other. More than any other channels, social media can involve customers in shaping and sharing brand content, experiences, information, and ideas.

For example, consider Etsy—the online craft marketplace that’s “Your place to buy and sell all things handmade.” ● Etsy uses its web and mobile sites and a host of social media to create an Etsy lifestyle community, where buyers congregate to learn about, explore, exchange, Through its extensive online and social media presence, Etsy has created an active and engaged brand community of buyers and sellers in a “marketplace we make together.”
