# 10.2 Whole Foods Market: Finding the Right Price-Value Equation

Under its “Whole Foods. Whole People. Whole Planet.” mission, the chain served up a tantalizing assortment of natural, organic, and gourmet foods at premium prices, all swaddled in Earth Day politics. Its upscale, health-conscious customers were willing and able to pay higher prices for the extra value they got. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s the chain’s sales and profits soared.

Then came the Great Recession of 2008. People in all walks of life began rethinking the price-value equation and looking for ways to save. They asked tough questions, such as the following: “I love the wonderful foods and smells in my Whole Foods Market, but is it worth the extra 30 percent versus shopping at Walmart?” Even relatively affluent customers were cutting back and spending less. All of a sudden, Whole Foods Market’s seemingly perfect premium marketing strategy looked less like a plum and more like a bruised organic banana. Some customers even amended the company’s motto, making it “Whole Foods. Whole Paycheck.” For the first time in its history, the company faced declines in same-store sales, and its stock price plunged.

At the same time that its well-heeled customers were cutting back their grocery budgets, Whole Foods Market’s early success drew swarms of new, lower-priced competitors—from specialty supermarkets such as Trader Joe’s, Sprouts Farmers Market, and ALDI to traditional chains such as Kroger, Walmart, Target, and Costco—that rushed to add organics to their shelves. As Whole Foods Market’s CEO noted, “Everyone’s jumping on the natural and organic brand wagon and frankly, a lot of that’s due to our success.” Thus, even as the economy improved, many shoppers continued to spend more of their grocery budgets at lower-priced stores.

Hit hard with these new market realities, Whole Foods Market faced difficult questions. Should it hold the line on the premium positioning that had earned it so much success in the past? Or should it cut prices and reposition itself to fit the leaner, more competitive times? Faced with these alternatives, Whole Foods Market decided to stick with its core upmarket positioning strategy. But it would also subtly realign its value proposition to better meet the needs of more thrift-minded customers. It set out to downplay the gourmet element of its positioning while playing up the real value of the healthy but exciting food it offers.

First, rather than dropping its everyday prices across the board, Whole Foods lowered prices on many basic items that customers demand most and bolstered these savings by offering significant sales on selected other items. It also started emphasizing its private-label brand, 365 Everyday Value. Next, Whole Foods launched a new marketing program aimed at tempering the chain’s high-price reputation and convincing customers that Whole Foods Market was, in fact, an affordable place to shop. To help consumers see the value, it beefed up its communications about private-label and sale items using newsletters, coupons, its website, and social media. It assigned workers to serve as “value tour guides” to escort shoppers around stores and point out value items.

New ads featured headlines such as “No wallets were harmed in the buying of our 365 Everyday Value products” and “Sticker shock, but in a good way.”

However, in addition to reducing certain prices and subtly increasing its emphasis on affordable options, Whole Foods Market also moved to convince shoppers that its regular products and prices offer good value as well—that when it comes to quality food, price isn’t everything. As one tour guide noted, wherever you go, you’ll have to pay a premium for organic food. “Value means getting a good exchange for your money.” Such conversations helped to shift customers’ eyes off of price and back to value.

Whole Foods Market’s efforts to shed its “Whole Foods. Whole Paycheck.” image have been reasonably successful. Since the down days following the 2008 recession, the chain’s sales have almost doubled and profits have increased fivefold. But facing continued price pressures from resourceful competitors, Whole Foods Market has recently seen its growth begin to flag once

Whole Foods Market’s “Values Matter” campaign suggests there is more to value than bargain prices. “Value” is inseparable from “values.” NetPhotos/Alamy Stock Photo again.
