# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines three key learning objectives related to pricing strategies. Objective 10-1 focuses on defining "price" and its significance in dynamic markets. Objective 10-2 delves into the three primary pricing strategies, emphasizing the critical interplay of customer-perceived value, company costs, and competitor actions. Finally, Objective 10-3 addresses the broader context of pricing decisions by identifying and defining other internal and external factors that influence a firm's pricing choices. The structure is hierarchical, moving from a foundational definition to strategic approaches and then to contextual influences.

It will require delivering low prices *plus* selection, convenience, and a world-class online buying experience—something that Amazon perfected long ago. For Walmart, catching and conquering Amazon online will require time, resources, and skills far beyond its trademark everyday low prices. As Walmart’s president of global e-commerce puts it, the important task of winning online “will take the rest of our careers and as much as we’ve got [to invest]. This isn’t a project. It’s about the future of the company.”¹

## COMPANIES TODAY FACE A

fierce and fast-changing pricing environment. Value-seeking customers have put increased pricing pressure on many companies. Thanks to tight economic times in recent years, the pricing power of the internet, and value-driven retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, today’s consumers are pursuing more frugal spending strategies. In response, it seems that almost every company has been looking for ways to cut prices.

* Yet cutting prices is often not the best answer. Reducing prices unnecessarily can lead to lost profits and damaging price wars. It can cheapen a brand by signaling to customers that price is more important than the customer value a brand delivers. Instead, in both good economic times and bad, companies should sell value, not price. In some cases, that means selling lesser products at rock-bottom prices. But in most cases, it means persuading customers that paying a higher price for the company’s brand is justified by the greater value they gain.

### What Is a Price?

In the narrowest sense, **price** is the amount of money charged for a product or a service. More broadly, price is the sum of all the values that customers give up to gain the benefits of having or using a product or service. Historically, price has been the major factor affecting buyer choice. In recent decades, however, nonprice factors have gained increasing importance. Even so, price remains one of the most important elements that determine a firm’s market share and profitability.

Price is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; all other elements represent costs. Price is also one of the most flexible marketing mix elements. Unlike product features and channel commitments, prices can be changed quickly. At the same time, pricing is the number-one problem facing many marketing executives, and many companies do not handle pricing well. Some managers view pricing as a big headache, preferring instead to focus on other marketing mix elements.
