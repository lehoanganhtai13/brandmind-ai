This table contrasts push and pull promotion strategies, illustrating their distinct channel flows. A push strategy involves the producer engaging in marketing activities, such as personal selling and trade promotion, directed at retailers and wholesalers. These intermediaries then "push" the product to consumers through their own marketing efforts, including advertising and sales promotion. Conversely, a pull strategy focuses on the producer directly marketing to final consumers through activities like advertising and digital media. This creates consumer demand, which in turn "pulls" the product through the channel from retailers and wholesalers back to the producer. The table visually represents these differing directional flows of marketing influence and demand within the distribution channel.

Some industrial-goods companies use only push strategies; likewise, some direct marketing companies use only pull strategies. However, most large companies use some combination of both. For example, Unilever spends $8 billion worldwide each year on consumer marketing and sales promotions to create brand preference and pull customers into stores that carry its products. At the same time, it uses its own and distributors’ sales forces and trade promotions to push its brands through the channels so that they will be available on store shelves when consumers come calling.

Companies consider many factors when designing their promotion mix strategies, including the type of product and market. For example, the importance of different promotion tools varies between consumer and business markets. Business-to-consumer companies usually pull more, putting more of their funds into advertising, followed by sales promotion, personal selling, and then public relations. In contrast, business-to-business marketers tend to push more, putting more of their funds into personal selling, followed by sales promotion, advertising, and public relations.

## Integrating the Promotion Mix

Having set the promotion budget and mix, the company must now take steps to see that each promotion mix element is smoothly integrated. Guided by the company’s overall communications strategy, the various promotion elements should work together to carry the firm’s unique brand messages and selling points. Integrating the promotion mix starts with customers. Whether it’s advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, or digital and direct marketing, communications at each customer touch point must deliver consistent marketing content and positioning. An integrated promotion mix ensures that communications efforts occur when, where, and how *customers* need them.

To achieve an integrated promotion mix, all of the firm’s functions must cooperate to jointly plan communications efforts. Many companies even include customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders at various stages of communications planning. Scattered or disjointed promotional activities across the company can result in diluted marketing communications impact and confused positioning. By contrast, an integrated promotion mix maximizes the combined effects of all a firm’s promotional efforts.

## Socially Responsible Marketing Communication

In shaping its promotion mix, a company must be aware of the many legal and ethical issues surrounding marketing communications. Most marketers work hard to communicate openly and honestly with consumers and resellers. Still, abuses may occur, and public policy makers have developed a substantial body of laws and regulations to govern By law, companies must avoid false or deceptive advertising.
