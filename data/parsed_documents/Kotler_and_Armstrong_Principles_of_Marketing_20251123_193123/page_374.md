# Marketing Channels: Delivering Customer Value

*Selecting channels: Even established brands may have difficulty keeping desired channels. CVS Health’s decision to stop selling cigarettes has left tobacco companies seeking new sales channels.*

managed to get its watches into mass-merchandise outlets. This turned out to be a wise decision because of the rapid growth of mass merchandising.

Even established brands may have difficulty gaining and keeping their desired distribution, especially when dealing with powerful resellers. For example, you won’t find Marlboro, Winston, Camel, or any other cigarette brand at your local CVS pharmacy store. ● CVS Health recently announced that it will no longer sell cigarettes in its stores, despite the resulting loss of more than $2 billion in annual sales. “This is the right thing to do,” says the company. “We came to the decision that cigarettes and providing healthcare just don’t go together in the same setting.” Target dropped cigarettes nearly 20 years ago, and public advocates are pressuring Walmart to do the same. If the major discount stores and other drugstore chains such as Walgreens and Rite Aid follow suit, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and other tobacco companies will have to seek new channels for selling their brands. [17]

When selecting intermediaries, the company should determine what characteristics distinguish the better ones. It will want to evaluate each channel member’s years in business, other lines carried, location, growth and profit record, cooperativeness, and reputation.

## Managing and Motivating Channel Members

Once selected, channel members must be continuously managed and motivated to do their best. The company must sell not only *through* the intermediaries but also *to* and *with* them.

Most companies see their intermediaries as first-line customers and partners. They practice strong *partner relationship management* to forge long-term partnerships with channel members. This creates a value delivery system that meets the needs of both the company *and* its marketing partners.

In managing its channels, a company must convince suppliers and distributors that they can succeed better by working together as a part of a cohesive value delivery system. Companies must work in close harmony with others in the channel to find better ways to bring value to customers. Thus, Amazon and P&G work closely to accomplish their joint goal of selling consumer package goods profitably online. And companies ranging from automaker Toyota to cosmetics maker L’Oréal forge beneficial relationships with their large networks of suppliers to gain mutual competitive advantage (see Real Marketing 12.2).

For example, heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar works hand-in-hand with its superb dealer network—together they dominate the world’s construction, mining, and logging equipment business:

> Heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar produces innovative, high-quality industrial equipment products. But ask anyone at Caterpillar, and they’ll tell you that the most important reason for Caterpillar’s dominance is its outstanding distribution network of 189 independent dealers in more than 180 countries. Dealers are the ones on the front line. Once the product leaves the factory, the dealers take over. They’re the ones that customers see. So rather than selling to or through its dealers, Caterpillar treats dealers as inside partners. When a big piece of Caterpillar equipment breaks down, customers know that they can count on both Caterpillar and its dealer network for support. A strong dealer network makes for a strong Caterpillar, and the other way around. On a deeper level, dealers play a vital role in almost every aspect of Caterpillar’s operations, from product design and delivery to service and support. As a result of its close partnership with dealers, Caterpillar dominates the world’s markets for heavy construction, mining, and logging equipment. Its familiar yellow tractors, crawlers, loaders, bulldozers, and trucks capture a commanding share of the worldwide heavy-equipment business, nearly twice that of number-two Komatsu.

Many companies are now installing integrated high-tech partnership relationship management (PRM) systems to coordinate their whole-channel marketing efforts. Just as they use customer relationship management (CRM) software systems to help manage Today’s successful companies know that they can’t go it alone in creating value for customers.
