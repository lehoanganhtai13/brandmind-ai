# Pricing: Understanding and Capturing Customer Value

But Walmart isn’t about to let that happen without a fight. Instead, it’s taking the battle to Amazon’s home territory—the internet and mobile buying. It started with the tactics it knows best—low costs and prices. Through aggressive pricing, Walmart is now fighting for every dollar consumers spend online. If you compare prices at Walmart.com and Amazon.com, you’ll find a price war raging across a broad range of products.

In a price war, Walmart would seem to have the edge. Low costs and prices are in the company’s DNA. Through the years, Walmart has used its efficient operations and immense buying power to slash prices and thrash one competitor after another. But Amazon is not like most other competitors. Its network is optimized for online shopping, and the internet seller isn’t saddled with the costs of running physical stores. As a result, Amazon has been able to match or even beat Walmart at its own pricing game online.

The two giants now seem pretty much stalemated on low prices, giving neither much of an advantage there. In fact, in the long run, reckless price cutting will likely do more damage than good to both Walmart and Amazon. So, although low prices will be crucial, they won’t be enough to win over online buyers. Today’s online shoppers want it all, low prices *and* selection, speed, convenience, and a satisfying overall shopping experience.

For now, Amazon seems to have the upper hand on most of the important nonprice buying factors. Its made-for-online distribution network speeds orders to buyers’ homes quickly and efficiently—including same-day and Sunday delivery in some markets. Amazon’s online assortment outstrips even Walmart’s, and the online and mobile shopping wizard is now moving into groceries, an area that currently accounts for 56 percent of Walmart’s sales. As for Amazon’s lack of physical stores—no problem. Amazon’s heavily used mobile app lets customers shop Amazon.com even as they are browsing Walmart’s stores. Finally, Amazon’s unmatched, big data–driven customer interface creates personalized, highly satisfying online buying experiences. Amazon regularly rates among the leaders in customer satisfaction across all industries. According to one analyst, “consumers have said the Amazon shopping experience is *just plain better* than Walmart’s. In fact, Amazon arguably offers the best shopping experience, period.”

By contrast, Walmart came late to online selling. Although it’s now pouring billions of dollars into e-commerce technology, it’s still trying to figure out how to efficiently deliver goods into the hands of online shoppers. As its online sales have grown, the store-based giant has patched together a makeshift online distribution network out of unused corners of its store distribution centers. And the still-mostly-store retailer has yet to come close to matching Amazon’s online customer buying experience. So even with its impressive low-price legacy, Walmart finds itself playing catch-up online.

To catch up, Walmart is investing heavily to create a next-generation fulfillment network. Importantly, it’s taking advantage of a major asset that Amazon can’t match—an opportunity

to integrate online buying with its massive network of brick-and-mortar stores. For example, Walmart now fulfills more than a fifth of Walmart.com orders more quickly and cheaply by having workers in stores pluck and pack items and mail or deliver them to customers’ homes. Two-thirds of the U.S. population lives within five miles of a Walmart store, offering the potential for 30-minute delivery.

And by combining its online and offline operations, Walmart can provide some unique services, such as free and convenient pickup and returns of online orders in stores (Walmart.com gives you three buying options: “online,” “in-store,” and “site-to-store”). Using Walmart’s website and mobile app can also smooth in-store shopping. They let customers prepare shopping lists in advance, locate products by aisle to reduce wasted shopping time, and use their smartphones at checkout with preloaded digital coupons applied automatically. Customers who pick up online orders in the store can pay with cash, opening up online shopping to the 20 percent of Walmart customers who don’t have bank accounts or credit cards. For customers who do pay online, Walmart is testing in-store lockers where customers can simply go to an assigned locker for pickup.

Who will win the battle for the hearts and dollars of online buyers? Certainly, low prices will continue to be important. But Achieving online supremacy will involve much more than just waging and winning an online price war.
