The largest, fastest-growing segments are not always the most attractive ones for every company. Smaller companies may lack the skills and resources needed to serve larger segments. Or they may find these segments too competitive. Such companies may target segments that are smaller and less attractive, in an absolute sense, but that are potentially more profitable for them.

The company also needs to examine major structural factors that affect long-run segment attractiveness.¹⁴ For example, a segment is less attractive if it already contains many strong and aggressive competitors or if it is easy for *new entrants* to come into the segment. The existence of many actual or potential *substitute products* may limit prices and the profits that can be earned in a segment. The relative *power of buyers* also affects segment attractiveness. Buyers with strong bargaining power relative to sellers will try to force prices down, demand more services, and set competitors against one another—all at the expense of seller profitability. Finally, a segment may be less attractive if it contains *powerful suppliers* that can control prices or reduce the quality or quantity of ordered goods and services.

Even if a segment has the right size and growth and is structurally attractive, the company must consider its own objectives and resources. Some attractive segments can be dismissed quickly because they do not mesh with the company’s long-run objectives. Or the company may lack the skills and resources needed to succeed in an attractive segment. For example, the economy segment of the automobile market is large and growing. But given its objectives and resources, it would make little sense for luxury-performance carmaker Mercedes-Benz to enter this segment. A company should only enter segments in which it can create superior customer value and gain advantages over its competitors.

## Selecting Target Market Segments

After evaluating different segments, the company must decide which and how many segments it will target. A **target market** consists of a set of buyers who share common needs or characteristics that a company decides to serve. Market targeting can be carried out at several different levels. **Figure 7.2** shows that companies can target very broadly (*undifferentiated marketing*), very narrowly (*micromarketing*), or somewhere in between (*differentiated or concentrated marketing*).

### Definitions

**Target market**  
A set of buyers who share common needs or characteristics that a company decides to serve.

**Undifferentiated (mass) marketing**  
A market-coverage strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and go after the whole market with one offer.

**Differentiated (segmented) marketing**  
A market-coverage strategy in which a firm targets several market segments and designs separate offers for each.

### Undifferentiated Marketing

Using an **undifferentiated marketing** (or **mass marketing**) strategy, a firm might decide to ignore market segment differences and target the whole market with one offer. Such a strategy focuses on what is *common* in the needs of consumers rather than on what is *different*. The company designs a product and a marketing program that will appeal to the largest number of buyers.

As noted earlier in the chapter, most modern marketers have strong doubts about this strategy. Difficulties arise in developing a product or brand that will satisfy all consumers. Moreover, mass marketers often have trouble competing with more-focused firms that do a better job of satisfying the needs of specific segments and niches.

### Differentiated Marketing

Using a **differentiated marketing** (or **segmented marketing**) strategy, a firm decides to target several market segments and designs separate offers for each. For example, P&G

### Figure 7.2  
Market-Targeting Strategies

This figure illustrates a spectrum of marketing targeting strategies, ranging from broad to narrow approaches. At the widest end is undifferentiated (mass) marketing, which involves no specific targeting. Moving towards more focused strategies, differentiated (segmented) marketing targets several market segments. Concentrated (niche) marketing narrows the focus further to a single, specific market segment. Finally, at the narrowest end of the spectrum, micromarketing encompasses both local marketing, which tailors offerings to local customer groups, and individual marketing, which customizes products and programs for individual customers. The overarching structure is a continuum, progressing from a broad market scope to highly individualized customer approaches.
