# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

> **Social marketing firm BzzAgent takes a different approach to creating buzz. It creates customers for a client brand, then turns them into influential brand advocates:**  
> BzzAgent has assembled a volunteer army of natural-born buzzers, millions of actual shoppers around the world who are highly active in social media and who love to talk about and recommend products. Once a client signs on, BzzAgent searches its database and selects “agents” that fit the profiles of the product’s target customers. Selected volunteers receive product samples, creating a personal brand experience. BzzAgent then urges the agents to share their honest opinions of the product through face-to-face conversations and via tweets, Facebook posts,  
> online photo and video sharing, blogs, and other social sharing venues. If the product is good, the positive word of mouth spreads quickly. If the product is iffy—well, that’s worth learning quickly as well. BzzAgent advocates have successfully buzzed the brands of hundreds of top marketing companies, from P&G, Nestle, Coca-Cola, and Estee Lauder to Kroger, Disney, and Dunkin’ Donuts. BzzAgent’s appeal is its authenticity. The agents aren’t scripted. Instead, the company tells its advocates, “Here’s the product; if you believe in it, say whatever you think. Bzz is no place for excessive, repetitive, or unauthentic posts.”

## Nonpersonal Communication Channels

Media that carry messages without personal contact or feedback, including major media, atmospheres, and events.

Nonpersonal Communication Channels. Nonpersonal communication channels are media that carry messages without personal contact or feedback. They include major media, atmospheres, and events. Major *media* include print media (newspapers, magazines, direct mail), broadcast media (television, radio), display media (billboards, signs, posters), and online media (email, company websites, and brand mobile and social media sites). *Atmospheres* are designed environments that create or reinforce the buyer’s leanings toward buying a product. Thus, lawyers’ offices and banks are designed to communicate confidence and other qualities that might be valued by clients. *Events* are staged occurrences that communicate messages to target audiences. For example, public relations departments arrange grand openings, shows and exhibits, public tours, and other events.

Nonpersonal communication affects buyers directly. In addition, using mass media often affects buyers indirectly by causing more personal communication. For example, communications might first flow from television, magazines, and other mass media to opinion leaders and then from these opinion leaders to others. Thus, opinion leaders step between the mass media and their audiences and carry messages to people who are less exposed to media. Interestingly, marketers often use nonpersonal communication channels to replace or stimulate personal communications by embedding consumer endorsements or word-of-mouth testimonials in their ads and other promotions.

## Selecting the Message Source

In either personal or nonpersonal communication, the message’s impact also depends on how the target audience views the communicator. Messages delivered by highly credible or popular sources are more persuasive. Thus, many food companies promote to doctors, dentists, and other health-care providers to motivate these professionals to recommend specific food products to their patients. And marketers hire celebrity endorsers—well-known athletes, actors, musicians, and even cartoon characters—to deliver their messages. A host of NBA superstars lend their images to brands such as Nike, McDonald’s, and Coca-Cola. Actress Sophia Vergara speaks for CoverGirl, State Farm, Comcast, Rooms to Go, and other brands and has her own Kmart clothing line. Actor George Clooney loves his Nestle Nespresso expresso machine, and tennis great Serena Williams endorses Gatorade, Nike, and Beats By Dre.

But companies must be careful when selecting celebrities to represent their brands. Picking the wrong spokesperson can result in embarrassment and a tarnished image. For example, a dozen or more big brands—including Nike, Anheuser-Busch, Radio Shack, Oakley, Trek bikes, and Giro helmets—faced embarrassment when pro cyclist Lance Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France titles and banned for life from competitive cycling for illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs.
