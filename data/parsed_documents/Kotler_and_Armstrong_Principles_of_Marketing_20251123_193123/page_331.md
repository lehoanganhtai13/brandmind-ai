# 11 Pricing Strategies  
## Additional Considerations

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

In the previous chapter, you learned that price is an important marketing mix tool for both creating and capturing customer value. You explored the three main pricing strategies—customer value–based, cost-based, and competition-based pricing—and the many internal and external factors that affect a firm’s pricing decisions. In this chapter, we’ll look at some additional pricing considerations: new product pricing, product mix pricing, price adjustments, and initiating and reacting to price changes. We close the chapter with a discussion of public policy and pricing.

For openers, let’s examine Apple’s premium pricing strategy. Apple sets its prices substantially above those of even its highest-priced competitors. But Apple’s appeal to customers has never been about prices. Instead, Apple’s vision has always been to provide innovative designs and superior user experiences that make its prices secondary in the minds of customers who covet Apple products.

## APPLE: Premium Priced and Worth It

Apple is the prototypical premium pricer. Whether it’s an iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop, or Apple Watch, customers pay more for an Apple than for competing devices—a lot more. Apple’s iPhone last year sold globally for an average price of $624, compared with $185 for the average Android smartphone. Even compared to Samsung, its closest high-end competitor, the latest iPhone commands a premium of $100 to $200 more than similar Samsung Galaxy models. Similarly, a standard MacBook Pro costs $300 more than a comparable Dell or HP computer.

Yet despite such sky-high prices, Apple’s products continue to fly off shelves, as eager customers get in line to snap up the latest models. For example, Apple sold more than 231 million iPhones last year alone. That leaves Apple in an envious position: It charges the highest prices and still captures market-leading shares in most of its product categories. How does Apple pull that off?

For Apple, success has never been about prices. Instead, it’s been about the Apple user experience. Many tech companies make products that just occupy space and complete the tasks at hand. By contrast, Apple creates “life-feels-good” experiences.

> Under its premium pricing strategy, Apple sets its prices above those of even its highest-priced competitors. Yet Apple’s sales remain hot and its profits even hotter.

Ask Apple users and they’ll tell you that their Apple devices simply work better and are easier to use. And they love Apple’s clean, simple designs that ooze style.

Apple’s obsession with deepening the user experience shows up in everything the company does. From the beginning, Apple has been an innovative leader, churning out one cutting-edge product after another. Making products customers want—usually before consumers themselves even know what they want—has resulted in one Apple-led revolution after another. Apple has always had a genius for wrapping technology beautifully around human needs in a way that puts its customers at the front of the crowd.

In turn, Apple has built a huge corps of avid Apple enthusiasts. For nearly four decades, customers have anointed Apple as the undisputed keeper of all things cool. When you buy an Apple product, you join a whole community of fervent fellow believers. Say the word *Apple* in front of hard-core fans, and they’ll go into raptures about the superiority of the brand. Such enthusiasm and support creates demand for Apple products beyond the limits of price. Not only are Apple fans willing to pay more, they believe deep down that the value they receive is well worth the higher price.
