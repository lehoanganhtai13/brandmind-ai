# Income segmentation  
**Income.** The marketers of products and services such as automobiles, clothing, cosmetics, financial services, and travel have long used **income segmentation**. Many companies target affluent consumers with luxury goods and convenience services. Other marketers use high-touch marketing programs to court the well-to-do. Upscale retailer Saks Fifth Avenue provides exclusive services to its elite clientele of Fifth Avenue Club members, some of whom spend as much as $150,000 to $200,000 a year on clothing and accessories from Saks alone. For example, Fifth Avenue Club members have access to a Saks Personal Stylist. The fashion-savvy, well-connected personal consultant gets to know and helps to shape each client’s personal sense of style, then guides him or her “through the maze of fashion must-haves.” The personal stylist puts the customer first. For example, if Saks doesn’t carry one of those must-haves that the client covets, the personal stylist will find it elsewhere at no added charge.

However, not all companies that use income segmentation target the affluent. For example, many retailers—such as the Dollar General, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree store chains—successfully target low- and middle-income groups. The core market for such stores is represented by families with incomes under $30,000. When Family Dollar real estate experts scout locations for new stores, they look for lower-middle-class neighborhoods where people wear less-expensive shoes and drive old cars that drip a lot of oil. With their low-income strategies, dollar stores are now the fastest-growing retailers in the nation.

# Psychographic Segmentation

**Psychographic segmentation** divides buyers into different segments based on lifestyle or personality characteristics. People in the same demographic group can have very different psychographic characteristics.

In Chapter 5, we discussed how the products people buy reflect their *lifestyles*. As a result, marketers often segment their markets by consumer lifestyles and base their marketing strategies on lifestyle appeals. For example, retailer Anthropologie, with its whimsical, “French flea market” store atmosphere, sells a Bohemian-chic lifestyle to which its young women customers aspire. And Athleta sells an urban-active lifestyle to women with its yoga, running, and other athletic clothing along with urban-casual, post-workout apparel.

Royal Dutch Gazelle produces several types of bikes for different kinds of customers. City bikes are made for short trips to nearby locations, to work, or for a regular shopping trip. blue dot Gazelle also produces a traditional city bike known as the Robust Classic. Trekking bikes are for people who want a sporty and lightweight bike. These bikes come with high-grade components, a sleekly shaped aluminum frame and carbon front fork. The light weight makes for easy transport, so you could take with it you on a holiday trip. Lifestyle bikes, on the other hand, with tough, wide tires and a robust frame, are for the rider to cruise through the town in style. Gazelle also produces e-bikes for daily use, but the Gazelle Ultimate e-bike belongs to a top-flight range: made from lightweight high-end carbon or aluminum parts and frames, it is meant to combine sportiness and speed with great comfort.

Marketers also use *personality* variables to segment markets. For example, ads for Sherwin Williams paint—headlined “Make the most for your color with the very best paint”—seem to appeal to older, more practical do-it-yourself personalities. By contrast, Benjamin Moore’s ads and social media pitches appeal to younger, more outgoing fashion individualists. One Benjamin Moore print ad—consisting of a single long line of text in a crazy quilt of fonts—describes Benjamin Moore’s Hot Lips paint color this way:  
> “It’s somewhere between the color of your lips when you go outside in December with your hair still wet and the color of a puddle left by a melted grape popsicle mixed with the color of that cough syrup that used to make me gag a little. Hot lips. Perfect.”
