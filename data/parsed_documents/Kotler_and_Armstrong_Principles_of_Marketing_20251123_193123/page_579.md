Some 3.6 million Japanese households had a KFC Christmas feast last year. Those who don’t preorder risk standing in lines that snake around the block or having to go without KFC’s coveted blend of 11 herbs and spices altogether. Christmas Eve is KFC’s most successful sales day of the year in Japan, and December monthly sales run as much as 10 times greater than sales in other months.

More fundamentally, the cultural exchange goes both ways: America gets as well as gives cultural influence. True, Hollywood dominates the global movie market, but British TV originated the programming that was Americanized into such hits as *House of Cards*, *Dancing with the Stars*, and *Hell’s Kitchen*. Although Chinese and Russian youth are donning NBA superstar jerseys, the increasing popularity of soccer in America has deep international roots.

Even American childhood has been increasingly influenced by European and Asian cultural imports. Most kids know all about imports such as Hello Kitty, Pokemon, or any of a host of Nintendo or Sega game characters. And J. K. Rowling’s so-very-British Harry Potter books shaped the thinking of a generation of American youngsters, not to mention the millions of American oldsters who fell under their spell as well. For the moment, English remains the dominant language of the internet, and having web and mobile access often means that third-world youth have greater exposure to American popular culture. Yet these same technologies let Eastern European students studying in the United States hear webcast news and music from Poland, Romania, or Belarus.

Thus, globalization is a two-way street. If globalization has Mickey Mouse ears, it is also talking on a Samsung smartphone, buying furniture at IKEA, driving a Toyota Camry, and watching a British-inspired show on a Panasonic OLED TV.

## Deciding Whether to Go Global

Not all companies need to venture into international markets to survive. For example, most local businesses need to market well only in their local marketplaces. Operating domestically is easier and safer. Managers don’t need to learn another country’s language and laws. They don’t have to deal with unstable currencies, face political and legal uncertainties, or redesign their products to suit different customer expectations. However, companies that operate in global industries, where their strategic positions in specific markets are affected strongly by their overall global positions, must compete on a regional or worldwide basis to succeed.

Any of several factors might draw a company into the international arena. For example, global competitors might attack the company’s home market by offering better products or lower prices. The company might want to counterattack these competitors in their home markets to tie up their resources. The company’s customers might be expanding abroad and require international servicing. Or, most likely, international markets might simply provide better opportunities for growth. For example, as noted previously, Coca-Cola has emphasized international growth in recent years to offset stagnant or declining U.S. soft drink sales. Today, non–North America markets account for 80 percent of Coca-Cola’s unit case volume, and the company is making major pushes into 90 emerging markets, such as China, India, and the entire African continent.  

Before going abroad, the company must weigh several risks and answer many questions about its ability to operate globally. Can the company learn to understand the preferences and buyer behavior of consumers in other countries? Can it offer competitively attractive products? Will it be able to adapt to other countries’ business cultures and deal effectively with foreign nationals? Do the company’s managers have the necessary international experience? Has management considered the impact of regulations and the political environments of other countries?

## Deciding Which Markets to Enter

Before going abroad, a company should try to define its international *marketing objectives and policies*. It should decide what *volume* of foreign sales it wants. Most companies start small when they go abroad. Some plan to stay small, seeing international sales as a small part of their business. Other companies have bigger plans, however, seeing international business as equal to—or even more important than—their domestic business.
