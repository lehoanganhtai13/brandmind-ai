# Chapter 8 | Products, Services, and Brands: Building Customer Value

When people view a stunning GoPro video clip—like the one of New Zealand’s Jed Mildon landing the first-ever BMX triple backflip captured by his helmet camera—to some degree, they experience what the subject experiences. They feel the passion and adrenaline. And when that happens, GoPro creates an emotional connection between the GoPro storyteller and the audience.

Thus, making good cameras is only the start of GoPro’s success. GoPro founder Nick Woodman, himself an extreme sports junkie, talks about helping customers through four essential steps in their storytelling and emotion-sharing journeys: capture, creation, broadcast, and recognition. *Capture* is what the cameras do—shooting pictures and videos. *Creation* is the editing and production process that turns raw footage into compelling videos. *Broadcast* involves distributing the video content to an audience. *Recognition* is the payoff for the content creator. Recognition might come in the form of YouTube views or Likes and Shares on Facebook. More probably, it’s the enthusiastic oohs and ahhs that their videos evoke from friends and family. The company’s slogan sums up what it’s really selling: **“GoPro: Be a HERO.”**

Initially, GoPro focused primarily on the capture step of the customer storytelling experience. It offers a seemingly endless supply of rigs, mounts, harnesses, straps, and other accessories that make GoPro cameras wearable or mountable just about anywhere. Users can strap the little cameras to their wrists or mount them on helmets. They can attach them to the tip of a snow ski, the bottom of a skateboard, or the underside of an RC helicopter. In fact, GoPro will soon sell drones—the “ultimate accessory for your GoPro camera”—that will let GoPro enthusiasts take breathtaking videos from on high. The handy little GoPro lets even the rankest video amateur capture some pretty incredible footage.

But to fuel continuing growth, GoPro has broadened its offer to address the full range of customer needs and motivations—not just capture but also creation, broadcast, and recognition. For example, on the creation side, GoPro offers free GoPro Studio software that makes it easier for users to create professional-quality videos from their GoPro content. With the GoPro App, users can “Control. View. Share.”—using their phones, tablets, or Apple Watches to control their GoPros remotely, trim and edit images, and share their favorites wirelessly with friends by text or post or on the GoPro Channel, which is already distributed though social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vimeo, Pinterest, and GoPro.com/Channels. As for recognition, GoPro now airs TV commercials created from the best videos submitted by customers at its website. GoPro’s future lies in enabling and integrating the full user experience, from capturing video to sharing stories and life’s emotions with others.

GoPro’s rich understanding of what product it’s really selling is serving the company well. Its enthusiastic customers are among the most loyal and engaged of any brand. For example, GoPro’s Facebook fan base is more than 9.2 million and growing fast. To put that in perspective, much larger Canon USA has only 1.1 million Facebook followers. Beyond uploading nearly half a million videos a year, GoPro fans interact heavily across a broad range of social media. For example, the GoPro hashtag is used more than 45,000 times daily across major social networks. “I think we have the most socially engaged online audience of any consumer brand in the world,” claims Woodman.

All that customer engagement and enthusiasm have made GoPro the world’s fastest-growing camera company. Today GoPro cameras are available in more than 40,000 stores in more than 100 countries, from small sports-enthusiast shops to REI, Best Buy, and Amazon.com. GoPro’s remarkable little cameras have also spread beyond amateurs. They have become standard equipment for many professional filmmakers—whether it’s the Discovery Channel or a news show team filming rescues, wildlife, and storms or the production crews of hit reality-TV shows such as *Deadliest Catch* taking pictures of underwater crab pots or the sides of ships in heavy seas. When stuntman Felix Baumgartner made his breathtaking 128,000-foot jump from the edge of space, he was wearing five GoPros. The use of GoPro equipment by professionals lends credibility that fuels even greater consumer demand.

The moral of this story: GoPro knows that it doesn’t just sell cameras. More than that, it enables customers to share important moments and emotions. Says Woodman: 

> “We spent a lot of time recently thinking about, What are we really doing here? We know that our cameras are arguably the most socially networked consumer devices of our time, so it’s clear we’re not just building hardware.” 

The company sums it up this way: 

> “Dream it. Do it. Capture it with your GoPro. Capture and share your world.”
