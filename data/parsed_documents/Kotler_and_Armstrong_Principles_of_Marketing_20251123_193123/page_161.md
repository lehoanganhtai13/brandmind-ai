# Subculture

**Subculture**  
A group of people with shared value systems based on common life experiences and situations.

Each culture contains smaller **subcultures**, or groups of people with shared value systems based on common life experiences and situations. Subcultures include nationalities, religions, racial groups, and geographic regions. Many subcultures make up important market segments, and marketers often design products and marketing programs tailored to their needs. Examples of three such important subculture groups are Hispanic American, African American, and Asian American consumers.

### Hispanic American Consumers  
*Hispanics* represent a large, fast-growing market. The nation’s more than 55 million Hispanic consumers (almost one out of every six Americans) have total annual buying power of $1.7 trillion. The U.S. Hispanic population will surge to more than 130 million by 2030, close to one-third of the total U.S. population. Hispanics are a youthful segment—more than 52 percent of U.S. Hispanics are below age 30. Within the Hispanic market, there exist many distinct subsegments based on nationality, age, income, and other factors. A company’s product or message may be more relevant to one nationality over another, such as Mexicans, Costa Ricans, Argentineans, or Cubans.

Although Hispanic consumers share many characteristics and behaviors with the mainstream buying public, there are also distinct differences. They tend to be deeply family oriented and make shopping a family affair—children have a big say in what brands they buy. Older, first-generation Hispanic consumers tend to be very brand loyal and to favor brands and sellers who show special interest in them. Younger Hispanics, however, have shown increasing price sensitivity in recent years and a willingness to switch to store brands. Befitting their youthfulness, Hispanics are more active on mobile and social networks than other segments, making digital media ideal for reaching this segment.

Companies ranging from P&G, McDonald’s, AT&T, Walmart, and State Farm to Google, L’Oréal, and many others have developed special targeting efforts for this fast-growing consumer segment. For example, working with its longtime Hispanic advertising agency Conill, Toyota has developed numerous Hispanic marketing campaigns that have helped make it the favorite automobile brand among Hispanic buyers. Consider its recent award-winning “Más Que un Auto” campaign:

> Last fall, to celebrate its 10th year as America’s most-loved auto brand among Hispanics, Toyota ran a Hispanic campaign themed “Más Que un Auto” (translation: “More than a Car”). The campaign appealed to Hispanics’ special love for their cars and their penchant for giving everything and anything a superpersonal nickname, including their cars.  
>  
> The campaign offered Hispanic customers free nameplates featuring their unique car names, made with the same typeface and materials as the official Toyota nameplates. Now, along with the Toyota and model names, they could adorn their cars with personalized, official-looking brand badges of their own—whether Pepe, El Niño, Trueno (“Thunder”), Monster, or just plain Oliver, Ellie, or Rolly the Corolla.

The award-winning “Más Que un Auto” campaign created a strong emotional connection between Hispanics and their Toyotas. Within the first few months, customers had ordered more than 100,000 customer nameplates, far exceeding the goal of 25,000. Brand fans by the thousands posted pictures and shared their car love stories on campaign sites and other social media. Toyota is now shaping new phases of the “Más Que un Auto” campaign, such as turning some of the fan car stories into ads or asking customers to imagine what a how commercial featuring their beloved ride might look and then picking the best idea to produce for a real broadcast ad.

### African American Consumers  
The U.S. *African American* population is growing in affluence and sophistication. The nation’s more than 44 million black consumers wield almost $1.3 trillion in annual buying power. Although more price conscious than other segments, blacks are also strongly motivated by quality and selection. Brands are important. African American
