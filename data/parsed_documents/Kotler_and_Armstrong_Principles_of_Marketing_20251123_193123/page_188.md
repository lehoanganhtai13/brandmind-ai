# Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

Instead, it added a full slate of integrated information technology, software, and business consulting services. Most recently, to meet customers’ ever-changing digital needs, IBM has shifted even more deeply into data analytics, cloud computing, cybersecurity, social networking, and mobile technology solutions.

Thus, customers can still buy mainframe computers from IBM, but they are more likely to buy solutions involving a complex, integrated mix of hardware, software, services, consulting, and advice across collaborative online, mobile, and social networks. The transformed IBM now works arm-in-arm with B-to-B customers on everything from assessing, planning, designing, and implementing their data and analytics systems to actually running those systems for customers.

According to IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, the company’s focus on working closely with customers and changing to meet their needs is what makes IBM special. “We’re 104 years old,” she says. “The reason we’re the only tech company still here at 104 is how many times we’ve transformed.” IBM’s customer-solutions focus is summed up by its new marketing campaign: “Cognitive Business: Outthink.” The campaign positions IBM as a company that helps customers to “outthink your challenges, competitors, and limits” in the new “cognitive era.”

But good B-to-B marketing at IBM goes well beyond a high-level customer-solutions mission, sweeping transformations, and imaginative positioning campaigns. At the most basic level, it involves “boots on the ground”—IBM teams and individuals developing close day-in, day-out working relationships with customers.

Consider the classic example of IBMer Vivek Gupta and how he became IBM’s top salesperson in its fastest-growing industry (telecommunications) and fastest-growing market (India). When Gupta first joined IBM some years ago, he struggled to gain a foothold in a market where more than 70 percent of corporations are family controlled and where relationships, trust, and family ties trump almost everything else. In addition to his formal IBM training, Gupta launched his own extensive investigative effort, getting to know people, learning about IBM and its customers, and developing a rock-solid knowledge of how the company’s products and services fit customer needs.

When Gupta first approached potential customer Vodafone—the dominant firm in India’s exploding mobile phone market—the managing director there told him, “I don’t do any business with IBM, and I don’t intend to.” But the quietly determined Gupta kept at it, getting to know Vodafone’s key decision makers and patiently listening, observing, and identifying how IBM might be able to help Vodafone succeed in its volatile and competitive markets.

Gupta came to know more about Vodafone than many people who worked there. It took him nearly four years, but

Gupta finally sold Vodafone—the same people who vowed never to do business with IBM—on a gigantic five-year, $600 million turnkey contract to handle everything from Vodafone’s customer service to its finances. Gupta became such a well-known figure at Vodafone’s offices in Mumbai that many people there were surprised that his badge said “IBM” and not “Vodafone.” Gupta thrives on rooting out customer problems to solve. “You have to understand [customers’] pain points,” he explains. “And they are not going to spell them out.”

Flush with success, Gupta set his sights on still bigger targets. He realized that many big Indian telecoms were so busy simply hammering out their basic back-office operating systems that they had little money and brainpower left for strategy, branding, and marketing. However, IBM had all the technology and expertise required to build and maintain such systems. What if IBM were to take over managing the system innards, freeing the customer to attend to strategy and marketing? Gupta proposed just such a novel solution to Bharti Airtel, then a relative newcomer to India’s wireless industry. The result: IBM now runs the bulk of Bharti Airtel’s back-office operations, while Bharti Airtel focuses on taking care of its own customers. In the first five years, the deal produced an incredible $1 billion for IBM. Bharti Airtel is now India’s wireless industry leader and the deal is a staple “how-to” case study in IBM’s emerging markets sales training.

The IBM and Vivek Gupta stories highlight the essentials of B-to-B marketing success. It starts with a customer-focused mission that translates down to individuals working closely with customers to find complete solutions. Gupta doesn’t just sell IBM computer hardware, software, and analytics. He works with customers, feels their pain, finds solutions, and sells the IBM systems and people that will deliver results for the customer. “It’s at once radically simple and just plain radical,” says an analyst. “He wants to convince you that IBM can run your business—your entire business, save for strategy and marketing—better than you can.” | OBJECTIVE 6-1 | Define the business market and explain how business markets differ from consumer markets.
