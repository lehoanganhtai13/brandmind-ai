## Marketing environment

The actors and forces outside marketing that affect marketing management’s ability to build and maintain successful relationships with target customers.

A company’s **marketing environment** consists of the actors and forces outside marketing that affect marketing management’s ability to build and maintain successful relationships with target customers. Like Kellogg, companies must constantly watch and adapt to the changing environment—or, in many cases, lead those changes.

More than any other group in the company, marketers must be environmental trend trackers and opportunity seekers.
