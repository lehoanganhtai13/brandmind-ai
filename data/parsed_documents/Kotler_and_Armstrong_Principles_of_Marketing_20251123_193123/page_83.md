They talk with engineering about product design, with manufacturing about production and inventory levels, and with finance about funding and cash flows. They also connect with outside people, such as advertising agencies to plan ad campaigns and the news media to obtain publicity support. The sales force urges and supports independent John Deere dealers and large retailers like Lowe’s in their efforts to convince residential, agricultural, and industrial customers that “Nothing Runs Like a Deere.”

# Marketing Department Organization

The company must design a marketing organization that can carry out marketing strategies and plans. If the company is very small, one person might do all the research, selling, advertising, customer service, and other marketing work. As the company expands, however, a marketing department emerges to plan and carry out marketing activities.

In large companies, this department contains many specialists—product and market managers, sales managers and salespeople, market researchers, and advertising and social media experts, among others.

To head up such large marketing organizations, many companies have now created a *chief marketing officer* (or CMO) position. This person heads up the company’s entire marketing operation and represents marketing on the company’s top management team. The CMO position puts marketing on equal footing with other “C-level” executives, such as the chief operating officer (COO) and the chief financial officer (CFO). As a member of top management, the CMO’s role is to champion the customer’s cause—to be the “chief customer officer.” To that end, British Airways even went so far as to rename its top marketing position as Director of Customer Experience.¹³

Modern marketing departments can be arranged in several ways. The most common form of marketing organization is the *functional organization*, under which different marketing activities are headed by a functional specialist—a sales manager, an advertising manager, a marketing research manager, a customer service manager, or a new product manager. A company that sells across the country or internationally often uses a *geographic organization*, assigning sales and marketing people to specific countries, regions, and districts. Companies with many very different products or brands often create a *product management organization*. For companies that sell one product line to many different types of markets and customers who have different needs and preferences, a *market* or *customer management organization* might be best. Large companies that produce many different products flowing into many different geographic and customer markets usually employ some *combination* of the functional, geographic, product, and market organization forms.

Marketing organization has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. More and more, companies are shifting their brand management focus toward *customer management*—moving away from managing only product or brand profitability and toward managing customer profitability and customer equity. They think of themselves not as managing portfolios of brands but as managing portfolios of customers. And rather than managing the fortunes of a brand, they see themselves as managing customer-brand engagement, experiences, and relationships.

# Marketing Control

Because many surprises occur during the implementation of marketing strategies and plans, marketers must practice constant **marketing control**—evaluating results and taking corrective action to ensure that the objectives are attained. Marketing control involves
