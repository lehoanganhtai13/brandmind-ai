As a marketing tool, blogs offer some advantages. They can offer a fresh, original, personal, and cheap way to enter into consumer online and social media conversations. However, the blogosphere is cluttered and difficult to control. And although companies can sometimes leverage blogs to engage customers in meaningful relationships, blogs remain largely a consumer-controlled medium. Whether or not they actively participate in the blogs, companies should monitor and listen to them. Marketers can use insights from consumer online conversations to improve their marketing programs.

# Social Media and Mobile Marketing

## Social Media Marketing

As we’ve discussed throughout the text, the surge in internet usage and digital technologies and devices has spawned a dazzling array of online **social media** and other digital communities. Countless independent and commercial social networks have arisen where people congregate to socialize and share messages, opinions, pictures, videos, and other content. These days, it seems, almost everyone is buddying up on Facebook or Google+, checking in with Twitter, tuning into the day’s hottest videos at YouTube, pinning images on social scrapbooking site Pinterest, or sharing photos with Instagram and Snapchat. And, of course, wherever consumers congregate, marketers will surely follow.

Most marketers are now riding the huge social media wave. According to one survey, 92 percent of U.S. companies now claim that social media marketing is important for their businesses.^(23) Interestingly, just as marketers are now learning how to use social media to engage customers, the social media themselves are learning how to make their communities a suitable platform for marketing content, in a way that benefits both social media users and brands. Most social media, even the most successful ones, still face a monetization issue: How can they profitably tap the marketing potential of their massive communities to make money without driving off loyal users (see Real Marketing 17.1)?

### Using Social Media

Marketers can engage in social media in two ways: They can use existing social media or they can set up their own. Using existing social media seems the easiest. Thus, most brands—large and small—have set up shop on a host of social media sites. Check the websites of brands ranging from Coca-Cola, Nike, and Victoria’s Secret to the Chicago Bulls or even the U.S. Forest Service and you’ll find links to each brand’s Facebook, Google+, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, or other social media pages. Such social media can create substantial brand communities. For example, the Chicago Bulls have more than 18 million Facebook fans; Coca-Cola has an eye-popping 97 million Facebook fans.

Some of the major social networks are huge. Nearly 1.6 billion people access Facebook every month, almost five times the population of the United States. Twitter has more than 305 million active monthly users. And YouTube’s more than 1 billion users upload 500 hours of video every minute of every day. The list goes on: Google+ has 359 million active users, Instagram 400 million, LinkedIn 100 million, and Pinterest 100 million.^(24)

Although these large, general-interest social media networks grab most of the headlines, countless niche and interest-based social media have also emerged. These online social networks cater to the needs of smaller communities of like-minded people, making them ideal vehicles for marketers who want to target special-interest groups. There’s at least one social media network for just about every interest, hobby, or group.
