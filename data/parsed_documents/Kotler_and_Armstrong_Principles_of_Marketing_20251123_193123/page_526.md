# Mobile Marketing

Marketers use mobile marketing to engage customers anywhere, anytime during the buying and relationship-building processes. The widespread adoption of mobile devices and the surge in mobile web traffic have made mobile marketing a must for most brands.

With the recent proliferation of mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets, mobile device penetration is now greater than 100 percent in the United States (many people possess more than one mobile device). Almost 70 percent of people in the United States own a smartphone and nearly half of all U.S. households are currently mobile-only households with no landline phone. The mobile apps market has exploded globally: There are more than 3 million apps available, and the average smartphone has 11 to 20 apps installed on it.  

Most people love their phones and rely heavily on them. According to one study, nearly 90 percent of consumers who own smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs would give up all of those other screens before giving up their phones. On average, Americans check their phones 46 times a day—74 times a day for 18- to 24-year-olds—and spend three hours and 40 minutes a day using apps, talking, texting, and browsing the web. Thus, although TV is still a big part of people’s lives, mobile is rapidly becoming their “first screen.” Away from home, it’s their only screen.

For consumers, a smartphone or tablet can be a handy shopping companion. It can provide on-the-go product information, price comparisons, advice and reviews from other consumers, and access to instant deals and digital coupons. One recent study found that 90 percent of smartphone-toting shoppers have used their phone while shopping. Not surprisingly, then, more than 42 percent of all e-commerce purchases are made on mobile devices. Mobile provides a rich platform for engaging consumers more deeply as they move through the buying process with tools ranging from mobile ads, coupons, and texts to apps and mobile websites.

Mobile advertising spending in the United States is surging. It grew 66 percent last year alone and will more than double during the next four years. Mobile ad spending is expected to overtake TV ad spending by 2020. Almost every major marketer—from Nike, P&G, and Macy’s to your local supermarket to nonprofits such as the Red Cross—is now integrating mobile marketing into its direct marketing programs.

Companies use mobile marketing to stimulate immediate buying, make shopping easier, enrich the brand experience, or all of these (see Real Marketing 17.2). It lets marketers provide consumers with information, incentives, and choices at the moment they are expressing an interest or when they are most likely to make a buying choice. For example, Taco Bell uses mobile advertising to reach consumers at what it calls mobile “moments that matter.”

> As part of its ongoing push to promote Taco Bell for breakfast, the chain uses carefully targeted mobile advertising to reach consumers just as they are starting their day. It targets mobile ads based on specific behaviors such as which apps consumers use first in the morning, their favorite news apps, or what time of day they’ve looked at a breakfast recipe. “We’re weaving into morning behaviors,” says a Taco Bell marketer.  
>  
> 🔵 Taco Bell also targets mobile ads geographically using navigation and traffic apps such as Google’s Waze to zero in on specific customer locations, even providing step-by-step directions to nearby stores. In these ways, Taco Bell can customize mobile ads according to each customer’s actions, experiences, and environment. In marketing its breakfasts, says the marketer, mobile lets Taco Bell be “present on experiences that consumers turn to when they first open their eyes in the morning.”
