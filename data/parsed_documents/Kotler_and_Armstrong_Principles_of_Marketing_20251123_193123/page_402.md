# Retailing and Wholesaling

For example, Trader Joe’s has established its “cheap gourmet” value proposition. Walmart is powerfully positioned on low prices and what those always-low prices mean to its customers. And highly successful outdoor products retailer Bass Pro Shops positions itself strongly as being “as close to the Great Outdoors as you can get indoors!”

With solid targeting and positioning, a retailer can compete effectively against even the largest and strongest competitors. ● For example, compare small In-N-Out Burger to giant McDonald’s. In-N-Out now has only about 300 stores in five states, with estimated sales of $750 million. McDonald’s has 36,000 stores in more than 100 countries, racking up more than $98 billion of annual system-wide sales. How does In-N-Out compete with the world’s largest fast-food chain? It doesn’t—at least not directly. In-N-Out succeeds by carefully positioning itself *away* from McDonald’s:[^14]

> In-N-Out has never wanted to be like McDonald’s, growing rapidly and expanding both its menu and locations. Instead, In-N-Out thrives by doing the unthinkable: growing slowly and not changing. From the start, In-N-Out’s slogan has been, “Quality you can taste.” Burgers are made from 100 percent pure beef—no additives, fillers, or preservatives—and they’re always fresh, not frozen. Fries are made from whole potatoes, and, yes, milkshakes are made from real ice cream. You won’t find a freezer, heating lamp, or microwave oven in an In-N-Out restaurant. And unlike

> McDonald’s unending stream of new menu items, In-N-Out stays with what the chain has always done well: making really good hamburgers, really good fries, and really good shakes—that’s it.  
>  
> Moreover, far from standardized fare, In-N-Out gladly customizes any menu item. Menu modifications have become so common at In-N-Out that a “secret” ordering code has emerged that isn’t posted on menu boards. Customers in the know can order their burgers “animal style” (pickles, extra spread, grilled onions, and a mustard-fried patty). And whereas the “Double-Double” (double meat, double cheese) is on the menu, burgers can also be ordered 3 × 3 or 4 × 4. Fries can also be ordered animal style (two slices of cheese, grilled onions, and spread), well-done, or light. This secret menu makes customers feel special. Another thing that makes them feel special is In-N-Out’s outgoing, enthusiastic, and capable employees who deliver unexpectedly friendly service. You won’t find that at McDonald’s. Finally, in contrast to McDonald’s obsession to grow, grow, grow; In-N-Out’s slow-and-steady growth means that you won’t find one on every corner. The scarcity of In-N-Out stores only adds to its allure. Customers regularly go out of their way and drive long distances to get their In-N-Out fix.

So, In-N-Out can’t match McDonald’s massive economies of scale, incredible volume purchasing power, ultra-efficient logistics, and low prices. Then again, it doesn’t even try. By positioning itself away from McDonald’s and other large competitors, In-N-Out has developed a cult-like following. When it comes to customer satisfaction, In-N-Out regularly posts the highest customer satisfaction scores of any fast-food restaurant in its markets. Long lines snake out the door of any location at lunchtime and In-N-Out’s average per-store sales are double the industry average.

## Product Assortment and Services Decision

Retailers must decide on three major product variables: product assortment, services mix, and store atmosphere.

The retailer’s *product assortment* should differentiate it while matching target shoppers’ expectations. One strategy is to offer a highly targeted product assortment: Lane Bryant carries plus-size clothing, Brookstone offers an unusual assortment of gadgets and gifts, and BatteryDepot.com offers about every imaginable kind of replacement battery. Alternatively, a retailer can differentiate itself by offering merchandise that no other competitor carries, such as store brands or national brands on which it holds exclusive rights.
