Unlike its Western counterparts, Alibaba developed and acquired different online sites and established major divisions. For example, Taobao.com is a site that helps small businesses and private parties sell merchandise to customers. But unlike eBay’s commission structure, Taobao sellers pay only for the advertised promotion. From a shopping standpoint, Alibaba’s Tmall.com is more similar to Amazon, pairing customers with big corporations, including many global corporations such as Nike, P&G, Apple, and even retailers like Costco.

But Alibaba’s development has taken it down numerous other paths as well. And although it may seem that the surging Chinese conglomerate is simply playing copycat, Ma’s vision plays out creatively in every case. For example, Alipay is similar to PayPal. But starved for investment opportunities in an environment dominated by state-run banks, Alipay customers have access to financial products that pay attractive returns. In the first year of making such options available, Alipay customers tucked away $82 billion.

In another example of “follow the Silicon Valley guru,” the soon-to-be-launched Tmall Box Office—or TBO—“aims to become [the equivalent] of Netflix in the U.S.,” including plans to run original content produced by Alibaba’s own Alibaba Pictures. But in an environment where TV viewers aren’t accustomed to the pay-to-watch model, Alibaba is a true pioneer. And that pioneering effort extends to a crowdsourced film investment fund, a model that threatens to upend traditional film financing in China by allowing regular folks to become producers with less risk.

Alibaba has spent billions investing in start-up firms. Today, the Alibaba Group spreads out over a constellation of services and technologies, including music, gaming, blogs, social networks, event ticket sales, shipping, ridesharing, wearables, and smartphones. On well-known U.S. interests, Alibaba has invested $200 million in Snapchat and $1 billion in Lyft, and it recently bought up 5.6 percent of languishing Groupon. Apparently, Mr. Ma sees something in the daily deals market that others don’t.

As Alibaba’s list of businesses grows, Ma’s vision and innovation seem unbounded. After all, how many U.S. internet veterans can say they started their own holiday? Just seven years ago, Ma enthusiastically launched Singles Day on November 11. What started as a sort of anti-Valentine’s Day for single people is now one of the biggest blockbuster sales holidays in the world. Last year, it resulted in $14.3 billion in sales in a 24-hour period, almost five times what fanatical U.S. residents spent on Cyber Monday across all ecommerce companies combined.

With a goal of doubling its current revenues by 2020, one frontier looms large for Alibaba—global expansion. Although China’s biggest dot.com success certainly has global ambitions, it has so far chosen to focus on the massive potential of its home market. That will change. “We plan to invest more in [the U.S. and U.K. markets] to get more traffic and…build brand awareness,” says Joe Yan, director of international B2C at Alibaba’s export division. “Our biggest advantage is abundance—with 100 million products, we have more options for customers who can buy our products cheaper and at high quality.” And while it remains to be seen how Alibaba will attack global markets, one analyst recently predicted a future marriage down the road of Alibaba and eBay.

At the same time, U.S. companies such as Netflix and Amazon are exploring ways to expand their small presence in China. However, although the massive markets on both sides of the pond represent opportunities too tempting to pass up, only time will tell whether any of these U.S. companies can export the models they have applied so successfully in their home markets.

As U.S. competitors try to counter Alibaba, they will face one more big hurdle. The Chinese love Jack Ma. For their own part, U.S. tech founders such as Bezos, Zuckerberg, Brin and Page, and the late Steve Jobs are considered visionaries who have shaped the world’s digital ecosystem. But the Chinese revere Mr. Ma, the man who turned a local underdog into a dominant giant with revenues bigger than Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple combined. Those kinds of patriotic emotions will be tough to crack.
