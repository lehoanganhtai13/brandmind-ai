# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Consequently, the chain does not have to slash prices, as rivals often do, to move mass quantities of out-of-season stock.

Zara has grown with little or no advertising, and it has been observed that it hardly even has a marketing department. Instead of spending money on TV spots or print ads, the company invests heavily in the design, appeal, and location of its shops, which are the best display and advertisement for Zara and its brand image. Zara’s flexibility and speed has helped the fashion retailer to expand and grow steadily. In the last few years, like-for-like sales have grown by 17 percent and Zara wants to expand its shop space by 8 to 10 percent every year for the next three to five years.

Zara continues to enhance its amazing channel management system and disintermediation strategy, which has left thousands of fashion retailers worldwide pop-eyed. It is the prototype of the “fast-fashion” retailer. Daniel Piette, the chairman of LVMH Investment Funds and the former fashion director for the luxury house that owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Hublot has hailed Zara as possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer.

Stacey Cartwright, former CFO of Burberry Group plc, stated that Zara is a fantastic case study of how to get products to the stores at amazing speeds; indeed, Burberry has an eye on their techniques. The so-called Spanish success story has reset the boundaries for what shoppers expect from a high-street clothing store and promises to continue to thrive as one of the world’s biggest fashion retailers.

Amazon.com almost single-handedly bankrupted Borders in less than 10 years. Now, both offline and online sellers of physical books are being threatened by digital book downloads and e-readers. Rather than yielding to digital developments, however, Amazon.com is leading them with its highly successful Kindle e-readers and tablets. By contrast, Barnes & Noble—the giant that put so many independent bookstores out of business—was a latecomer with its struggling Nook e-reader and now finds itself locked in a battle for survival.[10]

Like resellers, to remain competitive, product and service producers must develop new channel opportunities, such as the internet and other direct channels. However, developing these new channels often brings them into direct competition with their established channels, resulting in conflict. To ease this problem, companies often look for ways to make going direct a plus for the entire channel.

For example, Volvo Car Group (now owned by Chinese car maker Geeley) recently announced plans to start selling Volvo vehicles online in all of its markets. Some 80 percent of Volvo buyers already shop online for other goods, so cars seem like a natural extension. Few auto makers have tried selling directly, with the exception of Tesla, which sells its all-electric cars online, bypassing dealers altogether. Other car companies worry that selling directly would alienate their independent dealer networks. “If you say e-commerce, initially dealers get nervous,” says Volvo’s head of marketing. So, to avoid channel conflicts, Volvo will pass all online sales through established dealers for delivery. In that way, boosting sales through direct marketing will benefit both Volvo and its channel partners.[11]

## Channel Design Decisions

We now look at several channel design decisions manufacturers face. In designing marketing channels, manufacturers struggle between what is ideal and what is practical. A new firm with limited capital usually starts by selling in a limited market area. In this case, deciding on the best channels might not be a problem: The problem might simply be how to convince one or a few good intermediaries to handle the line.

If successful, the new firm can branch out to new markets through existing intermediaries. In smaller markets, the firm might sell directly to retailers; in larger markets, it might sell through distributors. In one part of the country, it might grant exclusive franchises; in another, it might sell through all available outlets.
