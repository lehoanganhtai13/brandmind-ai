# Table 8.1 Marketing Considerations for Consumer Products

This table outlines marketing considerations for four types of consumer products: Convenience, Shopping, Specialty, and Unsought.  Customer buying behavior varies significantly, from frequent, low-involvement purchases of convenience goods to the strong brand loyalty and special effort required for specialty items, with shopping goods falling in between and unsought goods characterized by low awareness or interest.  Pricing generally increases from convenience to specialty products, while distribution becomes more selective, moving from widespread to exclusive. Promotion strategies also adapt, employing mass promotion for convenience goods, a mix of advertising and personal selling for shopping and specialty items, and aggressive tactics for unsought products. Examples provided illustrate these distinctions, ranging from everyday items like toothpaste to luxury goods and essential services.

## Specialty product  
**Specialty products** are consumer products and services with unique characteristics or brand identifications for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchase effort. Examples include specific brands of cars, high-priced photography equipment, designer clothes, gourmet foods, and the services of medical or legal specialists. A Lamborghini automobile, for example, is a specialty product because buyers are usually willing to travel great distances to buy one. Buyers normally do not compare specialty products. They invest only the time needed to reach dealers carrying the wanted brands.

## Unsought product  
A consumer product that the consumer either does not know about or knows about but does not normally consider buying.

**Unsought products** are consumer products that a consumer either does not know about or knows about but does not normally consider buying. Most major new innovations are unsought until consumers become aware of them through marketing. Classic examples of known but unsought products and services are life insurance, preplanned funeral services, and blood donations to the Red Cross. By their very nature, unsought products require a lot of promoting, personal selling, and other marketing efforts.

## Industrial product  
A product bought by individuals and organizations for further processing or for use in conducting a business.

**Industrial products** are those products purchased for further processing or for use in conducting a business. Thus, the distinction between a consumer product and an industrial product is based on the *purpose* for which the product is purchased. If a consumer buys a lawn mower for use around home, the lawn mower is a consumer product. If the same consumer buys the same lawn mower for use in a landscaping business, the lawn mower is an industrial product.

The three groups of industrial products and services are materials and parts, capital items, and supplies and services. *Materials and parts* include raw materials as well as manufactured materials and parts. Raw materials consist of farm products (wheat, cotton, livestock, fruits, vegetables) and natural products (fish, lumber, crude petroleum, iron ore). Manufactured materials and parts consist of component materials (iron, yarn, cement, wires) and component parts (small motors, tires, castings). Most manufactured materials and parts are sold directly to industrial users. Price and service are the major marketing factors; branding and advertising tend to be less important.
