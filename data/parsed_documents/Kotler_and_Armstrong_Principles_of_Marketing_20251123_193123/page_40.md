# Chapter 1 | Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement

Perceived value: A Steinway piano—any Steinway piano—costs a lot. But to a Steinway customer, it’s a small price to pay for the value of owning one.

Each Steinway from more than 12,000 individual parts requires up to one full year. But, more importantly, owners get the Steinway mystique. The Steinway name evokes images of classical concert stages and the celebrities and performers who’ve owned and played Steinway pianos across more than 160 years. But Steinways aren’t just for world-class pianists and the wealthy. Ninety-nine percent of all Steinway buyers are amateurs who perform only in their dens.

So is a Steinway piano worth its premium price compared with less expensive pianos? To many consumers, the answer is no. ● But to Steinway customers, whatever a Steinway costs, it’s a small price to pay for the value of owning one. As one Steinway user puts it, “A pianist without a Steinway, for me, is the same as a singer without a voice.” Says another, “My friendship with the Steinway piano is one of the most important and beautiful things in my life.” Who can put a price on such feelings?

### Customer satisfaction  
The extent to which a product’s perceived performance matches a buyer’s expectations.

Customer satisfaction depends on the product’s perceived performance relative to a buyer’s expectations. If the product’s performance falls short of expectations, the customer is dissatisfied. If performance matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. If performance exceeds expectations, the customer is highly satisfied or delighted.

Outstanding marketing companies go out of their way to keep important customers satisfied. Most studies show that higher levels of customer satisfaction lead to greater customer loyalty, which in turn results in better company performance. Companies aim to delight customers by promising only what they can deliver and then delivering more than they promise. Delighted customers not only make repeat purchases but also become willing marketing partners and “customer evangelists” who spread the word about their good experiences to others.

For companies interested in delighting customers, exceptional value and service become part of the overall company culture. For example, L.L.Bean—the iconic American outdoor apparel and equipment retailer—was founded on the principle that keeping customers satisfied is the key to building lasting relationships.  

> Year after year, L.L.Bean lands in the top 10 of virtually every list of top service companies, including J.D. Power’s most recent list of “customer service champions.” The customer-service culture runs deep at L.L.Bean. ● More than 100 years ago, Leon Leonwood Bean founded the company on a philosophy of complete customer satisfaction, expressed in the following guarantee:  
> “I do not consider a sale complete until [the] goods are worn out and the customer [is] still satisfied.” To this day, customers can return any item, no questions asked, even decades after purchase.

> The company’s customer-service philosophy is perhaps best summed up in founder L.L.’s answer to the question “What is a customer?” His answer still forms the backbone of the company’s values:  
> “A customer is the most important person ever in this company—in person or by mail. A customer is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him. A customer is not an interruption of our work, he is the purpose of it. We are not doing a favor by serving him, he is doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to do so. A customer is not someone to argue or match wits with. Nobody ever won an argument with a customer. A customer is a person who brings us his wants. It is our job to handle them profitably to him and to ourselves.”  
> Adds former L.L.Bean CEO Leon Gorman: “A lot of people have fancy things to say about customer service, but it’s just a day-in, day-out, ongoing, never-ending, persevering, compassionate kind of activity.”
