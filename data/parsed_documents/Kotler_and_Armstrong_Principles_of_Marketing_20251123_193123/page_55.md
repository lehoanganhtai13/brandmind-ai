# PART 1 | Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process

## FIGURE 1.6  
An Expanded Model of the Marketing Process

This diagram illustrates a five-step process for creating customer value and building relationships, culminating in capturing value from customers. The initial phase, "Create value *for* customers and build customer relationships," encompasses understanding the marketplace and customer needs, designing a customer value-driven marketing strategy, constructing an integrated marketing program, and engaging customers to build profitable relationships and create delight. Each of these steps is further broken down into specific activities: researching customers and the marketplace, managing marketing information, selecting customers through segmentation and targeting, deciding on a value proposition via differentiation and positioning, designing products and services, setting prices, managing distribution, and communicating the value proposition through promotion. Additionally, this overarching process involves harnessing marketing technology, managing global markets, and ensuring environmental and social responsibility. The entire framework is framed by the ultimate goal of "Capture value *from* customers in return," which involves creating profits, customer equity, satisfied and loyal customers, capturing customer lifetime value, and increasing market and customer share.

> This expanded version of Figure 1.1 at the beginning of the chapter provides a good road map for the rest of the text. The underlying concept of the entire text is that marketing creates value for customers in order to capture value from customers in return.

The first four steps of the marketing process focus on creating value for customers. The company first gains a full understanding of the marketplace by researching customer needs and managing marketing information. It then designs a customer-driven marketing strategy based on the answers to two simple questions. The first question is “What consumers will we serve?” (market segmentation and targeting). Good marketing companies know that they cannot serve all customers in every way. Instead, they need to focus their resources on the customers they can serve best and most profitably. The second marketing strategy question is “How can we best serve targeted customers?” (differentiation and positioning). Here, the marketer outlines a value proposition that spells out what values the company will deliver to win target customers.

With its marketing strategy chosen, the company now constructs an integrated marketing program—consisting of a blend of the four marketing mix elements, the four Ps—that transforms the marketing strategy into real value for customers. The company develops product offers and creates strong brand identities for them. It prices these offers to create real customer value and distributes the offers to make them available to target consumers. Finally, the company designs promotion programs that engage target customers, communicate the value proposition, and persuade customers to act on the market offering.

Perhaps the most important step in the marketing process involves building value-laden, profitable relationships with target customers. Throughout the process, marketers practice customer relationship management to create customer satisfaction and delight. They engage customers in the process of creating brand conversations, experiences, and community. In creating customer value and relationships, however, the company cannot go it alone. It must work closely with marketing partners both inside the company and throughout its marketing system. Thus, beyond practicing good customer relationship management and customer-engagement marketing, firms must also practice good partner relationship management.
