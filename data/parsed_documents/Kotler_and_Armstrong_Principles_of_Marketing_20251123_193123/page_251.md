of conformance quality. In this sense, a Chevrolet can have just as much quality as a Rolls-Royce. Although a Chevy doesn’t perform at the same level as a Rolls-Royce, it can just as consistently deliver the quality that customers pay for and expect.

Five Guys is an American fast casual restaurant selling burgers, fries, hot dogs, and grilled sandwiches. Five Guys is famous for ruling the “better burger” category. Their burgers are prepared in peanut oil, are hand-crafted, and are made of freshly ground beef. Five Guys says that it does not compete on price with McDonalds, Burger King, or Wendy’s because their product quality is better, and people will pay a little extra for food if it’s worth it. If ever a customer questions their higher price, they tell the customers to just take it and not pay for it. And they say that in the many years they have done this, every single customer has come back and paid for their food and added a big tip. The level of quality of Five Guys’ burgers supports its positioning and has created a cult following for its burgers around the world.

### Product Features

A product can be offered with varying features. A stripped-down model, one without any extras, is the starting point. The company can then create higher-level models by adding more features. Features are a competitive tool for differentiating the company’s product from competitors’ products. Being the first producer to introduce a valued new feature is one of the most effective ways to compete.

How can a company identify new features and decide which ones to add to its product? It should periodically survey buyers who have used the product and ask these questions: How do you like the product? Which specific features of the product do you like most? Which features could we add to improve the product? The answers to these questions provide the company with a rich list of feature ideas. The company can then assess each feature’s *value* to customers versus its *cost* to the company. Features that customers value highly in relation to costs should be added.

### Product Style and Design

Another way to add customer value is through distinctive *product style and design*. Design is a larger concept than style. *Style* simply describes the appearance of a product. Styles can be eye catching or yawn producing. A sensational style may grab attention and produce pleasing aesthetics, but it does not necessarily make the product *perform* better. Unlike style, *design* is more than skin deep—it goes to the very heart of a product. Good design contributes to a product’s usefulness as well as to its looks.

Good design doesn’t start with brainstorming new ideas and making prototypes. Design begins with observing customers, understanding their needs, and shaping their product-use experience. Product designers should think less about technical product specifications and more about how customers will use and benefit from the product. For example, using smart design based on consumer needs, Sonos created a wireless, internet-enabled speaker system that’s easy to use and fills a whole house with great sound.

> In the past, setting up a whole-house entertainment or sound system required routing wires through walls, floors, and ceilings, creating a big mess and lots of expense. And if you moved, you couldn’t take it with you. Enter Sonos, which took home-audio and theater systems to a new level worthy of the digital age. The innovative company created a wireless speaker system that’s not just stylish but also easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to move to meet changing needs. With Sonos, you can stream high-quality sound through a variety of stylish speakers anywhere in your home with just an app and a tap on your smartphone. Smart design has paid off handsomely for Sonos. Founded in 2002, over just the past two years the company’s sales have nearly tripled to an estimated $1 billion a year.⁸
