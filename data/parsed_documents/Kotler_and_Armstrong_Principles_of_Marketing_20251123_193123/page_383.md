Superior Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Value Chain Innovation
Companies are looking to gain sustainable advantage and drive innovation by transforming their traditional supply chains into integrated value chains. Are you ready for the transformation?
Oracle Corporation
Integrated logistics management: Oracle’s supply chain management software solutions help companies to “gain sustainable advantage and drive innovation by transforming their traditional supply chains into integrated value chains.”

Oracle and SAP to Infor and Logility. For example, Oracle’s supply chain management software solutions help companies to “gain sustainable advantage and drive innovation by transforming their traditional supply chains into integrated value chains.” It coordinates every aspect of the supply chain, from value chain collaboration to inventory optimization to transportation and logistics management. The important thing is that the company must coordinate its logistics, inventory investments, demand forecasting, and marketing activities to create high market satisfaction at a reasonable cost.

## Building Logistics Partnerships

Companies must do more than improve their own logistics. They must also work with other channel partners to improve whole-channel distribution. The members of a marketing channel are linked closely in creating customer value and building customer relationships. One company’s distribution system is another company’s supply system. The success of each channel member depends on the performance of the entire supply chain. For example, furniture retailer IKEA can create its stylish but affordable furniture and deliver the “IKEA lifestyle” only if its entire supply chain—consisting of thousands of merchandise designers and suppliers, transport companies, warehouses, and service providers—operates at maximum efficiency and with customer-focused effectiveness.

Smart companies coordinate their logistics strategies and forge strong partnerships with suppliers and customers to improve customer service and reduce channel costs. Many companies have created *cross-functional, cross-company teams*. For example, Nestlé’s Purina pet food unit has a team of dozens of people working in Bentonville, Arkansas, the home base of Walmart. The Purina Walmart team members work jointly with their counterparts at Walmart to find ways to squeeze costs out of their distribution system. Working together benefits not only Purina and Walmart but also their shared, final consumers.

Other companies partner through *shared projects*. For example, many large retailers conduct joint in-store programs with suppliers. Home Depot allows key suppliers to use its stores as a testing ground for new merchandising programs. The suppliers spend time at Home Depot stores watching how their product sells and how customers relate to it. They then create programs specially tailored to Home Depot and its customers. Clearly, both the supplier and the customer benefit from such partnerships. The point is that all supply chain members must work together in the cause of bringing value to final consumers.

## Third-Party Logistics

Although most big companies love to make and sell their products, many loathe the associated logistics “grunt work.” They detest the bundling, loading, unloading, sorting, storing, reloading, transporting, customs clearing, and tracking required to supply their factories and get products to their customers. They hate it so much that many firms outsource some or all of their logistics to **third-party logistics (3PL) providers** such as Ryder, Penske Logistics, BAX Global, DHL Logistics, FedEx Logistics, and UPS Business Solutions.

> **Third-party logistics (3PL) provider**  
> An independent logistics provider that performs any or all of the functions required to get a client’s product to market.

For example, UPS knows that, for many companies, logistics can be a real nightmare. But logistics is exactly what UPS does best. To UPS, logistics is today’s most powerful force for creating competitive advantage. “We ❤️ logistics,” proclaims UPS. “It makes running your business easier. It can make your customers happier. It’s a whole new way of thinking.” As one UPS ad concludes: “We love logistics. Put UPS to work for you and you’ll love logistics too.”

At one level, UPS can simply handle a company’s package shipments. But on a deeper level, UPS can help businesses sharpen their own logistics systems to cut costs and serve customers better. At a still deeper level, companies can let UPS take over and manage part or all of their logistics operations. For example, consumer electronics maker Toshiba lets UPS handle its entire laptop PC repair process—lock, stock, and barrel.
