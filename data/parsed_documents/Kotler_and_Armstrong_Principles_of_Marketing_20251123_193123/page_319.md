# Overall Marketing Strategy, Objectives, and Mix

Price is only one element of the company’s broader marketing strategy. So, before setting price, the company must decide on its overall marketing strategy for the product or service. Sometimes, a company’s overall strategy is built around its price and value story.  
● For example, grocery retailer Trader Joe’s unique price-value positioning has made it one of the nation’s fastest-growing, most popular food stores:⁸

Trader Joe’s has put its own special twist on the food price-value equation—call it “cheap gourmet.” It offers gourmet-caliber, one-of-a-kind products at bargain prices, all served up in a festive, vacation-like atmosphere that makes shopping fun. Trader Joe’s is a gourmet foodie’s delight, featuring everything from kettle corn cookies, organic strawberry lemonade, creamy Valencia peanut butter, and fair-trade coffees to kimchi fried rice and triple-ginger ginger snaps. If asked, almost any customer can tick off a ready list of Trader Joe’s favorites that he or she just can’t live without—a list that quickly grows.  
The assortment is uniquely Trader Joe’s—90 percent of the store’s brands are private labels. The prices aren’t all that low in absolute terms, but they’re a real bargain compared with what you’d pay for the same quality and coolness elsewhere. “It’s not complicated,” says Trader Joe’s. “We just focus on what matters—great food + great prices = value. So you can afford to be adventurous without breaking the bank.” Trader Joe’s inventive price-value positioning has earned it an almost cult-like following of devoted customers who love what they get from Trader Joe’s for the prices they pay.

Finding that magical price-value trade-off can be very difficult, and pricing strategies often require regular realignment to meet changes in the pricing environment. Just ask Trader Joe’s competitor Whole Foods Market, which pretty much invented the upscale organic and natural foods supermarket concept. In recent years Whole Foods Market’s pricing strategy has been a constant work in progress as the company struggles to find the right price-value equation (see Real Marketing 10.2).  
If a company has selected its target market and positioning carefully, then its marketing mix strategy, including price, will be fairly straightforward. For example, Amazon positions its Kindle Fire tablet as offering the same (or even more) for less and prices it at 40 percent less than Apple’s iPads and Samsung’s Galaxy tablets. It recently began targeting families with young children, positioning the Kindle Fire as the “perfect family tablet,” with models priced as low as $99, bundled with Kindle FreeTime, an all-in-one subscription service starting at $2.99 per month that brings together books, games, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for kids ages 3 through 8. Thus, the Kindle pricing strategy is largely determined by decisions on market positioning.  
Pricing may play an important role in helping to accomplish company objectives at many levels. A firm can set prices to attract new customers or profitably retain existing ones. It can set prices low to prevent competition from entering the market or set prices at competitors’ levels to stabilize the market. It can price to keep the loyalty and support of resellers or avoid government intervention. Prices can be reduced temporarily to create excitement for a brand. Or one product may be priced to help the sales of other products in the company’s line.  
Price decisions must be coordinated with product design, distribution, and promotion decisions to form a consistent and effective integrated marketing mix program. Decisions made for other marketing mix variables may affect pricing decisions. For example, a Whole Foods Market practically invented the upscale, socially responsible supermarket concept.
