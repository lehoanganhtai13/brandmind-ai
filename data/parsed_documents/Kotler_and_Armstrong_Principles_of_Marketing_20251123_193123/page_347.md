# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

First, it could *reduce its price* to match the competitor’s price. It may decide that the market is price sensitive and that it would lose too much market share to the lower-priced competitor. However, cutting the price will reduce the company’s profits in the short run. Some companies might also reduce their product quality, services, and marketing communications to retain profit margins, but this will ultimately hurt long-run market share. The company should try to maintain its quality as it cuts prices.

Alternatively, the company might maintain its price but *raise the perceived value* of its offer. It could improve its communications, stressing the relative value of its product over that of the lower-price competitor. The firm may find it cheaper to maintain price and spend money to improve its perceived value than to cut price and operate at a lower margin. Or the company might *improve quality* and *increase price*, moving its brand into a higher price–value position. The higher quality creates greater customer value, which justifies the higher price. In turn, the higher price preserves the company’s higher margins.

Finally, the company might launch a low-price *“fighter brand”*—adding a lower-price item to the line or creating a separate lower-price brand. This is necessary if the particular market segment being lost is price sensitive and will not respond to arguments of higher quality.  
Starbucks did this when it acquired Seattle’s Best Coffee, a brand positioned with working-class, “approachable-premium” appeal compared to the more professional, full-premium appeal of the main Starbucks brand. Seattle’s Best coffee is generally cheaper than the parent Starbucks brand. As such, at retail, it competes more directly with Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s, and other mass-premium brands through its franchise outlets and through partnerships with Subway, Burger King, Delta, AMC theaters, Royal Caribbean cruise lines, and others. On supermarket shelves, it competes with store brands and other mass-premium coffees such as Folgers Gourmet Selections and Millstone.

To counter store brands and other low-price entrants in a tighter economy, P&G turned a number of its brands into fighter brands. Luvs disposable diapers give parents “premium leakage protection for less than pricier brands.” And P&G offers popular budget-priced basic versions of several of its major brands. For example, Charmin Basic “holds up at a great everyday price,” and Puffs Basic gives you “Everyday softness. Everyday value.” Tide Simply Clean & Fresh is about 35 percent cheaper than regular Tide detergent—it’s “tough on odors and easy on your wallet.” However, companies must use caution when introducing fighter brands, as such brands can tarnish the image of the main brand. In addition, although they may attract budget buyers away from lower-priced rivals, they can also take business away from the firm’s higher-margin brands.

> Pricing decisions are often constrained by social and legal issues. For example, think about the pharmaceuticals industry. Are rapidly rising prescription drug prices justified? Or are the drug companies unfairly lining their pockets by gouging consumers who have few alternatives? Should the government step in?

## Public Policy and Pricing

Price competition is a core element of our free-market economy. In setting prices, companies usually are not free to charge whatever prices they wish. Many federal, state, and even local laws govern the rules of fair play in pricing. In addition, companies must consider broader societal pricing concerns. In setting their prices, for example, pharmaceutical firms must balance their development costs and profit objectives against the sometimes life-and-death needs of prescription drug consumers (see Real Marketing 11.2).
