FIGURE 15.1 Major Advertising Decisions

This table outlines a structured approach to advertising management, moving from initial objective setting through to evaluation. The process begins with defining clear Objectives setting, encompassing both Communication objectives and Sales objectives. Subsequently, Budget decisions are made, employing various methods such as the Affordable approach, Percent of sales, Competitive parity, and the Objective and task method. Following budget allocation, Message decisions are crucial, involving the development of a Message strategy and its Message execution. This leads into Media decisions, which cover Media strategy, Impact and engagement considerations, selection of Major media types and Specific media vehicles, and Media timing. Finally, the entire process culminates in Advertising evaluation, assessing Communication impact, Sales and profit impact, and ultimately, the Return on advertising investment. This represents a sequential, decision-driven framework for advertising planning and execution.

> Don’t forget—advertising is only part of a broader set of marketing and company decisions. Its job is to help communicate the brand’s value proposition to target customers. Advertising must blend well with other promotion and marketing mix decisions.

# Major Advertising Decisions

## Setting Advertising Objectives

The first step is to set *advertising objectives*. These objectives should be based on past decisions about the target market, positioning, and the marketing mix, which define the job that advertising must do in the total marketing program. The overall advertising objective is to help engage customers and build customer relationships by communicating customer value. Here, we discuss specific advertising objectives.

An **advertising objective** is a specific communication *task* to be accomplished with a specific *target* audience during a specific period of *time*. Advertising objectives can be classified by their primary purpose—to *inform*, *persuade*, or *remind*. Table 15.1 lists examples of each of these specific objectives.

*Informative advertising* is used heavily when introducing a new product category. In this case, the objective is to build primary demand. Thus, early producers of big-screen HDTVs first had to inform consumers of the image quality and size benefits of the new product. *Persuasive advertising* becomes more important as competition increases. Here, the company’s objective is to build selective demand. For example, once HDTVs became established,

Table 15.1 outlines three primary categories of advertising objectives: Informative, Persuasive, and Reminder. Informative advertising focuses on communicating customer value, introducing new products, explaining product functionality, suggesting new uses, announcing price changes, describing services, and correcting misconceptions. Persuasive advertising aims to build brand preference, encourage brand switching, alter perceptions of product value, prompt immediate purchases, foster customer engagement, and cultivate a brand community. Reminder advertising seeks to maintain customer relationships, remind consumers where to purchase, and keep the brand top-of-mind, particularly during off-seasons or when the product might be needed soon. The structure is hierarchical, with the three main objective types branching into specific tactical goals. Samsung began trying to persuade consumers that *its* brand offered the best quality for their money.
