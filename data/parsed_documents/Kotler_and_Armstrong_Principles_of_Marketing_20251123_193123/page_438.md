Previously considered a model brand spokesman, Armstrong once earned nearly $20 million in endorsement income in a single year. “Arranged marriages between brands and celebrities are inherently risky,” notes one expert. “Ninety-nine percent of celebrities do a strong job for their brand partners,” says another, “and 1 percent goes off the rails.”¹³ More than ever, it’s important to pick the right celebrity for the brand.

## Collecting Feedback

After sending the message or other brand content, the communicator must research its effect on the target audience. This involves asking target audience members whether they remember the content, how many times they saw it, what points they recall, how they felt about the content, and their past and present attitudes toward the brand and company. The communicator would also like to measure behavior resulting from the content—how many people bought the product, talked to others about it, or visited the store.

Feedback on marketing communications may suggest changes in the promotion program or in the product offer itself. For example, Macy’s uses television and newspaper advertising to inform area consumers about its stores, services, and merchandising events. Suppose feedback research shows that 80 percent of all shoppers in an area recall seeing the store’s ads and are aware of its merchandise and sales. Sixty percent of these aware shoppers have visited a Macy’s store in the past month, but only 20 percent of those who visited were satisfied with the shopping experience.

These results suggest that although promotion is creating *awareness*, Macy’s stores aren’t giving consumers the *satisfaction* they expect. Therefore, Macy’s needs to improve the shopping experience while staying with the successful communications program. In contrast, suppose research shows that only 40 percent of area consumers are aware of the store’s merchandise and events, only 30 percent of those aware have shopped recently, but 80 percent of those who have shopped return soon to shop again. In this case, Macy’s needs to strengthen its promotion program to take advantage of its power to create customer satisfaction in the store.

# Setting the Total Promotion Budget and Mix

We have looked at the steps in planning and sending communications to a target audience. But how does the company determine its total *promotion budget* and the division among the major promotional tools to create the *promotion mix*? By what process does it blend the tools to create integrated marketing communications? We now look at these questions.

## Setting the Total Promotion Budget

One of the hardest marketing decisions facing a company is how much to spend on promotion. John Wanamaker, the department store mogul, once said, “I know that half of my advertising is wasted, but I don’t know which half. I spent $2 million for advertising, and I don’t know if that is half enough or twice too much.” ● For example, Coca-Cola spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on advertising, but is that too little, just right, or too much? Thus, it is not surprising that industries and companies vary widely in how much they spend on promotion. Promotion spending may be 10–12 percent of sales for consumer packaged goods, 20 percent for cosmetics, and only 1.9 percent for household appliances. Within a given industry, both low and high spenders can be found.¹⁴

How does a company determine its promotion budget? Here, we look at four common methods used to set the total budget for advertising: the *affordable method*, the *percentage-of-sales method*, the *competitive-parity method*, and the *objective-and-task method*.

### Affordable Method

Some companies use the **affordable method**: They set the promotion budget at the level they think the company can afford. Small businesses often use this method, reasoning that Setting the promotion budget is one of the hardest decisions facing a company.
