# Acknowledgments

We greatly appreciate the valuable contributions of several people who helped make this new edition possible. As always, we owe extra-special thanks to Keri Jean Miksza for her dedicated and valuable contributions to *all* phases of the project and to her husband Pete and daughters Lucy and Mary for all the support they provide Keri during this very absorbing project.

We owe substantial thanks to Andy Norman of Drake University for his skillful help in developing chapter vignettes and highlights, company and video cases, PowerPoint presentations, and the marketing plan appendix. This and many previous editions have benefited greatly from Andy’s assistance. We also thank Colette Wolfson of the Ivy Tech Community College School of Business for her dedicated efforts in preparing end-of-chapter materials. Additional thanks go to Carol Davis at California State University Monterey Bay for her work in updating the Instructor’s Manual and Test Item File. Finally, we’d like to thank the professors who assisted with our work on MyMarketingLab: Arlene Green, Indian River State College; Mahmood Khan, Virginia Tech; Todd Korol, Monroe Community College; Susan Schanne, Eastern Michigan University; and Sarah Shepler, Ivy Tech Community College. All of these contributors are greatly appreciated in making the seventeenth edition of *Principles of Marketing* a robust teaching and learning system.

Many reviewers at other colleges and universities provided valuable comments and suggestions for this and previous editions. We are indebted to the following colleagues for their thoughtful input:
