# Whole-Channel Concept for International Marketing

This table illustrates Coca-Cola's global value delivery network, highlighting its adaptable distribution strategies across different market contexts. The network operates through channels between nations and channels within nations to reach the final user or buyer. For instance, in developed markets like the U.S., sophisticated retail channels are employed. Conversely, in less-developed countries, Coca-Cola utilizes a diverse range of methods, from push carts to delivery donkeys, demonstrating a flexible approach to international selling. This structure emphasizes the company's ability to tailor its distribution to local infrastructure and economic conditions, ensuring product availability to a global customer base.

Recent economic and technological forces have had an impact on global pricing. For example, the internet is making global price differences more obvious. When firms sell their wares over the internet, customers can see how much products sell for in different countries. They can even order a given product directly from the company location or dealer offering the lowest price. This is forcing companies toward more standardized international pricing.

## Distribution Channels

**Whole-channel view**  
Designing international channels that take into account the entire global supply chain and marketing channel, forging an effective global value delivery network.

An international company must take a **whole-channel view** of the problem of distributing products to final consumers. **Figure 19.4** shows the two major links between the seller and the final buyer. The first link, *channels between nations*, moves company products from points of production to the borders of countries within which they are sold. The second link, *channels within nations*, moves products from their market entry points to the final consumers. The whole-channel view takes into account the entire global supply chain and marketing channel. It recognizes that to compete well internationally, the company must effectively design and manage an entire *global value delivery network*.

Channels of distribution within countries vary greatly from nation to nation. There are large differences in the numbers and types of intermediaries serving each country market and in the transportation infrastructure serving these intermediaries. For example, whereas large-scale retail chains dominate the U.S. scene, most of the retailing in other countries is done by small, independent retailers. In India or Indonesia, millions of retailers operate tiny shops or sell in open markets.

When selling in emerging markets, companies must often overcome distribution infrastructure and supply challenges. For example, in Nigeria, Domino’s Pizza has had to dig wells and install water-treatment plants behind many of its restaurants to obtain clean water. Similarly, after having difficulty sourcing quality beef in South Africa, rather than buying scarce beef from scrawny cattle raised by local herdsmen, Burger King finally invested $5 million in its own local cattle ranch.⁴⁶ And to serve northeast Brazil’s Amazon River basin, which lacks a solid network of good roads, Nestlé has even launched a floating supermarket that takes goods directly to customers. The boat serves 1.5 million consumers.
