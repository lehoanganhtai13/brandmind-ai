market—sales have declined for the past 11 years in a row. Meanwhile, bottled water consumption is on a growth trajectory that shows no sign of slowing down. Currently, the average person in the United States consumes more than 36.5 gallons of bottled water every year (compared with 42 gallons for carbonated soft drinks), a 7 percent year-over-year increase and more than double the figure just 15 years ago. A $15 billion market, bottled water sales in the U.S. are expected to increase by 35 percent over the next four years. Already ahead of milk, beer, and coffee, experts predict that bottled water sales will surpass carbonated soft drink sales within the next year.

Competition is more intense now than ever as the industry consolidates and new types of bottled water emerge. The U.S. market is dominated by three global corporations. With a global portfolio of more than 50 brands (including Poland Spring, Nestlé Pure Life, Arrowhead, Deer Park, and Ice Mountain), Nestlé leads the market for “plain” bottled water. However, when all subcategories of bottled water are included (sparkling, functional water, flavored water, and so on), Coca-Cola leads the U.S. market with a 22.9 percent share. Nestlé is number two at 21.5 percent of the total bottled water market followed by PepsiCo with 16.2 percent.

While bottled water as a whole is strong, the market for the subcategory of functional waters is even stronger, growing by 12 percent for the most recent year. In the current market environment, functional waters have thrived based on the promise of incremental benefits for health-conscious consumers based on the infusion of ingredients such as vitamins, minerals (including electrolytes), herbs, and other additives. Functional waters, therefore, carry the standard benefits of taste and convenience with an increased appeal to lifestyle and well-being. Most functional waters are sweetened and flavored and are distinguished from sports drinks that have the primary purpose of maximizing hydration by replenishing electrolytes.

To break into this market, dominated by huge global corporations and littered with dozens of other small players, Chill Beverage must carefully target specific segments with features and benefits valued by those segments.

## Market Description

The bottled water market consists of many different types of water. Varieties of plain water include spring, purified, mineral, and distilled. Although these different types of water are sold as consumer products, they also serve as the core ingredient for the various types of functional waters. The flexibility of bottled water as a category seems to be endless.

Although some consumers may not perceive much of a difference between brands, others are drawn to specific product features and benefits provided by different brands. For example, some consumers may perceive spring water as healthier than other types of water. Some may look for water that is optimized for hydration. Others seek additional nutritional benefits claimed by bottlers that enhance their brands with vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other additives. Still other consumers make selections based on flavor. The industry as a whole has positioned bottled water of all kinds as a low-calorie, healthy alternative to soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, and other types of beverages.

Bottled water brands also distinguish themselves by size and type of container, multipacks, and refrigeration at point of sale. Chill Beverage’s market for NutriWater consists of consumers of single-serving-sized bottled beverages who are looking for a healthy yet flavorful alternative. *Healthy* in this context means both low-calorie and enhanced nutritional content. This market includes traditional soft drink consumers who want to improve their health as well as non–soft drink consumers who want an option other than plain bottled water. Specific segments that Chill Beverage will target during the first year include athletes, the health conscious, the socially responsible, and millennials who favor independent corporations. The Chill Soda brand has established a strong base of loyal customers, primarily among millennials. This generational segment is becoming a prime target as it matures and seeks alternatives to full-calorie soft drinks. ● **Table A1.1** shows how NutriWater addresses the needs of targeted consumer segments.
