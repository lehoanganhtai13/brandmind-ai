**February:** On the date of availability, product coolers and point-of-purchase displays will be placed in retail locations. The full brand website and social network campaign will launch with full efforts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. This campaign will drive the “Expect more” slogan as well as illustrate the ways that NutriWater delivers more than expected on product features, desirable benefits, and values by donating to Vitamin Angels and the social cause of battling vitamin deficiency in children.

**March:** To enhance the online and social marketing campaign, location-based services Foursquare and Facebook Location Services will be employed to drive traffic to retailers. Point-of-purchase displays and signage will be updated to support these efforts and to continue supporting retailers. The message of this campaign will focus on all aspects of “Expect more.”

**April:** A mobile ad campaign will provide additional support, driving traffic to the brand website and social network sites as well as driving traffic to retailers.

**May:** A trade sales contest will offer additional incentives and prizes to the distributors and retailers that sell the most NutriWater during a four-week period.

**June:** An event marketing campaign will mobilize a team of NutriWater representatives in NutriWater RVs to concerts and sports events. This will provide additional visibility for the brand as well as giving customers and potential customers the opportunity to sample products.

## Budgets

Chill Beverage has set a first-year retail sales goal of $50 million with a projected average retail price of $1.89 per unit for a total of 26,455,026 units sold. With an average wholesale price of 95 cents per unit, this provides revenues of $25.1 million. Chill Beverage expects to break even during the final quarter of the first year. A break-even analysis assumes per-unit wholesale revenue of 95 cents per unit, a variable cost per unit of 22 cents, and estimated first-year fixed costs of $12,500,000. Based on these assumptions, the break-even calculation is:

$$
\frac{12,500,000}{0.95/\text{unit} - 0.22/\text{unit}} = 17,123,287
$$

## Controls

Chill Beverage is planning tight control measures to closely monitor product quality, brand awareness, brand image, and customer satisfaction. This will enable the company to react quickly in correcting any problems that may occur. Other early warning signals that will be monitored for signs of deviation from the plan include monthly sales (by segment and channel) and monthly expenses. Given the market’s volatility, contingency plans are also in place to address fast-moving environmental changes such as shifting consumer preferences, new products, and new competition.
