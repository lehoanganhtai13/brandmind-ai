# Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

important to most buyers, especially in a tough economy. However, business buyers actually respond to both economic and personal factors. Far from being cold, calculating, and impersonal, business buyers are human and social as well. They react to both reason and emotion.

Today, most B-to-B marketers recognize that emotion plays an important role in business buying decisions. Consider this example:

> **USG Corporation** is a leading manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and other building materials for the construction and remodeling industries. Given its construction contractor, architect, and builder audience, you might expect USG’s B-to-B ads to focus heavily on performance features and benefits, such as strength, impact resistance, ease of installation, and costs. USG does promote these benefits. However, its most recent corporate marketing campaign, built around its new “It’s Your World. Build It.” positioning, packs a decidedly more emotional wallop. The campaign focuses not on how USG’s products perform but on what the company and its products stand for and mean. For example, one split-image ad shows excited children building a sand castle on one side and a worker at a construction site, hard hat in hand, on the other. The headline states: “As children we imagine great kingdoms. Build them.” As one analyst concludes, “Building materials and emotion aren’t something you would link immediately, but the [USG] campaign captures a powerful sentiment about the human need to build.”

Emotions play a role in business buying. Ads like this one from USG’s “It’s your world. Build It.” corporate marketing campaign pack a decidedly emotional wallop. USG

**Figure 6.2** lists various groups of influences on business buyers—environmental, organizational, interpersonal, and individual. Business buyers are heavily influenced by factors in the current and expected *economic environment*, such as the level of primary demand, the economic outlook, and the cost of money. Another environmental factor is the *supply* of key materials. Business buyers also are affected by *technological*, *political*, and *competitive* developments in the environment. Finally, *culture and customs* can strongly influence business buyer reactions to the marketer’s behavior and strategies, especially in the international marketing environment (see Real Marketing 6.1). The business buyer must watch these factors, determine how they will affect the buyer, and try to turn these challenges into opportunities.

**Organizational factors** are also important. Each buying organization has its own objectives, strategies, structure, systems, and procedures, and the business marketer must understand these factors well. Questions such as these arise: How many people are involved in the buying decision? Who are they? What are their evaluative criteria? What are the company’s policies and limits on its buyers?

The buying center usually includes many participants who influence each other, so *interpersonal factors* also influence the business buying process. However, it is often difficult to assess such interpersonal factors and group dynamics. Buying center participants do not wear tags that label them as “key decision maker” or “not influential.” Nor do buying center participants with the highest rank always have the most influence.

### Figure 6.2  
A Model of Business Buyer Behavior

> Like consumer buying decisions in Figure 5.2, business buying decisions are affected by an incredibly complex combination of environmental, interpersonal, and individual influences, but with an extra layer of organizational factors thrown into the mix.

This table outlines four distinct categories of factors influencing decision-making: Environmental, Organizational, Interpersonal, and Individual. The Environmental category encompasses external forces such as the economy, supply conditions, technology, politics/regulation, competition, and culture. Internally, Organizational factors include objectives, strategies, structure, systems, and procedures. Interpersonal influences are characterized by dynamics related to influence, expertise, authority, and interpersonal relationships. Finally, Individual factors represent personal attributes like age/education, job position, motives, personality, preferences, and buying style. These categories collectively illustrate a multi-layered framework where external conditions, internal structures, social interactions, and personal characteristics interact to shape outcomes.
