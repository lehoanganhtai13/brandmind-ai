Leader Price’s core value proposition is to offer French families low prices while maintaining high quality. To do so, product ranges are carefully selected so consumers don’t need to look elsewhere for better value for money. The company offers the regular array of fast-moving consumer goods but limits the number of products offered in each category. A typical Leader Price store stocks about 4,000 products, of which 3,000 are produced and branded by the company, allowing them control over quality and margins and ensuring that consumers get the best value for money. Recognizing that some consumers are loyal to certain brands, Leader Price stocks 300 of the largest (like Coke) and offers eco-friendly, organic, and fair-trade products. Only seasonal fruit, vegetables, and meat are offered to ensure the best prices, with daily delivery ensuring quality. Leader Price strives to offer a simple and pleasant shopping experience, that their store design is well-organized and inviting as well as located in urban areas near parking or public transport for easy access.

### Off-Price Retailers  
As the major discount stores traded up, a new wave of **off-price retailers** moved in to fill the ultralow-price, high-volume gap. Ordinary discounters buy at regular wholesale prices and accept lower margins to keep prices down. By contrast, off-price retailers buy at less-than-regular wholesale prices and charge consumers less than retail. Off-price retailers can be found in all areas, from food, clothing, and electronics to no-frills banking and discount brokerages.

The three main types of off-price retailers are *independents*, *factory outlets*, and *warehouse clubs*. Independent off-price retailers either are independently owned and run or are divisions of larger retail corporations. Although many off-price operations are run by smaller independents, most large off-price retailer operations are owned by bigger retail chains. Examples include store retailers such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, all owned by TJX Companies, and online sellers such as Overstock.com. TJ Maxx promises brand name and designer fashions for 20 to 60 percent off department store prices. How does it fulfill this promise? Its buyers are constantly on the lookout for deals. “So when a designer overproduces and department stores overbuy,” says the company, “we swoop in, negotiate the lowest possible price, and pass the savings on.”[^9]

**Factory outlets** — manufacturer-owned and operated stores by firms such as J.Crew, Gap, Levi Strauss, and others — sometimes group together in *factory outlet malls* and *value-retail centers*. At these centers, dozens of outlet stores offer prices as much as 50 percent below retail on a wide range of mostly surplus, discounted, or irregular goods. Whereas outlet malls consist primarily of manufacturers’ outlets, value-retail centers combine manufacturers’ outlets with off-price retail stores and department store clearance outlets.

These malls in general are now moving upscale — and even dropping *factory* from their descriptions. A growing number of outlet malls now feature luxury brands such as Coach, Polo Ralph Lauren, Dolce & Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, and Versace. As consumers become more value-minded, even upper-end retailers are accelerating their factory outlet strategies, placing more emphasis on outlets such as Nordstrom Rack, Neiman Marcus Last Call, Bloomingdale’s Outlets, and Saks Off 5th. Many companies now regard outlets not simply as a way of disposing of problem merchandise but as an additional way of gaining business for fresh merchandise. For example, 90 percent of the merchandise sold in Neiman Marcus’s Last Call outlets is made specifically for those stores.[^10] The combination of highbrow brands and lowbrow prices found at outlets provides powerful shopper appeal, especially in thriftier times.

**Warehouse clubs** (also known as *wholesale clubs* or *membership warehouses*), such as Costco, Sam’s Club, and BJ’s, operate in huge, warehouse-like facilities and offer few frills.
