“This is just a general celebration of people who love to wear Chuck Taylors,” says Converse’s VP of global marketing.

“Made By You” also uses real exhibitions designed to both showcase fans’ creations and encourage them to share their Chuck experiences. For example, Converse took over window and store displays in retail locations of partners such as Foot Locker, Nordstrom, and Journeys. Some locations provided portable portrait studios that let people become part of the campaign on the spot. And at a Converse location in New York’s Flatiron district and through a mobile app, a “Made By You” virtual reality experience let consumers walk in the shoes of artist Ron English, actress Joanna DeLane, musician King Tuff, and urban explorer Thomas Midlane.

The “Made By You” campaign is part and parcel of Converse’s philosophy of letting consumers define the brand and share brand experiences. Converse sums up “Made By You” this way: “We made them to sink jump shots on the court. You, however, saw them as something more . . . and started wearing our sneakers to do whatever you wanted. You played music, made art, skated the streets, and kicked back. You wore them as fashion. You wore them to work. You customized them with your personal style. You did everything to them, and in them. To this day, this spirit continues. As soon as you put them on and start doing your thing, their true life begins. You define them. You determine their journey. They become a one-of-a-kind celebration of your individuality and self-expression. They become a part of you. They’re Made By You.”

big companies have learned, ads and other content made by amateurs can be . . . well, pretty amateurish. If done well, however, consumer-generated content efforts can produce new creative ideas and fresh perspectives on the brand from consumers who actually experience it. Such campaigns can boost consumer engagement and get customers talking and thinking about a brand and its value to them.

## Selecting Advertising Media

**Advertising media**  
The vehicles through which advertising messages are delivered to their intended audiences.

The major steps in **advertising media** selection are (1) determining *reach, frequency, impact,* and *engagement*; (2) choosing among major *media types*; (3) selecting specific *media vehicles*; and (4) choosing *media timing*.

### Determining Reach, Frequency, Impact, and Engagement.

To select media, the advertiser must determine the reach and frequency needed to achieve the advertising objectives. *Reach* is a measure of the *percentage* of people in the target market who are exposed to an ad campaign during a given period of time. For example, the advertiser might try to reach 70 percent of the target market during the first three months of a campaign. *Frequency* is a measure of how many *times* the average person in the target market is exposed to a message. For example, the advertiser might want an average exposure frequency of three.

But advertisers want to do more than just reach a given number of consumers a specific number of times. The advertiser also must determine the desired *media impact*—the *qualitative value* of message exposure through a given medium. For example, the same message in one magazine (say, *Time*) may be more believable than in another (say, the *National Enquirer*). For products that need to be demonstrated, television ads or online videos may have more impact than radio messages because they use sight, motion, *and* sound. Products for which consumers provide input on design or features might be better promoted at an interactive website or social media page than in a direct mailing.

More generally, an advertiser wants to choose media that will *engage* consumers rather than simply reach them. Using any medium, the relevance of ad content for its audience is often much more important than how many people it reaches. ● For example, when Mazda wanted to preannounce the sale of 100 25th-anniversary models of its iconic Mazda MX-5 Miata car at the New York International Auto show, it didn’t use big-budget, high-reach media. Instead, it began Engaging the right consumers with the right media worked well for Mazda.
