Emirates also unveiled its newest version of ICE, which includes the largest in-seat screens in the industry for first and economy class.

Emirates’ promotional strategies effectively communicate its brand image as the best airline in the world. Between 2015 and 2016, Emirates released two highly anticipated television commercials for A380 featuring Hollywood celebrity Jennifer Aniston that quickly went viral. Emirates also continued to sponsor many sporting events, including football, cricket, rugby, golf, and the U.S. Open championship. The airline invigorated fans’ love of football through its “benfica safety video,” which created tremendous buzz on social media. The video showed a group of Emirates’ female cabin crew smartly dressed in their uniforms enter the football field and give match and safety information with a twist—the physical movements and actions were like the safety instructions given on an Emirates flight.

Emirates has one of the most active and engaged social communities, with a combined following of 11 million across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Google+. Emirates was the first airline to have 1 million followers and is becoming the largest transportation brand on the popular social media platforms.

Although the majority of the world’s big airlines are members of one of the top three alliances, namely Star Alliance, Oneworld or SkyTeam, Emirates has not joined any of them. However, Emirates has developed bilateral and codeshare agreements with many other airlines to gain access to foreign markets. Such partnerships allow its customers to plan a seamless travel experience—they can book their whole journey with Emirates and connect to destinations in other countries via other airlines with one ticket. Emirates’ partnership with Qantas has been hugely successful and set the standard for many such partnerships. Emirates now has more than 20 such partnerships, including ones with Air Malta, Air Mauritius, EasyJet, Jet Airways, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Oman Air, Thai Air, and Virgin Airline America.

Emirates’ dominance in international air travel continues to grow, with the airline rounding off another year of growth in 2016, supported by its fleet and network expansion as well as customer-focused product investments and enhancements.

Some companies successfully pursue more than one value discipline at the same time. For example, FedEx excels at both operational excellence and customer intimacy. However, such companies are rare; few firms can be the best at more than one of these disciplines. By trying to be *good at all* value disciplines, a company usually ends up being *best at none.*

Thus, most excellent companies focus on and excel at a single value discipline while meeting industry standards on the other two. Such companies design their entire value delivery network to single-mindedly support the chosen discipline. For example, Walmart knows that customer intimacy and product leadership are important. Compared with other discounters, it offers good customer service and an excellent product assortment. Still, it purposely offers less customer service and less product depth than does Nordstrom or Williams-Sonoma, which pursue customer intimacy. Instead, Walmart focuses obsessively on operational excellence—on reducing costs and streamlining its order-to-delivery process to make it convenient for customers to buy just the right products at the lowest prices.

By the same token, Equinox Fitness Clubs wants to be efficient and employ the latest operations technologies. But what really sets the luxury gym apart is its customer intimacy. Equinox coddles its customers with an app to sign up for classes ahead of time, refrigerated eucalyptus towels, and Kiehl’s products in the locker rooms. In addition, each location has a spa and snack bar filled with organic selections. “Epic workouts demand unexpected luxuries. Exclusive Kiehl’s products. Eco-chic amenities. Spaces that inspire and ignite,” says Equinox. “Equinox isn’t just a fitness club, it’s a temple of well-being. It’s not fitness. It’s life.”

Classifying competitive strategies as value disciplines is appealing. It defines marketing strategy in terms of the single-minded pursuit of delivering superior value to customers. Each value discipline defines a specific way to build lasting customer relationships.

## Competitive Positions

Firms competing in a given target market at any point in time differ in their objectives and resources. Some firms are large; others are small. Some have many resources; others are strapped for funds. Some are mature and established; others new and fresh. Some strive for rapid market share growth; others for long-term profits.
