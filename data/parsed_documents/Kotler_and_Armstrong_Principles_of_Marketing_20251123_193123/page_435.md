Examples are messages showing a product’s quality, economy, value, or performance. Thus, an ad for Aleve makes this matter-of-fact claim:  
“More pills doesn’t mean more pain relief. Aleve has the strength to keep back, body, and arthritis pain away all day with fewer pills than Tylenol.” And a Weight Watchers’ ad states this simple fact: “The diet secret to end all diet secrets is that there is no diet secret.”

*Emotional appeals* attempt to stir up either negative or positive emotions that can motivate purchase. Communicators may use emotional appeals ranging from love, joy, and humor to fear and guilt. Advocates of emotional messages claim that they attract more attention and create more belief in the sponsor and the brand. The idea is that consumers often feel before they think, and persuasion is emotional in nature.

Good storytelling in a commercial often strikes an emotional chord. For example, rather than focusing only on the nuts and bolts and mileage information found in many car ads, an Audi Super Bowl 50 ad, called “The Commander,” played to consumer’s emotions:  

> “The Commander” draws on nostalgia, sentiment, and father-and-son relationships. It opens with depressed former astronaut whose life has seemingly passed him by. His son drops in to check on him, then takes him outside and offers him the keys to his Audi R8 V10 Plus—Audi’s highest-performing car—which can reach speeds of 205 miles per hour. As he drives the Audi, the father is transported back to the best moments of his life, launching once again into the unknown, all to the soundtrack of David Bowie’s “Starman.” The commercial effectively tugged at the human spirit while reinforcing  the Audi’s extreme performance credentials. According to one journalist, the commercial created “the melancholy that comes from watching a man whose best days in life have already passed by, and a resolution in watching him be his younger, courageous self.” By pinging viewer emotions, “The Commander” placed in the top 10 on the *USA Today* Ad Meter and received more than 8 million views on YouTube in less than one month.

*Moral appeals* are directed to an audience’s sense of what is “right” and “proper.” They are often used to urge people to support social causes, such as a cleaner environment or aid to the disadvantaged. For example, a Colgate ad campaign urges people to “Close the tap while brushing” their teeth to conserve water. One ad shows a young boy in a developing economy with a water bucket atop his head, noting, “What you waste in two minutes is all his family needs for a day.”

**Message Structure.** Marketers must also decide how to handle three message structure issues. The first is whether to draw a conclusion or leave it to the audience. Research suggests that, in many cases, rather than drawing a conclusion, the advertiser is better off asking questions and letting buyers come to their own conclusions.

The second message structure issue is whether to present the strongest arguments first or last. Presenting them first gets strong attention but may lead to an anticlimactic ending.

The third message structure issue is whether to present a one-sided argument (mentioning only the product’s strengths) or a two-sided argument (touting the product’s strengths while also admitting its shortcomings). Usually, a one-sided argument is more effective in sales presentations—except when audiences are highly educated or likely to hear opposing claims or when the communicator has a negative association to overcome. In this spirit, Heinz once ran the message “Heinz Ketchup is slow good,” and Listerine ran the message “Listerine tastes bad twice a day.” In such cases, two-sided messages can enhance an advertiser’s credibility and make buyers more resistant to competitor attacks.

**Message Format.** The marketing communicator also needs a strong *format* for the message. In a print ad, the communicator has to decide on the headline, copy, illustration, and colors. To attract attention, advertisers can use novelty and contrast; eye-catching pictures and headlines; distinctive formats; message size and position; and color, shape, and movement. For example, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup ads are bold and simple. They feature the brand’s familiar orange, yellow, and brown colors with text overlaying images of the classic candy.  
They feature clever headlines that unite the candy’s two distinctive CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER WALK INTO A BAR.
