# Chapter 6 | Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

The blog includes original content from various GE sources, including GE Garages—an initiative designed to reinvigorate innovation and manufacturing by providing a collaborative space where technologists, entrepreneurs, and everyday Americans can engage in hands-on experiences with 3D printers, computer-controlled milling machines, laser cutters, and injection molders. As with GE’s other digital content, GE Reports offers easily digestible material that gets people excited about the future of technology and science while positioning GE as a company that is leading them into that future.

GE has also mastered the art of digital video content. An example is the company’s recent award-winning “Childlike Imagination” campaign, a series of video ads that show the scope of GE’s product lines through the eyes of a little girl whose Mom works at GE. The magical videos bring GE’s industrial products—from jet engines, diesel locomotives, and giant wind turbines to hospital diagnostics machines—to life through the eyes of an amazed young girl whose mom works at GE. “My mom? She makes underwater fans that are powered by the moon,” declares the girl. “My mom makes airplane engines that can talk.” Although these videos can be shown as ads on traditional broadcast TV, they drive substantial online traffic through GE’s social media channels.

Thus, in its digital efforts, GE acts less like an advertiser and more like a brand content publisher—creating, curating, and shaping brand content and conversations in real time. “For a brand that has the history that we do, staying modern, contemporary, and relevant is something we think about every single day,” says GE’s CMO. “We think about who shares our passion and our interest in science, technology, and engineering and we go after that. We do that on platforms as diverse as Instagram, Vine, Snapchat, Yo, and many others.” In all, few companies do digital better than GE. “When it comes to innovative social media campaigns,” says one analyst, GE is “often light-years ahead of most marketers,” regardless of industry.

Many institutional markets are characterized by low budgets and captive patrons. For example, hospital patients have little choice but to eat whatever food the hospital supplies. A hospital purchasing agent has to decide on the quality of food to buy for patients. Because the food is provided as a part of a total service package, the buying objective is not profit. Nor is strict cost minimization the goal—patients receiving poor-quality food will complain to others and damage the hospital’s reputation. Thus, the hospital purchasing agent must search for institutional food vendors whose quality meets or exceeds a certain minimum standard and whose prices are low.

Many marketers set up separate divisions to meet the special characteristics and needs of institutional buyers. ● For example General Mills Convenience and Foodservice unit produces, packages, prices, and markets its broad assortment of cereals, cookies, snacks, and other products to better serve the specific food service requirements of hospitals, schools, hotels, and other institutional markets in addition to traditional B-to-B businesses such as convenience stores.

## Government Markets

**government market**  
Governmental units—federal, state, and local—that purchase or rent goods and services for carrying out the main functions of government.

The **government market** offers large opportunities for many companies, both big and small. In most countries, government organizations are major buyers of goods and services. In the United States alone, federal, state, and local governments contain more than 89,000 buying units that purchase more than $3 trillion in goods and services each year. Government buying and business buying are similar in many ways. But there are also differences that must be understood by companies that wish to sell products and services to governments. To succeed in the government market, sellers must locate key decision makers, identify the factors that affect buyer behavior, and understand the buying decision process.
