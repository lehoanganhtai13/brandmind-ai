**13-10** If Selfycart or a similar mobile checkout app was available at your grocery store, would you use it? What benefits would you gain by using this new technology? Discuss the challenges you would face. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  

# Marketing Ethics Footloose and Tax Free  
In the United Kingdom, in the summer of 2013, there were mass protests against several global brands operating in the country. Starbucks, Google, Amazon, and Vodafone immediately came under fire. Shortly afterward, the Arcadia Group, Boots, and Fortnum & Mason were singled out for attention. The reason: they were all avoiding paying UK taxes on UK sales. Everything they were doing was legal; however, it was tax avoidance, not tax evasion. Starbucks, despite sales of almost $500 million, had paid no corporation tax. It was instead paying royalties to a Dutch sister company, buying coffee beans in Switzerland, and paying extortionate interest on loans to other parts of the business. Meanwhile, Amazon, enjoying sales of $5.5 billion, had somehow contrived to pay less than $3 million in tax. Similarly, Google, with a turnover of $640 million, had paid under $10 million in tax. How is this legally achieved? The first tried-and-tested method is to locate facilities in low-tax jurisdictions, as when Starbucks located its coffee wholesaling business in Switzerland. Google’s UK operation is actually based in the Republic of Ireland and Bermuda. The second method is known as transfer pricing. By locating factories, services, and distribution in low-tax countries, the business is able to bill the subsidiary in a high-tax country. In effect, the money is siphoned out of the high-tax country into a low-tax one.  
**13-11** Why do global businesses use such strategies? Are the financial benefits greater than the loss in customer confidence and trust? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  
**13-12** Consider the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, which would enable state governments in the United States to collect sales taxes from online retailers. Discuss the impact this act will have on small retailers. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)  

# Marketing by the Numbers Inventory Management  
Stock turnover is a way to measure stock performance. It is an indication of the number of times the stock has been replaced over a given period of time. This is a measurement of sales performance too, as the higher the rate, the better the stock, and the business, is performing. If the rate is low, then the stock is taking some time to sell; as the business has cash tied up in the stock, its cash flow is affected. In order to work out stock turnover, it is necessary to calculate the value of the opening stock and the value of the closing stock over a period of time.  
**13-13** Refer to Appendix 2, “Marketing by the Numbers,” and determine the average stock of a business with an opening stock of $24,000 and a closing stock of $36,000. (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Thinking)  
**13-14** If a company has sold goods worth $210,000, what is the stock turnover ratio? Is this a good or bad ratio in your opinion? (Objective 3) (AACSB: Written and Oral Communication; Reflective Thinking)  

# Video Case Kmart  
Once the leader in discount retailing, Kmart long ago took a back seat to Walmart, Target, and others discount chains. But recent efforts to provide value to customers through innovation show that the veteran retailer may still have its edge. To gain a competitive one-up, Kmart started a unique program that combined the benefits of online and brick-and-mortar shopping. When an item that customers wanted to purchase was not in stock at one of its stores, Kmart would ship the item to the customer’s home for free.  
To launch this program, Kmart unveiled an ad campaign that illustrated an uncharacteristic relevance to younger, tech-savvy customers. With the slight-of-mouth message that customers could “ship their pants” (or any of the other 65 million items in Kmart’s inventory) for free, the ad went viral. As a result, Kmart got its message out in spades, entertaining many while offending a few along the way.  
After viewing the video featuring Kmart, answer the following questions:  
**13-15** Consider the retail marketing mix. How did Kmart differentiate itself from other retailers with its free shipping program?  
**13-16** What kind of customer does the “Ship My Pants” campaign target? How is this significant?  
**13-17** Discuss what will be the ultimate effects of this Kmart campaign.
