# The Outlook for MSC

They plan to generate most of their increased market share with an increased focus on the popular Caribbean voyages sector.

However, one of the biggest challenges they face is getting their pricing right, against competitors from other cruise lines and from an array of traditional holiday solutions, such as resorts, theme parks, and tour operators. In addition, in today’s Internet-based world, consumers are better informed and are looking for new experiences and, of course, great value.

Passengers are usually prompted to opt for a drinks package that is levied at a daily rate. This does not include premium alcohol, which is usually a further charge.

Moreover, on most cruise lines, including MSC Cruises, passengers are told not to tip the staff. Instead, there is a daily charge levied on each passenger that is then allocated to all staff members. Additional costs are also levied on passengers for excursions and tours, Internet usage, shop purchases, casino gaming, video games, spa treatments, and so on.

Therefore, as you can probably guess, passengers who take on a beverage package, go on tours, use the Internet, and make purchases will have a substantial bill to cover at the end of their cruise. But this situation would not be significantly different if the consumer was staying at a resort. However, some first-time customers may be concerned by this approach to pricing, particularly if they had thought that virtually everything had been paid for at the start of the cruise.

# Questions for Discussion

**10-18** Outline the competitive advantages of a cruise versus a traditional flight-resort holiday package. Which holiday choice would you prefer? Which one would you be willing to pay a premium price for?

**10-19** The ease of comparison on the Internet tends to encourage price-based consumer decisions. What could MSC Cruises do to help take the consumer’s focus off price to some extent and consider other attributes?

**10-20** Which of the three pricing strategies discussed would work best for MSC Cruises, given their overall market share growth goals? Why?

**10-21** Review MSC’s pricing approach of providing a relatively low up-front price but then relying on additional sales for profitability. Outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

**10-22** Do you agree with MSC’s overall approach to pricing? What recommendations would you have for them, particularly as they have a similar pricing structure to the market leaders?
