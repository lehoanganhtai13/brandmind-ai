For example, e-commerce is Grainger’s fastest-growing sales channel, making Grainger the 13th-largest online seller in the United States and Canada. Online and mobile purchasing now account for 40 percent of the wholesaler’s total sales.³⁷

## Trends in Wholesaling

Today’s wholesalers face considerable challenges. The industry remains vulnerable to one of its most enduring trends—the need for ever-greater efficiency. Tight economic conditions have led to demands for even lower prices and the winnowing out of suppliers who are not adding value based on cost and quality. Progressive wholesalers constantly watch for better ways to meet the changing needs of their suppliers and target customers. They recognize that their only reason for existence comes from adding value, which occurs by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire marketing channel.

As with other types of marketers, the goal is to build value-adding customer relationships. For example, consider Sysco, the $49 billion wholesale food distribution company that operates behind the scenes to supply more than 425,000 restaurants, schools, hospitals, colleges, and other commercial customers that prepare meals away from home.³⁸

Giant food distribution wholesaler Sysco lives up to its “Good things come from Sysco” motto by procuring and delivering food and food service supplies more dependably, efficiently, and cheaply than customers could ever hope to do on their own. Sysco Corporation

- Whether it’s a hot dog from Reliant Stadium in Houston, the original Italian sub from Jersey Mike’s, crab cakes from a Hilton Hotel, or a ham and cheese sandwich at the local hospital cafeteria, the chances are good that the ingredients were supplied by Sysco, the nation’s top food supplier. Sysco supplies anything and everything needed to run an eating establishment, from boxes of seafood, chicken, and beef to 25-pound bags of rice or pasta to gallon jars of ketchup or salsa to boxes of plastic gloves and jugs of dishwashing detergent. What makes Sysco so valuable to its customers is that it procures and delivers these supplies more dependably, efficiently, and cheaply than customers could ever hope to do on their own.

For example, Lowell’s, the iconic restaurant in Seattle’s Pike Place Market, procures almost all of its products conveniently through the Sysco Market online ordering system. Its orders are processed quickly and accurately at Sysco’s automated distribution center. Then, Lowell’s—by itself or with the help of Sysco sales associates and dispatchers—can track the location of individual deliveries via the My Sysco Truck program. Sysco constantly seeks new ways to add more value and build trust, from product traceability for safety to sourcing products from local, small- to mid-sized farms, ranches, and processors to serve the needs of customers whose businesses are positioned on sustainability and community. In short, Sysco more than lives up to its motto: “Good things come from Sysco.”

The distinction between large retailers and large wholesalers continues to blur. Many retailers now operate formats such as wholesale clubs and supercenters that perform many wholesale functions. In return, some large wholesalers are setting up their own retailing operations. For example, SuperValu is the nation’s largest food wholesaler, and it’s also one of the country’s largest food retailers. About half of the company’s sales come from its Cub Foods, Save-A-Lot, Farm Fresh, Hornbacher’s, Shop ’n Save, and Shoppers stores.³⁹

Wholesalers will continue to increase the services they provide to retailers—retail pricing, cooperative advertising, marketing and management information services, accounting services, online transactions, and others. However, both the more value-focused environment and the demand for increased services have put the squeeze on wholesaler profits. Wholesalers that do not find efficient ways to deliver value to their customers will soon drop by the wayside. Fortunately, the increased use of computerized, automated, and internet-based systems will help wholesalers contain the costs of ordering, shipping, and inventory holding, thus boosting their productivity.
