# Deciding on the Global Marketing Program

Companies that operate in one or more foreign markets must decide how much, if at all, to adapt their marketing strategies and programs to local conditions. At one extreme are global companies that use **standardized global marketing**, essentially using the same marketing strategy approaches and marketing mix worldwide. At the other extreme is **adapted global marketing**. In this case, the producer adjusts the marketing strategy and mix elements to each target market, resulting in more costs but hopefully producing a larger market share and return.

The question of whether to adapt or standardize the marketing strategy and program has been much debated over the years. On the one hand, some global marketers believe that technology is making the world a smaller place, and consumer needs around the world are becoming more similar. This paves the way for global brands and standardized global marketing. Global branding and standardization, in turn, result in greater brand power and reduced costs from economies of scale.

On the other hand, the marketing concept holds that marketing programs will be more engaging if tailored to the unique needs of each targeted customer group. If this concept applies within a country, it should apply even more across international markets. Despite global convergence, consumers in different countries still have widely varied cultural backgrounds. They still differ significantly in their needs and wants, spending power, product preferences, and shopping patterns. Because these differences are hard to change, most marketers today adapt their products, prices, channels, and promotions to fit consumer desires in each country.

However, global standardization is not an all-or-nothing proposition. It’s a matter of degree. Most international marketers suggest that companies should “think globally but act locally.” They should seek a balance between standardization and adaptation, leveraging global brand recognition but adapting their marketing, products, and operations to specific markets.

> Consider L’Oréal, the world’s biggest cosmetics maker. L’Oréal and its brands are truly global in scope and appeal. The company’s well-known brands originated in a half-dozen or more different cultures, including French (L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Lancôme), American (Maybelline, Kiehl’s, SoftSheen-Carson, Ralph Lauren, Urban Decay, Clarisonic, Redken), British (The Body Shop), Italian (Giorgio Armani), and Japanese (Shu Uemura). But the company’s outstanding international success comes from achieving a global–local balance, one that adapts and differentiates L’Oréal’s well-known brands to meet local needs while also integrating them across world markets to optimize their global impact.  

> L’Oréal digs deep to understand what beauty means to consumers in different parts of the world, with research insights gained through everything from in-home visits to observations made in “bathroom laboratories” equipped with high-tech gadgetry. How many minutes does a Chinese woman devote to her morning beauty routine? How do people wash their hair in Bangkok? How many brush strokes does a Japanese woman or a French woman use to apply mascara? L’Oréal then uses such detailed insights to create products and positioning for brands in local markets. For example, more than 260 scientists work in L’Oréal’s Shanghai research center, tailoring products ranging from lipstick to herbal cleaners to cucumber toners for Chinese tastes.

> L’Oréal also adapts brand positioning and marketing to international needs and expectations. For example, more than 20 years ago, the company bought stodgy American makeup producer Maybelline. To reinvigorate and globalize the brand, it moved the unit’s headquarters from Tennessee to New York City and added “New York” to the label. The resulting urban, street-smart, Big Apple image played well with the midprice positioning of the workaday makeup brand globally. The makeover soon earned Maybelline a 20 percent market share in its category in Western Europe. The young urban positioning also hit the mark in Asia, where few women realized that the trendy “New York” Maybelline brand belonged to a French cosmetics giant. L’Oréal’s CEO sums up the company’s global approach this way: “We have global brands, but we need to adapt them to local needs.” When a former CEO once addressed a UNESCO conference, nobody batted an eyelid when he described L’Oréal as “The United Nations of Beauty.”

> **Author Comment to this:** The major global marketing decision usually boils down to this: How much, if at all, should a company adapt its marketing strategy and programs to local markets? How might the answer differ for Boeing versus McDonald’s?
