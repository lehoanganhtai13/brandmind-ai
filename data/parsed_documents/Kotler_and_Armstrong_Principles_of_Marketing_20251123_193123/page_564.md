# Video Case Umpqua Bank

The retail banking industry has become very competitive. And with a few powerhouses that dominate the market, how is a small bank to thrive? By differentiating itself through a competitive advantage that the big guys can’t touch.

That’s exactly what Umpqua has done. One step inside a branch of this Oregon-based community bank and it is immediately apparent that this is not your typical Christmas club savings account/free toaster bank. Umpqua has created a business model that has transformed banking from retail drudgery to a holistic experience. Umpqua has created an environment where people just love to hang out. It not only has its own music download service featuring local artists, it even has its own blend of coffee.

But under all these bells and whistles lies the core of what makes Umpqua so different: a rigorous service culture where every branch and each employee gets measured on how well they serve customers. That’s why every customer feels like he or she gets the help and attention needed from employees.

After viewing the video featuring Umpqua Bank, answer the following questions about creating competitive advantage:

- **18-15** With what companies does Umpqua compete?  
- **18-16** What is Umpqua’s competitive advantage?  
- **18-17** Do you think that Umpqua will be able to maintain this advantage in the long run? Why or why not?

# Company Case YouTube: Google’s Quest for Video Dominance

There’s no doubt about it. Google—now part of holding company Alphabet—is an unquestioned success. With annual revenues of $71.5 billion last year, only 35 U.S. companies were bigger—and Google is younger than every one of them. But even its rapid rise in revenues doesn’t capture the power and influence of this brash, young company. After all, Google powers a whopping 70 percent of all desktop internet searches, a statistic that balloons to 95 percent on mobile devices.

But when it comes to defining its competition, the picture isn’t cut so clear for the undisputed sultan of search. Certainly, Microsoft (Bing) and Yahoo! are in Google’s crosshairs when it comes to search. But when it comes to keeping an eye on competitors, Google is likely more concerned about Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Samsung. In fact, not one of these companies makes a move that Google doesn’t notice and evaluate.

How do such seemingly diverse companies end up competing so fiercely with one another? It turns out that these companies really aren’t so different when it comes to their ultimate goal—to meet the digital needs of consumers everywhere, a need set that is rapidly evolving and tricky to define. But as consumers have turned more and more of their time and attention to the connected devices they hold in their hands, Google has realized that capturing the biggest possible share of “time spent” in the digital space is what it really seeks. And although Google and competitors Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Samsung each started out focusing on specific product categories, the quest for online dominance has blurred those market borders and placed the companies in direct competition with each other.

Consider Google’s portfolio of internet-oriented products—Gmail, Chrome, Google Maps, Google Earth, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Photos. Throw in Android, Google Wallet, Chromebooks, and Google+ and suddenly Google and its competitors lock horns in more ways than one. Expand even further to the “moonshot” projects that fall under Google parent Alphabet’s umbrella—the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, robots, alternative energy production, and autonomous vehicles—and Google and its competitors become so intertwined that it’s hard to tease things apart.

Google knows that to be as competitive as possible, it isn’t enough to diversify into various businesses and product lines. Rather than being disjointed pieces, every piece must fit neatly into a holistic pie. For Google, all those projects may center around internet search and organizing the world’s information. But ultimately, Google wants a big piece of consumers’ digital world. And perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in Google’s efforts to be the leading source of streaming video programming, with its YouTube unit at the heart of those efforts.

## “I Want My TV!”

When it comes to how people carve up their days, working and sleeping occupy the most ticks of the clock. But according to one recent study, leisure activities take a strong third place. Americans average 5.3 hours each day of leisure time, including activities such as socializing, playing games, reading, recreation and exercise, and relaxing. But a whopping half of all leisure time is spent watching TV. Nowadays, that includes any and all video programming on any and all devices. And although traditional television is still king, the average person now consumes 70 minutes of online video each day, a number that is growing rapidly. Most of that viewing time is spent on mobile devices over traditional computers. In fact, video will account for 80 percent of all mobile traffic within the next few years.
