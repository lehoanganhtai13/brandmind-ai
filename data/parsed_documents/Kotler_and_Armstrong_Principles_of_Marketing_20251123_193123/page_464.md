# 15.2 Converse: Letting Customers Co-author the Brand Story

The story began in 1923 when Converse introduced the first pair of Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoes—known around the world as Cons, Connies, Convics, Verses, or just plain Chucks. Throughout the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s, Chucks were the shoes to have. The first Olympic basketball team wore them, and they dominated basketball courts—amateur and professional—for more than 50 years. By the mid-1970s, 70 to 80 percent of basketball players still wore Converse.

However, the Converse brand story almost came to an end little more than a decade ago. As the sneaker market exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, Converse failed to keep up with the times. Aggressive new competitors like Nike, Adidas, and Reebok took the market by storm with new high-performance shoes and even higher-performing marketing schemes. By 2001, Converse’s market share had dwindled to only 1 percent and the once-dominant brand declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The Converse story would likely have ended right there if not for the foresight of an unlikely suitor. Following the bankruptcy, market leader Nike stepped in and quietly bought Converse on the cheap. Nike still saw promise in the venerable-though-depleted old brand. But Nike faced a perplexing question: How does a mega-marketer like Nike bring a fading icon like Converse back to life? The answer: Let customers do it. Rather than following the Nike model of using high-powered marketing to shape the brand’s image and positioning, Converse invited customers themselves to help co-create the Converse brand and co-author a new Converse story.

That’s something that Converse customers had long had been doing anyway. Converse discovered that, despite its dwindling market share, the brand had acquired a small but fiercely loyal following. And despite the fact that Converse had never promoted the brand as anything but basketball shoes, avid brand fans were defining Converse in an entirely different way. During the 1990s, street kids had begun wearing affordable Converse shoes as an expression of individuality. Soon to follow were emerging artists, designers, and musicians who wore Chucks because of their simplicity and classic looks. Converse became a favorite of the anti-establishment, anti-corporate crowd, those tired of trendy fashions. Individualistic Converse fans would take a pair of cheap but comfy All Stars, trash them, scribble on them, and customize them as a canvas for personal expression.

Converse recognized that today’s young consumers don’t want a brand that’s neatly defined, packaged, and handed to them; they want to experience a brand, help shape it, and share it with other like-minded people. So rather than forcing a new brand story onto the market, Converse decided to turn the brand over to consumers themselves and let them write the next chapter. At the heart of the rekindled Converse brand is the philosophy that, these days, customers control brands, not companies. In the eyes of consumers, Converse today is less about the shoes and more about self-expression. Converse sees its role simply as making great products that customers want to wear. Beyond that, it participates in the brand story rather than dictating it.

Thus, today’s Converse is built less on big-budget marketing campaigns and more on consumer-generated content by which customers express themselves and share their brand experiences. Converse has fully embraced social media, an ideal forum for engaging young consumers and letting them share content that helps to define the brand. Converse now spends more than 90 percent of its marketing dollars on digital media. Consider this: Converse has become the most popular sneaker brand on Facebook, with more than 37 million Facebook fans, 50 percent more than parent company and market leader Nike. Converse also has more than a million Twitter followers and 3.6 million followers on Instagram. That’s amazing social sharing for a niche brand that still captures only 3 percent of the U.S. market.

The latest example of how Converse inspires consumer-generated content is its recently launched “Made By You” campaign. The campaign celebrates individuality and self-expression by inviting people to share photos of their uniquely customized Converse All Stars along with backstories on their Converse experiences. “Made By You” was inspired by the reality that consumers by the thousands are already sharing pictures, videos, and other content of themselves in their Chucks via social media. “It’s an idea that is already sort of happening,” says a Converse marketer. “People are taking pics of their Chucks on the weekend, vacation, whatever it may be. We see 13,000 to 15,000 [Converse] tags a day.”

The “Made By You” campaign helps inspire and organize the consumer-generated content process. It assembles photos of customized Converse sneakers submitted by fans from around the world and makes them available in a curated online collection, all presented and signed by the people who created them. The collection includes photos from notable celebrities such as Patti Smith and Andy Warhol. But the bulk of the creative images come
