# Critical Thinking Exercises

Many companies employ procurement or purchasing experts dedicated to managing the firm’s buying process. Visit www.glassdoor.com/salaries and www.indeed.com/salary to conduct a search of the salary ranges for “procurement specialists” and similar positions in purchasing. Present your findings. Can e-procurement help to streamline the buying process? Might it eventually replace employees in these careers? Discuss if it is possible for all buying functions to be performed through e-procurement. (AACSB: Communication, Reflective Thinking, Use of IT)

**6-7** Interview a businessperson to learn how purchases are made in his or her organization. Ask this person to describe a straight rebuy, a modified rebuy, and a new-task buying situation that took place recently or of which he or she is aware (define them if necessary). Did the buying process differ based on the type of product or purchase situation? Ask the businessperson to explain the role he or she played in a recent purchase and to discuss the factors that influenced the decision. Write a brief report of your interview by applying the concepts you learned in this chapter regarding business buyer behavior. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

**6-8** At various times, many governments have favored a procurement process that requires government buyers to choose domestic rather than foreign suppliers. This approach has also been used by some retailers as integral parts of their advertising, encouraging consumers to buy domestic rather than overseas brands. Investigate the government procurement policy in your own country and try to find a retailer that has run an advertising campaign like this. How were these policies and campaigns received? What was their longevity? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### E-procurement and Mobile Procurement

Gone are the days of tedious, paper-laden, and labor-intensive procurement duties. E-procurement is changing the way buyers and sellers do business, specifically via mobile procurement that offers cloud-based platforms that reduce the search, order, and approval cycle. Most large companies have adopted some form of e-procurement. A recent study found that almost 70 percent of companies utilize some form of e-procurement, mobile procurement, or supply chain management applications. A leading industry platform, Coupa, provides a suite of cloud-based applications for finance, including accounts payable, sourcing, procurement, and expense management that allows customers full functionality from their mobile devices. Employees now enjoy the flexibility and time savings of viewing, approving, or denying requisitions, purchase orders, and invoices. One of Coupa’s large retail clients claimed a reduction from 10 days to 5 hours in their requisition-approval-process cycle by implementing Coupa’s mobile procurement platform. Talk about savings!

## Marketing Ethics  
### Innocent: Proven Guilty?

Innocent, a smoothie brand, is one of the companies that focuses on the importance of a healthy diet to promote its drinks. Innocent was an especially well-regarded brand in the United Kingdom for its positioning on sustainability and ethical sourcing from fair-trade suppliers (it also donates 10 percent of its profit to help charities); so it drew fire when it entered a controversial partnership with the fast-food chain McDonald’s. Many enthusiasts said that partnering with McDonald’s would reduce Innocent’s brand value.

Innocent aimed to expand the market internationally through McDonald’s outlets, and the company’s founder insisted that the tie-up with McDonald’s was only a business decision that it The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is very useful for marketers.
