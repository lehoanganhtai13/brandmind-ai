# Chapter 1 | Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement

More than just trying to catch lightning in a bottle with one-off “Oreo moments” during showcase events, says one strategist, “keeping pace with the speed of digital culture actually requires marketers to plan ahead.” Says another, “The war room has given way to a campsite—real-time marketing needs to be a built-in strategy all year round.” Smart brands build agile, ongoing real-time marketing programs that listen in on the social space and respond with relevant marketing content that blends smoothly with the dynamics of customers’ real-time social sharing.

For example, although the Oreo “dunk in the dark” tweet might have seemed off the cuff, it was only the latest in a long series of real-time marketing efforts designed to make Oreo a part of consumers’ daily discourse. In the months preceding the Super Bowl, Oreo had successfully carried out its “Daily Twist” campaign. Each day for 100 days, the brand posted consumer-inspired Oreo cookie art tied to a relevant event. There was a Mars Rover Landing Oreo (an open-face cookie with tire tracks through its red crème filling), an Elvis Week Oreo (with an Oreo profile of the King of Rock ’n’ Roll), and a Shark Week Oreo (with a jagged bite taken out of it, of course). The groundbreaking Daily Twist campaign gave Oreo a fourfold increase in Facebook shares and boosted its Instagram following from 2,200 to more than 85,000.

Oreo wages an ongoing social media and mobile campaign to engage consumers in the moment, skillfully injecting the brand into consumers’ lives and conversations. For example, there was the wildly popular “Twist, Lick, Dunk” mobile game app that had 4 million users dunking 4 billion virtual Oreo cookies. Then there was the catchy 90-second “Oreo Cookie Balls” rap video, tweeted and posted on YouTube and other social media, showing clever ideas for eating and serving cookie balls during the end-of-year holiday season—it quickly went viral with more than 1.6 million views on YouTube alone. And leading up to a one Halloween season, Oreo Laboratorium, a series of brief stop-motion videos, showed different Oreo creatures and asked fans to “Name the Nomster.” Such gems illustrate how Oreo keeps itself smack dab in the middle of the consumer consciousness by making real-time marketing an everyday event.

Whether connected to a social cause, a trending topic or event, a consumer’s personal situation, or something else, the essential concept behind successful real-time marketing is pretty simple: Find or create ongoing connections between the brand and what’s happening and important in consumers’ lives, then engage consumers genuinely in the moment. One marketing executive suggests that real-time marketers should equate the practice to “meeting somebody in a social gathering—you don’t accost them, instead you try to find a commonality of interest.”

**NASA uses an extensive array of social media to engage and educate the next generation of space explorers. The agency invites you to “follow, share, and be a part of the conversation on popular social media sites with NASA.”**  
*NASA*

Using social media might involve something as simple as a contest or promotion to garner Facebook Likes, tweets, or YouTube postings. But more often these days, large organizations of all kinds use a wide range of carefully integrated social media. For example, space agency NASA uses a broad mix of social media to educate the next generation of space explorers on its mission to “boldly go where no man has gone before.”

In all, NASA has more than 480 social media accounts spanning various topics and digital platforms. The agency has more than 14 million Facebook fans, 14.5 million Twitter followers, 8.8 million Instagram followers, and 76,000 YouTube subscribers. One of NASA’s largest-ever social media campaigns supported the recent test launch of the Orion spacecraft, which will eventually carry humans to deep space destinations, such as Mars or an asteroid.[31]

The extensive campaign included a dozen or more YouTube “I’m On Board” videos starring actors from classic science-fiction TV shows, such as *Star Trek* and *The Incredible Hulk*. Even *Sesame Street*’s Elmo added his support, proudly displaying his “I’m On Board” boarding pass, chatting up astronauts, and relaying facts and launch information on the *Sesame Street* Twitter feed and other digital platforms. The campaign offered social media users a chance to put their names on a microchip aboard the space vehicle—more than a million people signed on. During the flight, NASA’s social media team briefed the public through Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram posts. In all, it’s a new NASA. People once followed NASA events from afar by gathering around their TV sets. Not anymore. Now, Mobile Marketing
