# 4.1 Social Media Command Centers: Listening to and Engaging Customers in Social Space

Today’s social space is alive with buzz about brands and related happenings and trends. As a result, many companies are now setting up state-of-the-art social media command centers with which they track or even help shape the constant barrage of social media activity surrounding their brands.

Some social media command centers are event-specific. For example, Jaguar set up “The Villain’s Lair,” a social media command center for the express purpose of managing engagement with its Super Bowl ads featuring famous movie villains. But many other organizations, ranging from financial institutions and consumer products companies to not-for-profit organizations, have opened permanent digital command centers to harness the power of today’s burgeoning social media chatter.

For example, Mastercard’s digital intelligence command center—called the Conversation Suite—monitors, analyzes, and responds in real time to millions of online conversations around the world. It monitors online brand-related conversations across 43 markets and 26 languages. It tracks social networks, blogs, online and mobile video, and traditional media—any and every digital place that might contain relevant content or commentary on Mastercard.

At Mastercard’s Purchase, New York, headquarters, Conversation Suite staff huddle with managers from various Mastercard departments and business units in front of a giant 40-foot LED screen that displays summaries of ongoing global brand conversations, refreshed every four minutes. A rotating group of marketing and customer service people spends two or three hours a day in the command center. “It’s a real-time focus group,” says a Mastercard marketing executive. “We track all mentions of Mastercard and any of our products, plus the competition.”

Mastercard uses what it sees, hears, and learns in the Conversation Suite to improve its products and marketing, track brand performance, and spark meaningful customer conversations and engagement. Mastercard is even training “social ambassadors,” who can join online conversations and engage customers and brand influencers directly. “Today, almost everything we do [across the company] is rooted in insights we’re gathering from the Conversation Suite,” says another manager. “[It’s] transforming the way we do business.”

PepsiCo’s Gatorade was one of the first brands to set up a social media command center, called Gatorade Mission Control. The center conducts extensive real-time monitoring of brand-related social media activity. Whenever someone mentions anything related to Gatorade (including competitors, Gatorade athletes, and sports nutrition-related topics) on major social media or blogs, it pops up in various visualizations and dashboards on one of six big screens. Gatorade Mission Control staffers also monitor digital ad, web, and mobile site traffic, producing a consolidated picture of the brand’s internet image. Gatorade uses what it sees and learns at the center to improve its products, marketing, and interactions with customers.

Gatorade Mission Control also lets the brand engage consumers in real time, sometimes adding to or even shaping the online discourse. For example, during Game One of the 2014 NBA Finals, when then-Miami Heat forward LeBron James was carried off the court with leg cramps, Twitter exploded with comments that Gatorade had failed to prevent James’s cramps. Although the former Gatorade spokesman had recently switched to rival Powerade, a Coca-Cola brand, most fans still associated King James with Gatorade. However, at the same time that fans were tweeting concerns about the brand, the Gatorade Mission Control team was countering with its own humorous responses, such as “The person cramping isn’t our client. Our athletes can take the Heat.” When one fan tweet asked where Gatorade was when LeBron James needed it, the team replied, “Waiting on the sidelines, but he prefers to drink something else.” Thus, real-time social media monitoring helped Gatorade turn potentially negative online chatter into a game-winning shot at the buzzer.

All kinds of organizations are now setting up social media command centers, even not-for-profits. For example, the American Red Cross partnered with Dell to create its Digital Operations Center in Washington, DC, which helps the humanitarian relief organization improve its responses to emergencies and natural disasters. The Red Cross got serious about monitoring social media after an opinion poll revealed that 80 percent of Americans expect emergency responders
