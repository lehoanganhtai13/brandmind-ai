# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

The concept has been implemented worldwide, and the companies may earn high revenues from richer countries to cover major cost elements. However, the commission understands that DP alone does not guarantee a complete solution and that it often depends greatly on the cooperation of the pharmaceutical industry. It is difficult for any regulatory body to ensure sustainability or autonomy for countries with low disposable income. Medicine-manufacturing companies will have to be compensated for innovation so that prices are seen as a financial incentive to fund R&D in the pharmaceutical industry.

The EU Council stresses the need to clamp down on potential cases of market abuse, excessive pricing, as well as other market restrictions for European pharmaceutical companies. The challenge seems to be the containment of costs in order to ensure financial sustainability, rewards for R&D promotion, and acceptable pricing for the member states. To deal with this issue effectively, the European Union will have to consider other pricing policy options, such as joint procurement initiatives by EU members for purchase of generic drugs collectively.

Group buying by many countries is likely to increase bargaining power, which could help in lowering prices further.

Pharmaceutical pricing is an issue riddled with questions and dilemmas. The European Commission seems confident about the prospects of improving the existing drug pricing policies and enhancing access to medicines across Europe. On the basis of the recommendations of the commission’s report, the European Union intends to make some technical improvement to drug pricing, especially in EPR pricing. They are planning to perform regular price re-evaluations (at least once a year) and benchmark against actual prices paid by the patients. This helps to identify possible discounts, rebates, and other, similar financial arrangements between pharmaceutical companies and governments. EU members plan to increase research on this issue to collect additional evidence to deal with the pricing issue in an effective way. They would like to engage further key stakeholders in addition to the government and the pharmaceutical industry—such as the patients—through effective communication and consultation. It is also recommended that a platform be created for dialogue between key stakeholders so that they can have an open discussion without being bound to any institutional mandate. Such dialog could allow them to think outside box, and, perhaps, beyond medicine pricing.

The most important pieces of legislation affecting pricing are the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Robinson-Patman Act, initially adopted to curb the formation of monopolies and regulate business practices that might unfairly restrain trade. Because these federal statutes can be applied only to interstate commerce, some states have adopted similar provisions for companies that operate locally.

**Figure 11.2** shows the major public policy issues in pricing. These include potentially damaging pricing practices within a given level of the channel (price-fixing and predatory pricing) and across levels of the channel (retail price maintenance, discriminatory pricing, and deceptive pricing).[^19]

### Figure 11.2  
Public Policy Issues in Pricing

This table illustrates public policy issues in pricing across different levels of a distribution channel, specifically focusing on producer, retailer, and consumer interactions. At the producer level, issues include price-fixing and predatory pricing by Producer A and Producer B. Retailer 1 and Retailer 2 also engage in price-fixing and predatory pricing, with Retailer 1 additionally practicing retail price maintenance and discriminatory pricing. Deceptive pricing is noted as a practice at the retailer level, specifically by Retailer 1 and also generally across channel levels. The structure highlights that major public policy pricing issues occur both within individual channel levels and across these levels, ultimately impacting consumers. The diagram emphasizes the prevalence of various problematic pricing strategies throughout the supply chain.
