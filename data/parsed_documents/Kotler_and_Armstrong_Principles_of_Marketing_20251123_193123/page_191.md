Finally, in the business buying process, the buyer and seller are often much *more dependent* on each other. B-to-B marketers may roll up their sleeves and work closely with customers during all stages of the buying process—from helping customers define problems to finding solutions to supporting after-sale operation. In the short run, sales go to suppliers who meet buyers’ immediate product and service needs. In the long run, however, business-to-business marketers keep customers by meeting current needs *and* by partnering with them to help solve their problems.

> For example, consider agricultural and food giant Cargill’s Cocoa & Chocolate division:³

Cargill's Cocoa & Chocolate division engages in a business-to-business sales model, focusing on partnership and customer success rather than mere product transactions. The core of their strategy involves leveraging deep expertise to help business clients, such as Mars and Mondelēz, enhance their own product offerings and profitability. This is achieved through several key support mechanisms: providing insights into global consumer food trends, offering personalized research and development assistance for product innovation, and delivering technical services to overcome ingredient and application challenges. Cargill's approach extends to practical support, including laboratory and pilot work, production start-up assistance, recipe development, pricing optimization, and faster market entry. Ultimately, Cargill aims to foster customer growth and long-term success by providing comprehensive solutions and expertise in cocoa and chocolate products and applications.

As in Cargill’s case, in recent years, relationships between most customers and suppliers have been changing from downright adversarial to close and chummy. In fact, many customer companies are now practicing **supplier development**, systematically developing networks of supplier-partners to ensure a dependable supply of the products and materials that they use in making their own products or reselling to others. For example, Walmart doesn’t have a “Purchasing Department”; it has a “Supplier Development Department.” The giant retailer knows that it can’t just rely on spot suppliers who might be available when needed. Instead, Walmart manages a huge network of supplier-partners that help provide the hundreds of billions of dollars of goods that it sells to its customers each year.

## Business Buyer Behavior

At the most basic level, marketers want to know how business buyers will respond to various marketing stimuli. Green circle icon Figure 6.1 shows a model of business buyer behavior. In this model, marketing and other stimuli affect the buying organization and produce certain buyer responses. To design good marketing strategies, marketers must understand what happens within the organization to turn stimuli into purchase responses.

Within the organization, buying activity consists of two major parts: the *buying center*, composed of all the people involved in the buying decision, and the *buying decision process*. The model shows that the buying center and the buying decision process are influenced by internal organizational, interpersonal, and individual factors as well as external environmental factors.

The model in Figure 6.1 suggests four questions about business buyer behavior: What buying decisions do business buyers make? Who participates in the business buying process? What are the major influences on buyers? How do business buyers make their buying decisions?
