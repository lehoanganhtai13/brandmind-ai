# 3 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review

In this and the next two chapters, you’ll examine the environments of marketing and how companies analyze these environments to better understand the marketplace and consumers. Companies must constantly watch and manage the *marketing environment* to seek opportunities and ward off threats. The marketing environment consists of all the actors and forces influencing the company’s ability to transact business effectively with its target market.

**OBJECTIVE 3-1**  Describe the environmental forces that affect the company’s ability to serve its customers.  
*(pp 92–96)*

The company’s *microenvironment* consists of actors close to the company that combine to form its value delivery network or that affect its ability to serve customers. It includes the company’s *internal environment*—its several departments and management levels—as it influences marketing decision making. *Marketing channel firms*—suppliers, marketing intermediaries, physical distribution firms, marketing services agencies, and financial intermediaries—cooperate to create customer value. *Competitors* vie with the company in an effort to serve customers better. Various *publics* have an actual or potential interest in or impact on the company’s ability to meet its objectives. Finally, five types of customer *markets* exist: consumer, business, reseller, government, and international markets.

The *macroenvironment* consists of larger societal forces that affect the entire microenvironment. The six forces making up the company’s macroenvironment are demographic, economic, natural, technological, political/social, and cultural forces. These forces shape opportunities and pose threats to the company.

**OBJECTIVE 3-2**  Explain how changes in the demographic and economic environments affect marketing decisions.  
*(pp 96–104)*

*Demography* is the study of the characteristics of human populations. Today’s *demographic environment* shows a changing age structure, shifting family profiles, geographic population shifts, a better-educated and more white-collar population, and increasing diversity. The *economic environment* consists of factors that affect buying power and patterns. The economic environment is characterized by more frugal consumers who are seeking greater value—the right combination of good quality and service at a fair price. The distribution of income also is shifting. The rich have grown richer, the middle class has shrunk, and the poor have remained poor, leading to a two-tiered market.

**OBJECTIVE 3-3**  Identify the major trends in the firm’s natural and technological environments.  
*(pp 104–108)*

The *natural environment* shows three major trends: shortages of certain raw materials, higher pollution levels, and more government intervention in natural resource management. Environmental concerns create marketing opportunities for alert companies. The *technological environment* creates both opportunities and challenges. Companies that fail to keep up with technological change will miss out on new product and marketing opportunities.

**OBJECTIVE 3-4**  Explain the key changes in the political and cultural environments.  
*(pp 108–114)*

The *political environment* consists of laws, agencies, and groups that influence or limit marketing actions. The political environment has undergone changes that affect marketing worldwide: increasing legislation regulating business, strong government agency enforcement, and greater emphasis on ethics and socially responsible actions. The *cultural environment* consists of institutions and forces that affect a society’s values, perceptions, preferences, and behaviors. The environment shows trends toward new technology-enabled communication, a lessening trust of institutions, increasing patriotism, greater appreciation for nature, a changing spiritualism, and the search for more meaningful and enduring values.

**OBJECTIVE 3-5**  Discuss how companies can react to the marketing environment.  
*(pp 114–116)*

Companies can passively accept the marketing environment as an uncontrollable element to which they must adapt, avoiding threats and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. Or they can take a *proactive* stance, working to change the environment rather than simply reacting to it. Whenever possible, companies should try to be proactive rather than reactive.

## Key Terms

This table outlines four distinct marketing objectives, each focusing on a different facet of the marketing environment. Objective 3-1 examines the broader marketing environment, encompassing its microenvironment and macroenvironment, along with key players like marketing intermediaries, publics, and the general marketing environment itself. Objective 3-2 delves into demographic factors, specifically detailing various generational cohorts such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials (Generation Y), and Generation Z, and also includes the economic environment. Objectives 3-3 and 3-4 shift focus to external environmental influences, with Objective 3-3 covering the natural and technological environments, and Objective 3-4 addressing the political and cultural environments. The structure is comparative, presenting distinct but related areas of environmental analysis for marketing strategy.
