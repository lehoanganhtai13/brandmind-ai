Finally, the high failure rate of new products shows that companies are not able to control demand.

On a deeper level, our wants and values are influenced not only by marketers but also by family, peer groups, religion, cultural background, and education. If Americans are highly materialistic, these values arose out of basic socialization processes that go much deeper than business and marketing could produce alone. Consumption patterns and attitudes are also subject to larger forces, such as the economy. As discussed in Chapter 1, the recent Great Recession put a damper on materialism and conspicuous spending.

These days consumers are also more supportive of environmental and social sustainability efforts by companies. As a result, instead of encouraging today’s more sensible and conscientious consumers to overspend or spend wastefully, many marketers are working to help them find greater value with less. For example, Patagonia’s recent “conscious consumption” campaign actually urges its customers to buy less, telling them “Don’t buy what you don’t need.” and “Think twice before you buy anything.” Similarly, L.L Bean’s “When” campaign encourages customers to buy and hang onto products that last rather than always buying new ones. It asks, “When did disposable become our default?” The answer: “At L.L. Bean, it never did. When you buy something from us, we want you to like it for a long time #llasting.”¹²

## Too Few Social Goods

Business has been accused of overselling private goods at the expense of public goods. As private goods increase, they require more public services that are usually not forthcoming. For example, private automobile ownership (private good) requires highways, traffic control, parking spaces, and police services (public goods). The overselling of private goods results in social costs. For cars, some of the social costs include traffic congestion, gasoline shortages, and air pollution. For example, American travelers lose, on average, 42 hours a year in traffic jams, costing the United States more than $160 billion a year—$960 per commuter. In the process, they waste 3.1 billion gallons of fuel (enough to fill the New Orleans Superdome more than four times).¹³

A way must be found to restore a balance between private and public goods. One option is to make producers bear the full social costs of their operations. For example, the government is requiring automobile manufacturers to build cars with more efficient engines and better pollution-control systems. Automakers will then raise their prices to cover the extra costs. If buyers find the price of some car models too high, these models will disappear. Demand will then move to those producers that can support the sum of the private and social costs.

A second option is to make consumers pay the social costs. For example, many cities around the world are now levying congestion tolls and other charges in an effort to reduce traffic congestion. The island nation of Singapore—about the size of three and a half Washington, DCs—has taken such measures to extremes:

> To control traffic congestion and pollution, Singapore’s government makes car ownership very expensive. New car purchases are taxed at 100 percent or more of their market value and buyers must purchase a “certificate of entitlement,” which costs tens of thousands of dollars. As a result, a Toyota Corolla purchased in Singapore runs close to $96,000; a Toyota Prius goes for about $154,000. That plus the high cost of gas and “Electronic Road Pricing” tolls collected automatically as cars are driven around the country makes car ownership prohibitively expensive for most Singaporeans. Only about 15 percent of the population owns a car, keeping congestion, pollution, and other auto evils to a minimum and making Singapore one of the greenest urban areas in Asia.¹⁴

## Cultural Pollution

Critics charge the marketing system with creating *cultural pollution*. They feel our senses are being constantly assaulted by marketing and advertising. ● Commercials interrupt serious programs; pages of ads obscure magazines; billboards mar beautiful scenery; spam fills our email inboxes; flashing display ads intrude on our online and mobile screens. What’s more, the critics claim, these interruptions continually pollute people’s minds with messages of materialism, sex, power, or status. Some critics call for sweeping changes.
