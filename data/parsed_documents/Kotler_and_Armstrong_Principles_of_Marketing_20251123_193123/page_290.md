Companies that combine a customer-centered approach with team-based new product development gain a big competitive edge by getting the right new products to market faster.

## Systematic New Product Development

Finally, the new product development process should be holistic and systematic rather than compartmentalized and haphazard. Otherwise, few new ideas will surface, and many good ideas will sputter and die. To avoid these problems, a company can install an *innovation management system* to collect, review, evaluate, and manage new product ideas.

The company can appoint a respected senior person to be its innovation manager. It can set up web-based idea management software and encourage all company stakeholders—employees, suppliers, distributors, dealers—to become involved in finding and developing new products. It can assign a cross-functional innovation management committee to evaluate proposed new product ideas and help bring good ideas to market. It can also create recognition programs to reward those who contribute the best ideas.

The innovation management system approach yields two favorable outcomes. First, it helps create an innovation-oriented company culture. It shows that top management supports, encourages, and rewards innovation. Second, it will yield a larger number of new product ideas, among which will be found some especially good ones. The good new ideas will be more systematically developed, producing more new product successes. No longer will good ideas wither for the lack of a sounding board or a senior product advocate.

Thus, new product success requires more than simply thinking up a few good ideas, turning them into products, and finding customers for them. It requires a holistic approach for finding new ways to create valued customer experiences, from generating and screening new product ideas to creating and rolling out want-satisfying products to customers. More than this, successful new product development requires a whole-company commitment. Nestlé, for example, successfully carries out strong new product planning and sets up a systematic and customer-driven new product development process for finding and growing new market offerings in order to keep up with an ever-changing environment as well as to define and to drive new markets (see Real Marketing 9.1).

> A company’s products are born, grow, mature, and then decline, just as living things do. To remain vital, the firm must continually develop new products and manage them effectively throughout their life cycles.

### Product life cycle (PLC)  
The course of a product’s sales and profits over its lifetime.

# Product Life-Cycle Strategies

After launching the new product, management wants that product to enjoy a long and happy life. Although it does not expect the product to sell forever, the company wants to earn a decent profit to cover all the effort and risk that went into launching it. Management is aware that each product will have a life cycle, although its exact shape and length is not known in advance.

**Figure 9.2** shows a typical **product life cycle (PLC)**, the course that a product’s sales and profits take over its lifetime. The PLC has five distinct stages:

1. *Product development* begins when the company finds and develops a new product idea. During product development, sales are zero, and the company’s investment costs mount.

This diagram illustrates the typical trajectory of sales and profits throughout a product's life cycle, from its initial conception through to its eventual decline. The horizontal axis represents time, segmented into distinct stages: Product development, Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The vertical axis depicts financial values, with losses and investment shown on the left and sales and profits on the right. Two key trends are visualized: sales, represented by a blue line, and profits, shown in red. Initially, during product development and introduction, both sales and profits are negative, reflecting investment costs. As the product moves into the growth phase, sales begin to rise sharply, followed by profits. The maturity stage sees sales peak and then plateau, while profits also reach their highest point before starting to decline. Finally, in the decline stage, both sales and profits decrease, eventually falling below profitability. This demonstrates a clear, sequential progression of financial performance tied to the product's market presence.

> Some products die quickly; others stay in the mature stage for a long, long time. For example, TABASCO sauce has been around for more than 140 years. Even then, to keep the product young, the company has added a full line of flavors (such as Sweet & Spicy and Chipotle) and a kitchen cabinet full of new TABASCO products (such as salsas, marinades, and a chili mix).
