# During the Interview

During the interview, do the following:

1. Shake hands firmly in greeting the interviewer. Introduce yourself, using the same form of address that the interviewer uses. Focus on creating a good initial impression.  
2. Keep your poise. Relax, smile when appropriate, and be upbeat throughout.  
3. Maintain eye contact and good posture, and speak distinctly. Don’t clasp your hands or fiddle with jewelry, hair, or clothing. Sit comfortably in your chair.  
4. Along with the copies of relevant documents that support your candidacy, carry extra copies of your résumé with you.  
5. Have your story down pat. Present your selling points. Answer questions directly. Avoid either one-word or too-wordy answers.  
6. Let the interviewer take the initiative but don’t be passive. Find an opportunity to direct the conversation to things about yourself that you want the interviewer to hear.  
7. To end on a high note, make your most important point or ask your most pertinent question during the last part of the interview.  
8. Don’t hesitate to “close.” You might say, “I’m very interested in the position, and I have enjoyed this interview.”  
9. Obtain the interviewer’s business card or address and phone number so that you can follow up later.

> A tip for acing the interview: Before you open your mouth, find out *what it’s like* to be a brand manager, sales representative, market researcher, advertising account executive, or other position for which you’re interviewing. See if you can find a “mentor”—someone in a position similar to the one you’re seeking, perhaps with another company. Talk with this mentor about the ins and outs of the job and industry.

# After the Interview

After the interview, do the following:

1. Record the key points that arose. Be sure to note who is to follow up and when a decision can be expected.  
2. Analyze the interview objectively, including the questions asked, the answers to them, your overall interview presentation, and the interviewer’s responses to specific points.  
3. Immediately send a thank-you letter or email, mentioning any additional items and your willingness to supply further information.  
4. If you do not hear from the employer within the specified time, call, email, or write the interviewer to determine your status.

# Follow-Up Interview

If your first interview takes place off-site, such as at your college or at a job fair, and if you are successful with that initial interview, you will be invited to visit the organization. The in-company interview will probably run from several hours to an entire day. The organization will examine your interest, maturity, enthusiasm, assertiveness, logic, and company and functional knowledge. You should ask questions about issues of importance to you. Find out about the working environment, job role, responsibilities, opportunities for advancement, current industrial issues, and the company’s personality. The company wants to discover if you are the right person for the job, whereas you want to find out if it is the right job for you. The key is to determine if the right *fit* exists between you and the company.
