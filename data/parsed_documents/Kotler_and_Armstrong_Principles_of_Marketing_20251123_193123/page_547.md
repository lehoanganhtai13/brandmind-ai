# Extending Marketing

The very definition of aerodynamic.  
*Strategic groups: Brands sometimes cross strategic groups. For example, Ford sells a limited-production, ultra-high performance, $400,000 Ford GT road car that showcases its innovation and technological prowess. The Ford GT is “The very definition of aerodynamic.”*  
Ford Motor Company

Although competition is most intense within a strategic group, there is also rivalry among groups. First, some strategic groups may appeal to overlapping customer segments. For example, no matter what their strategy, most automobile manufacturers offer high-performance vehicle models. Second, customers may not see much difference in the offerings of different groups; they may see little difference in quality between a high-end Ford and a Mercedes. Finally, members of one strategic group might expand into new strategy segments. Thus, Toyota’s Lexus division offered a bespoke Lexus LFA “Supercar” model that rivals a Ferrari or Lamborghini, with a starting price of $375,000. ● And Ford returns to that segment with a limited-production, ultra-high performance, $400,000 Ford GT road car developed alongside a successful racing program to showcase its innovation and technological prowess.

The company needs to look at all the dimensions that identify strategic groups within the industry. It must understand how each competitor delivers value to its customers. It needs to know each competitor’s product quality, features, and mix; customer services; pricing policy; distribution coverage; sales force strategy; and advertising, sales promotion, and online and social media programs. And it must study the details of each competitor’s research and development (R&D), manufacturing, purchasing, financial, and other strategies.

## Assessing Competitors’ Strengths and Weaknesses

Marketers need to carefully assess each competitor’s strengths and weaknesses to answer a critical question: What *can* our competitors do? As a first step, companies can gather data on each competitor’s goals, strategies, and performance over the past few years. Admittedly, some of this information will be hard to obtain. For example, business-to-business (B-to-B) marketers find it hard to estimate competitors’ market shares because they do not have the same syndicated data services that are available to consumer packaged-goods companies.

Companies normally learn about their competitors’ strengths and weaknesses through secondary data, personal experience, and word of mouth. They can also conduct primary marketing research with customers, suppliers, and dealers. They can check competitors’ online and social media sites. Or they can try **benchmarking** themselves against other firms, comparing the company’s products and processes to those of competitors or leading firms in other industries to identify best practices and find ways to improve quality and performance. Benchmarking is a powerful tool for increasing a company’s competitiveness.

## Estimating Competitors’ Reactions

Next, the company wants to know: What *will* our competitors do? A competitor’s objectives, strategies, and strengths and weaknesses go a long way toward explaining its likely actions. They also suggest its likely reactions to company moves, such as price cuts, promotion increases, or new product introductions. In addition, each competitor has a certain philosophy of doing business, a certain internal culture and guiding beliefs. Marketing managers need a deep understanding of a competitor’s mentality if they want to anticipate how that competitor will act or react.

Each competitor reacts differently. Some do not react quickly or strongly to a competitor’s move. They may feel their customers are loyal, they may be slow in noticing the move, or they may lack the funds to react. Some competitors react only to certain types of moves and not to others. Other competitors react swiftly and strongly to any action. Thus, P&G does not allow a competitor’s new product to come easily into the market. Many firms avoid direct competition with P&G and look for easier prey, knowing that P&G will react fiercely if it is challenged. Knowing how major competitors react gives the company clues on how best to attack competitors or how best to defend its current positions.

In some industries, competitors live in relative harmony; in others, competitors are more openly combative. For example, competitors in the U.S. wireless industry have been at each other’s throats for years.
