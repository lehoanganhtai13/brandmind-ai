# Chapter 17 Direct, Online, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing

Kiip now boasts a network of 2,500 apps and 60 million users across games, fitness, productivity, music, and cooking categories. It showcases more than 500 million reward moments every month for clients like McDonald’s, Propel, Sour Patch Kids, P&G, and MasterCard. For fitness apps like MapMyRun and productivity apps like Any.do, Kiip ties rewards to real-life achievements. When users cross things off their to-do lists or achieve a running goal, they get a reward from a relevant brand. For example, P&G’s Secret deodorant recently rewarded female MapMyRun users with free song downloads for their workout playlists. And snack giant Mondelēz rewarded Any.do users with free packs of Trident when they set new personal records.

Kiip helps marketers reach targeted users at positive moments with rewards relevant to their real-time doings and accomplishments. Readers who finish a certain number of pages in a reading app receive a free magazine subscription. People using a couple’s app to stay in touch receive credits toward a purchase from 1-800-Flowers. Kiip is even working with connected-car company Mojio, whose 4G telematic device plugs into a car’s diagnostic port, tracks information about the car’s status, and keeps the owner connected to favorite people, places, and things. Through Mojio, Kiip helps clients—from insurance companies and car repair shops to parking meter and garage operators—provide rewards tied to specific driver locations and behaviors.

Unlike typical banner ads, pop-ups, or emails, Kiip offers enhance a user’s regular activities rather than interrupting them. According to Kiip’s founder and CEO, Kiip “is less about real-time marketing and more about real-time-needs addressing.” In fact, he asserts, Kiip isn’t really in the mobile ad business at all—it’s in the happiness business. “We want to capitalize on happiness,” he says. “Everything’s better when you’re happy.” Mobile timeliness, relevance, and happiness pay off in terms of consumer response. Users redeem Kiip’s mobile promotions at a 22-percent clip compared with the 0.3 percent for typical app ad engagement. Kiip’s offers also increase mobile app revisits by 30 percent and more than double average app length of use.

Many consumers are initially skeptical about mobile marketing. But they often change their minds if mobile offers deliver useful brand and shopping information, entertaining content, or timely coupons and discounted prices. Most mobile efforts target only consumers who voluntarily opt in or download apps. In the increasingly cluttered mobile marketing space, customers just won’t do that unless they see real value in it. The challenge for marketers: develop valued mobile offers, ads, and apps that make customers come calling.

Today’s rich-media mobile ads can create substantial engagement and impact. For example, Macy’s built a recent “Brasil: A Magical Journey” promotion around a popular and imaginative smartphone app. The campaign featured apparel from Brazilian designers and in-store experiences celebrating Brazilian culture. By using their smartphones to scan codes throughout the store, shoppers could learn about featured fashions and experience Brazilian culture through virtual tours, such as a trip to the Amazon, a visit to Rio de Janeiro during Carnival, or attending a Brazilian soccer match.

Most marketers have created their own mobile online sites, optimized for specific phones and mobile service providers. Others have created useful or entertaining mobile apps to engage customers with their brands and help them shop. For example, the Benjamin Moore Color Capture app lets customers take photos of colorful objects, then match them to any of 3,500 Benjamin Moore paint colors. Starbucks’s mobile app lets customers use their phones as a Starbucks card to make fast and easy purchases. And Charles Schwab’s mobile apps let customers get up-to-the-minute investment news, monitor their accounts, and make trades at any time from any location—it helps you “stay connected with your money.”

As with other forms of direct marketing, however, companies must use mobile marketing responsibly or risk angering already ad-weary consumers. Most people don’t want to be interrupted regularly by advertising, so marketers must be smart about how they engage people on mobile devices. The key is to provide genuinely useful information and offers that will make consumers want to engage. And many marketers target mobile ads on an opt-in-only basis.

In all, digital direct marketing—online, social media, and mobile marketing—offers both great promise and many challenges for the future. Its most ardent apostles still envision a time when the internet and digital marketing will replace magazines, newspapers, and even stores as sources for information, engagement, and buying. Most marketers, however, hold a more realistic view. For most companies, digital and social media marketing will remain just one important approach to the marketplace that works alongside other approaches in a fully integrated marketing mix.
