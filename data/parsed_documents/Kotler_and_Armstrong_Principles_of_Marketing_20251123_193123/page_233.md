# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Many companies have introduced differentiations that failed one or more of these tests. When the Westin Stamford Hotel in Singapore once advertised itself as the world’s tallest hotel, it was a distinction that was not important to most tourists; in fact, it turned many off. Similarly, Coca-Cola’s classic product failure—New Coke—failed the superiority and importance tests among core Coca-Cola drinkers:

> Extensive blind taste tests showed that 60 percent of all soft drink consumers chose a new, sweeter Coca-Cola formulation over the original Coke, and 52 percent chose it over Pepsi. So the brand dropped its original-formula Coke and, with much fanfare, replaced it with New Coke, a sweeter, smoother version. However, in its research, Coca-Cola overlooked the many intangibles that have made Coca-Cola so popular for 130 years. To loyal Coke drinkers, the original beverage stands alongside baseball, apple pie, and the Statue of Liberty as an American institution. As it turns out, Coca-Cola differentiates its brand not just by taste but by tradition. By dropping the original formula, Coca-Cola trampled on the sensitivities of the huge core of loyal Coke drinkers who loved Coke just the way it was. After only three months, the company brought the classic Coke back.

Thus, choosing competitive advantages on which to position a product or service can be difficult, yet such choices are crucial to success. Choosing the right differentiators can help a brand stand out from the pack of competitors.

## Selecting an Overall Positioning Strategy

> **Value proposition**  
> The full positioning of a brand—the full mix of benefits on which it is positioned.

The full positioning of a brand is called the brand’s **value proposition**—the full mix of benefits on which a brand is differentiated and positioned. It is the answer to the customer’s question “Why should I buy your brand?” BMW’s “ultimate driving machine / designed for driving pleasure” value proposition hinges on performance but also includes luxury and styling, all for a price that is higher than average but seems fair for this mix of benefits.

**Figure 7.4** shows possible value propositions on which a company might position its products. In the figure, the five green cells on the top and right represent winning value propositions—differentiation and positioning that give the company a competitive advantage. The red cells at the lower left, however, represent losing value propositions. The center cell represents at best a marginal proposition. In the following sections, we discuss the five winning value propositions: more for more, more for the same, the same for less, less for much less, and more for less.

### More for More

*More-for-more* positioning involves providing the most upscale product or service and charging a higher price to cover the higher costs. A more-for-more market offering not only offers higher quality, it also gives prestige to the buyer. It symbolizes status and a loftier lifestyle. Four Seasons hotels, Patek Philippe watches, Starbucks coffee, Louis Vuitton handbags, Mercedes automobiles, SubZero appliances—each claims superior quality, craftsmanship, durability, performance, or style and therefore charges a higher price.

Similarly, the marketers of Hearts On Fire diamonds have created a more-for-more niche as “The World’s Most Perfectly Cut Diamond.” Hearts On Fire diamonds have a unique “hearts and arrow” design. When viewed under magnification from the bottom, a

Figure 7.4 outlines possible value propositions by cross-referencing the level of benefits offered against the price charged. The structure is a 3x3 matrix, with "Benefits" on one axis (More, The same, Less) and "Price" on the other (More, The same, Less). Each cell represents a distinct value proposition. "More for more" signifies higher benefits at a higher price. "More for the same" offers increased benefits at a comparable price. "More for less" provides greater benefits for a lower price. "The same for less" delivers equivalent benefits at a reduced price, and "Less for much less" offers reduced benefits at a significantly lower price. Some cells are marked in red, indicating potentially unsustainable or undesirable propositions, while others are yellow, suggesting a less optimal but potentially viable position. The overall framework illustrates how companies can position their offerings based on the interplay of perceived benefits and price points.
