# Cause-Related Marketing

These days, every product seems to be tied to some cause. For example, the P&G “Tide Loads of Hope” program provides mobile laundromats and loads of clean laundry to families in disaster-stricken areas—P&G washes, dries, and folds clothes for these families for free.

Shake Shack runs an annual Great American Shake Sale:  
If you donate at least $2 at the register to Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry program dedicated to ending child hunger in America, you get a $5 shake free on your next visit.  
And AT&T joined forces with competitors Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile to spearhead the “It Can Wait” campaign, which addresses the texting-while-driving epidemic by urging people of all ages to take the pledge to never text and drive. The campaign’s cause-related message: “No text is worth the risk. It can wait.”[^41]

Some companies are founded on cause-related missions. Under the concept of “values-led business” or “caring capitalism,” their mission is to use business to make the world a better place. For example, Warby Parker—the online marketer of low-priced prescription eyewear—was founded with the hope of bringing affordable eyewear to the masses. The company sells “eyewear with a purpose.” For every pair of glasses Warby Parker sells, it distributes a free pair to someone in need. The company also works with not-for-profit organizations that train low-income entrepreneurs to sell affordable glasses. “We believe that everyone has the right to see,” says the company.[^42]

Cause-related marketing has become a primary form of corporate giving. It lets companies “do well by doing good” by linking purchases of the company’s products or services with benefiting worthwhile causes or charitable organizations. Beyond being socially admirable, Warby Parker’s Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program also makes good economic sense, for both the company and its customers. “Companies can do good in the world while still being profitable,” says Warby Parker co-founder Neil Blumenthal. “A single pair of reading glasses causes, on average, a 20 percent increase in income. Glasses are one of the most effective poverty alleviation tools in the world.”[^43]

Cause-related marketing has also stirred some controversy. Critics worry that cause-related marketing is more a strategy for selling than a strategy for giving—that “cause-related” marketing is really “cause-exploitative” marketing. Thus, companies using cause-related marketing might find themselves walking a fine line between increased sales and an improved image and facing charges of exploitation. However, if handled well, cause-related marketing can greatly benefit both the company and the cause. The company gains an effective marketing tool while building a more positive public image. The charitable organization or cause gains greater visibility and important new sources of funding and support. Spending on cause-related marketing in the United States skyrocketed from only $120 million in 1990 to $2 billion in 2016.[^44]
