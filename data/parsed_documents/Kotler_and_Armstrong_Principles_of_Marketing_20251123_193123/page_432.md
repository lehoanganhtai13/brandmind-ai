process. This understanding helps marketers allocate their communication dollars more efficiently and effectively.

To communicate effectively, marketers need to understand how communication works. Communication involves the nine elements shown in **Figure 14.2**. Two of these elements are the major parties in a communication—the *sender* and the *receiver*. Another two are the major communication tools—the *message* and the *media*. Four more are major communication functions—*encoding*, *decoding*, *response*, and *feedback*. The last element is *noise* in the system. Definitions of these elements follow and are applied to a McDonald’s “i’m lovin’ it” television commercial.

* **Sender.** The *party sending the message* to another party—here, McDonald’s.  
* **Encoding.** The process of *putting thought into symbolic form*—for example, McDonald’s ad agency assembles words, sounds, and illustrations into a TV advertisement that will convey the intended message.  
* **Message.** The *set of symbols* that the sender transmits—the actual McDonald’s ad.  
* **Media.** The *communication channels* through which the message moves from the sender to the receiver—in this case, television and the specific television programs that McDonald’s selects.  
* **Decoding.** The process by which the receiver *assigns meaning to the symbols* encoded by the sender—a consumer watches the McDonald’s commercial and interprets the words and images it contains.  
* **Receiver.** The *party receiving the message* sent by another party—the customer who watches the McDonald’s ad.  
* **Response.** The *reactions of the receiver* after being exposed to the message—any of hundreds of possible responses, such as the consumer likes McDonald’s better, is more likely to eat at McDonald’s next time, hums the “i’m lovin’ it” jingle, or does nothing.  
* **Feedback.** The part of the *receiver’s response communicated back to the sender*—McDonald’s research shows that consumers are either struck by and remember the ad or they email or call McDonald’s, praising or criticizing the ad or its products.  
* **Noise.** The *unplanned static or distortion* during the communication process, which results in the receiver getting a different message than the one the sender sent—the consumer is distracted while watching the commercial and misses its key points.

For a message to be effective, the sender’s encoding process must mesh with the receiver’s decoding process. The best messages consist of words and other symbols that are familiar to the receiver. The more the sender’s field of experience overlaps

This table illustrates a communication model, outlining a process-based flow. The core components are the Sender and Receiver, who engage in communication through a Message. The process involves the Sender Encoding the message, which then travels through Media, potentially affected by Noise. The Receiver then Decodes the message. Crucially, the model incorporates Feedback from the Receiver, which influences the Sender, and a Response from the Receiver. The effectiveness of this communication is further contextualized by the Sender's and Receiver's respective fields of experience, suggesting that shared understanding or differences in these areas can impact the communication process. We now examine the steps in developing an effective integrated communications and promotion program.
