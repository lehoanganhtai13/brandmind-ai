# Competition-Based Pricing

Competition-based pricing involves setting prices based on competitors’ strategies, costs, prices, and market offerings. Consumers will base their judgments of a product’s value on the prices that competitors charge for similar products.

In assessing competitors’ pricing strategies, a company should ask several questions. First, how does the company’s market offering compare with competitors’ offerings in terms of customer value? If consumers perceive that the company’s product or service provides greater value, the company can charge a higher price. If consumers perceive less value relative to competing products, the company must either charge a lower price or change customer perceptions to justify a higher price.

Next, how strong are current competitors, and what are their current pricing strategies? If the company faces a host of smaller competitors charging high prices relative to the value they deliver, it might charge lower prices to drive weaker competitors from the market. If the market is dominated by larger, lower-price competitors, a company may decide to target unserved market niches by offering value-added products and services at higher prices.

Importantly, the goal is not to match or beat competitors’ prices. Rather, the goal is to set prices according to the relative value created versus competitors. If a company creates greater value for customers, higher prices are justified. For example, Caterpillar makes high-quality, heavy-duty construction and mining equipment. It dominates its industry despite charging higher prices than competitors such as Komatsu. When a commercial customer once asked a Caterpillar dealer why it should pay $500,000 for a big Caterpillar bulldozer when it could get an “equivalent” Komatsu dozer for $420,000, the Caterpillar dealer famously provided an analysis like the following:

This data presents a comparative pricing structure for a Caterpillar bulldozer, detailing its value-added components relative to a competitor's equivalent model priced at $420,000. Caterpillar's bulldozer incorporates several value-adding features: superior reliability and durability contribute $50,000, lower lifetime operating costs add $40,000, superior service adds $40,000, and a longer parts warranty contributes $20,000. These cumulative additions result in a total value-added price of $570,000 for the Caterpillar bulldozer. A discount of $70,000 is then applied, leading to a final price of $500,000. The structure highlights how specific attributes enhance the perceived and actual value of the Caterpillar product beyond its base price equivalence.

Thus, although the customer pays an $80,000 price premium for the Caterpillar bulldozer, it’s actually getting $150,000 in added value over the product’s lifetime. The customer chose the Caterpillar bulldozer.

What principle should guide decisions about prices to charge relative to those of competitors? The answer is simple in concept but often difficult in practice: No matter what price you charge—high, low, or in between—be certain to give customers superior value for that price.

# Other Internal and External Considerations Affecting Price Decisions

Beyond customer value perceptions, costs, and competitor strategies, the company must consider several additional internal and external factors. Internal factors affecting pricing include the company’s overall marketing strategy, objectives, and marketing mix as well as other organizational considerations. External factors include the nature of the market and demand and other environmental factors.
