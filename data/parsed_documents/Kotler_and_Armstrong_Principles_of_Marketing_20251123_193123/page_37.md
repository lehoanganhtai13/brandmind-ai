# Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process

## Selling concept

The idea that consumers will not buy enough of the firm’s products unless the firm undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion effort.

**The Selling Concept.** Many companies follow the **selling concept**, which holds that consumers will not buy enough of the firm’s products unless it undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion effort. The selling concept is typically practiced with unsought goods—those that buyers do not normally think of buying, such as life insurance or blood donations. These industries must be good at tracking down prospects and selling them on a product’s benefits.

Such aggressive selling, however, carries high risks. It focuses on creating sales transactions rather than on building long-term, profitable customer relationships. The aim often is to sell what the company makes rather than to make what the market wants. It assumes that customers who are coaxed into buying the product will like it. Or, if they don’t like it, they will possibly forget their disappointment and buy it again later. These are usually poor assumptions.

## Marketing concept

A philosophy in which achieving organizational goals depends on knowing the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions better than competitors do.

**The Marketing Concept.** The **marketing concept** holds that achieving organizational goals depends on knowing the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions better than competitors do. Under the marketing concept, customer focus and value are the *paths* to sales and profits. Instead of a product-centered *make-and-sell* philosophy, the marketing concept is a customer-centered *sense-and-respond* philosophy. The job is not to find the right customers for your product but to find the right products for your customers.

**Figure 1.3** contrasts the selling concept and the marketing concept. The selling concept takes an *inside-out* perspective. It starts with the factory, focuses on the company’s existing products, and calls for heavy selling and promotion to obtain profitable sales. It focuses primarily on customer conquest—getting short-term sales with little concern about who buys or why.

In contrast, the marketing concept takes an *outside-in* perspective. As Herb Kelleher, the colorful founder of Southwest Airlines, once put it, “We don’t have a marketing department; we have a customer department.” The marketing concept starts with a well-defined market, focuses on customer needs, and integrates all the marketing activities that affect customers. In turn, it yields profits by creating relationships with the right customers based on customer value and satisfaction.

Implementing the marketing concept often means more than simply responding to customers’ stated desires and obvious needs. *Customer-driven* companies research customers deeply to learn about their desires, gather new product ideas, and test product improvements. Such customer-driven marketing usually works well when a clear need exists and when customers know what they want.

In many cases, however, customers *don’t* know what they want or even what is possible. As Henry Ford once remarked, “If I’d asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” For example, even 20 years ago, how many consumers would have thought to ask for now-commonplace products such as tablet computers, smartphones, digital cameras, 24-hour online buying, digital video and music streaming, and GPS systems in their cars and phones? Such situations call for *customer-driving* marketing—understanding customer needs even better than customers themselves do and creating products and services that meet both existing and latent needs, now and in the future. As an executive at 3M put it, “Our goal is to lead customers where they want to go before *they* know where they want to go.”

Figure 1.3 contrasts the selling concept with the marketing concept, illustrating their differing approaches to business strategy. The selling concept originates from the factory, focusing on existing products and employing selling and promotion as its primary means to achieve profits through high sales volume. In contrast, the marketing concept is market-oriented, with its starting point being the market itself. Its focus lies on understanding and addressing customer needs, utilizing integrated marketing as its means. The ultimate end goal of the marketing concept is to achieve profits through customer satisfaction. This highlights a fundamental shift from a product-centric, push-oriented strategy to a customer-centric, pull-oriented strategy.

> The selling concept takes an inside-out view that focuses on existing products and heavy selling. The aim is to sell what the company makes rather than making what the customer wants.

> The marketing concept takes an outside-in view that focuses on satisfying customer needs as a path to profits. As Southwest Airlines's colorful founder puts it, “We don’t have a marketing department; we have a customer department.” ----
