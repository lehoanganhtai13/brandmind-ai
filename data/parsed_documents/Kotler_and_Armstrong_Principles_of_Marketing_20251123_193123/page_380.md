# Marketing Channels: Delivering Customer Value

A company must decide on *how many* and *what types* of warehouses it needs and *where* they will be located. The company might use either **storage warehouses** or **distribution centers**. Storage warehouses store goods for moderate to long periods. In contrast, **distribution centers** are designed to move goods rather than just store them. They are large and highly automated warehouses designed to receive goods from various plants and suppliers, take orders, fill them efficiently, and deliver goods to customers as quickly as possible.

For example, Amazon operates more than 100 giant distribution centers, called fulfillment centers, which fill online orders and handle returns. These centers are huge and highly automated. For example, the Amazon fulfillment center in Tracy, California, covers 1.2 million square feet (equivalent to 27 football fields). At the center, 4,000 employees control an inventory of 21 million items and ship out up to 700,000 packages a day to Amazon customers in Northern California and parts of the Pacific Northwest. During last year’s Cyber Monday, Amazon’s fulfillment center network filled customer orders at a rate of more than 500 items per second globally.

Like almost everything else these days, warehousing has seen dramatic changes in technology in recent years. Outdated materials-handling methods are steadily being replaced by newer, computer-controlled systems requiring fewer employees. Computers and scanners read orders and direct lift trucks, electric hoists, or robots to gather goods, move them to loading docks, and issue invoices. For example, to improve efficiency in its massive fulfillment centers, Amazon recently purchased robot maker Kiva Systems:

> When you buy from Amazon, the chances are still good that your order will be plucked and packed by human hands.  
> ● However, the humans in Amazon’s fulfillment centers are increasingly being assisted by an army of squat, ottoman-size, day-glo orange robots. Amazon now has more than 30,000 of them in 13 fulfillment centers, double the number from a year ago. The robots bring racks of merchandise to workers, who in turn fill boxes. Dubbed the “magic shelf,” racks of items simply materialize in front of workers, with red lasers pointing to items to be picked. The robots then drive off and new shelves appear. The super-efficient robots work tirelessly 16 hours a day, seven days a week. They never complain about the workload or ask for pay raises, and they are pretty much maintenance free. “When they run low on power, they head to battery-charging terminals,” notes one observer, “or, as warehouse personnel say, ‘They get themselves a drink of water.’”

## Inventory Management

Inventory management also affects customer satisfaction. Here, managers must maintain the delicate balance between carrying too little inventory and carrying too much. With too little stock, the firm risks not having products when customers want to buy. To remedy this, the firm may need costly emergency shipments or production. Carrying too much inventory results in higher-than-necessary inventory-carrying costs and stock obsolescence. Thus, in managing inventory, firms must balance the costs of carrying larger inventories against resulting sales and profits.

Many companies have greatly reduced their inventories and related costs through *just-in-time* logistics systems. With such systems, producers and retailers carry only small inventories of parts or merchandise, often enough for only a few days of operations. New stock arrives exactly when needed rather than being stored in inventory until being used. Just-in-time systems require accurate forecasting along with fast, frequent, and flexible delivery so that new supplies will be available when needed. However, these systems result in substantial savings in inventory-carrying and inventory-handling costs.

Marketers are always looking for new ways to make inventory management more efficient. In the not-too-distant future, handling inventory might even become fully automated. For example, many companies now use some form of RFID or “smart tag” technology, by which small transmitter chips are embedded in or placed on products and packaging for everything from flowers and razors to tires. Such “smart” products could make the entire supply chain—which accounts for up to 75 percent of a product’s cost—intelligent and automated.
