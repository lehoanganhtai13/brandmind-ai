# Primary Data Collection

Secondary data provide a good starting point for research and often help to define research problems and objectives. In most cases, however, the company must also collect primary data. **Table 4.1** shows that designing a plan for primary data collection calls for a number of decisions on *research approaches*, *contact methods*, the *sampling plan*, and *research instruments*.

## Research Approaches

Research approaches for gathering primary data include observation, surveys, and experiments. We discuss each one in turn.

### Observational research

Gathering primary data by observing relevant people, actions, and situations.

**Observational Research.** Observational research involves gathering primary data by observing relevant people, actions, and situations. For example, food retailer Trader Joe’s might evaluate possible new store locations by checking traffic patterns, neighborhood conditions, and the locations of competing Whole Foods, Fresh Market, and other retail chains.

Researchers often observe consumer behavior to glean customer insights they can’t obtain by simply asking customers questions. For instance, Fisher-Price has established an observation lab in which it can observe the reactions little tots have to new toys. The Fisher-Price Play Lab is a sunny, toy-strewn space where lucky kids get to test Fisher-Price prototypes under the watchful eyes of designers who hope to learn what will get them worked up into a new-toy frenzy. In the lab, some 3,500 kids participate each year testing 1,200 products annually. “Our designers watch and learn from how [children] play,” says a Fisher-Price child research manager. “It really helps us make better products.”[^10]

Marketers not only observe what consumers do but also observe what consumers are saying. As discussed earlier, marketers now routinely listen in on consumer conversations on blogs, social media, and websites. Observing such naturally occurring feedback can provide inputs that simply can’t be gained through more structured and formal research approaches.

### Ethnographic research

A form of observational research that involves sending trained observers to watch and interact with consumers in their “natural environments.”

A wide range of companies now use **ethnographic research**. Ethnographic research involves sending observers to watch and interact with consumers in their “natural environments.” The observers might be trained anthropologists and psychologists or company researchers and managers. For example, Coors insights teams frequent bars and other locations in a top-secret small-town location—they call it the “Outpost”—within a day’s drive of Chicago. The researchers use the town as a real-life lab, hob-knobbing anonymously with bar patrons, supermarket shoppers, restaurant diners, convenience store clerks, and other townspeople to gain authentic insights into how middle American consumers buy, drink, dine, and socialize around Coors and competing beer brands.[^11]

Global branding firm Landor launched Landor Families, an ongoing ethnographic study that has followed 11 French families intensely for the past seven years. Landor researchers visit the families twice a year in their homes, diving deeply into both their refrigerators and their food shopping behaviors and opinions. The researchers also shop with the families at their local supermarkets and look over their shoulders while they shop online. The families furnish monthly online reports detailing their shopping behaviors and opinions. The Landor Families study provides rich behavioral insights for Landor clients such as Danone, Kraft Foods, and Procter & Gamble. Today’s big data analytics can provide important insights into the whats, whens, and wheres of consumer buying. The Landor Families

### Table 4.1 | Planning Primary Data Collection

This table outlines key components of research design, presenting a comparative structure across four main categories: Research Approaches, Contact Methods, Sampling Plan, and Research Instruments. Under Research Approaches, the methods include Observation, Survey, and Experiment. Contact Methods are categorized as Mail, Telephone, Personal, and Online. The Sampling Plan encompasses the Sampling unit, Sample size, and Sampling procedure. Finally, Research Instruments are listed as Questionnaire and Mechanical instruments. The arrangement suggests that for any given research endeavor, choices must be made within each of these four areas to define the overall research strategy and execution.
