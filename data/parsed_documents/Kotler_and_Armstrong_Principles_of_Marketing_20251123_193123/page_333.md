# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines five key objectives related to pricing strategies. It begins with **New Product Pricing Strategies**, focusing on initial pricing approaches for novel offerings. This is followed by **Product Mix Pricing Strategies**, which addresses how to set prices for a range of related products to maximize overall profit. The subsequent section, **Price Adjustment Strategies**, details methods for modifying prices based on customer segments and specific circumstances. The content then moves to **Price Changes**, examining the dynamics of initiating and reacting to price alterations. Finally, **Public Policy and Pricing** covers the social and legal considerations that influence pricing decisions. The structure progresses from initial product launch pricing through ongoing adjustments and external constraints.

**AS THE APPLE STORY** suggests, and as we learned in the previous chapter, pricing decisions are subject to a complex array of company, environmental, and competitive forces. To make things even more complex, a company does not set a single price but rather a *pricing structure* that covers different items in its line. This pricing structure changes over time as products move through their life cycles. The company adjusts its prices to reflect changes in costs and demand and to account for variations in buyers and situations. As the competitive environment changes, the company considers when to initiate price changes and when to respond to them.

This chapter examines additional pricing approaches used in special pricing situations or to adjust prices to meet changing situations. We look in turn at *new product pricing* for products in the introductory stage of the product life cycle, *product mix pricing* for related products in the product mix, *price adjustment tactics* that account for customer differences and changing situations, and strategies for initiating and responding to *price changes*.

> **Author Comment:** Pricing new products can be especially challenging. Just think about all the things you’d need to consider in pricing a new smartphone, say, the first Apple iPhone. Even more, you need to start thinking about the price—along with many other marketing considerations—at the very beginning of the design process.

## New Product Pricing Strategies

Pricing strategies usually change as the product passes through its life cycle. The introductory stage is especially challenging. Companies bringing out a new product face the challenge of setting prices for the first time. They can choose between two broad strategies: *market-skimming pricing* and *market-penetration pricing*.

### Market-Skimming Pricing

**Market-skimming pricing (price skimming)**  
Setting a high price for a new product to skim maximum revenues layer by layer from the segments willing to pay the high price; the company makes fewer but more profitable sales.

Many companies that invent new products set high initial prices to *skim* revenues layer by layer from the market. Apple frequently uses this strategy, called **market-skimming pricing** (or **price skimming**). With each new generation of Apple iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer, new models start at a high price then work their way down as newer models are introduced. In this way, Apple skims the maximum amount of revenue from the various segments of the market. For example, through smart premium pricing, Apple vacuums up as much as 92 percent of all smartphone profits.
