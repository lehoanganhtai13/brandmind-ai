Approaches to bring them in line with changing economic conditions and consumer price perceptions. More and more, marketers have adopted the strategy of **good-value pricing** — offering the right combination of quality and good service at a fair price.

In many cases, this has involved introducing less-expensive versions of established brand name products or new lower-price lines. For example, Walmart launched an extreme-value store brand called Price First. Priced even lower than the retailer’s already-low-priced Great Value brand, Price First offers thrift-conscious customers rock-bottom prices on grocery staples. Good-value prices are a relative thing—even premium brands can launch value versions.  
● Mercedes-Benz recently released its CLA Class, entry-level models starting at $31,500. From its wing-like dash and diamond-block grille to its 208-hp turbo inline-4 engine, the CLA Class gives customers “The Art of Seduction. At a price reduction.”[^4]

In other cases, good-value pricing involves redesigning existing brands to offer more quality for a given price or the same quality for less. Some companies even succeed by offering less value but at very low prices. For example, Spirit Airlines gives customers “Bare Fare” pricing, by which they get less but don’t pay for what they don’t get.

An important type of good-value pricing at the retail level is called *everyday low pricing* (EDLP). EDLP involves charging a constant, everyday low price with few or no temporary price discounts. The ALDI supermarket chain practices EDLP, with a good-value pricing value proposition that gives customers “more ‘mmm’ for the dollar” every minute of every day. Perhaps the king of EDLP is Walmart, which practically defined the concept. Except for a few sale items every month, Walmart promises everyday low prices on everything it sells. In contrast, *high-low pricing* involves charging higher prices on an everyday basis but running frequent promotions to lower prices temporarily on selected items. Department stores such as Kohl’s and JCPenney practice high-low pricing by having frequent sale days, early-bird savings, and bonus earnings for store credit-card holders.

# Value-added pricing  
Attaching value-added features and services to differentiate a company’s offers and charging higher prices.

Value-Added Pricing  
Value-based pricing doesn’t mean simply charging what customers want to pay or setting low prices to meet competition. Instead, many companies adopt **value-added pricing** strategies. Rather than cutting prices to match competitors, they add quality, services, and value-added features to differentiate their offers and thus support their higher prices.

● For example, Philips has relied on its investments in research and innovation based on meticulous customer insights to offer greater value. Philips’s lighting division, for instance, works on creating energy-efficient solutions for home and office users. More than 20 percent of the world’s total electricity is used by lighting these days, and 75 percent of current urban lighting is energy inefficient. As the public sector in many countries invests heavily in more energy-efficient technologies, Philips is surging ahead with its innovative lighting solutions. One of its latest offerings is connected LED lighting systems and services, which it claims will save energy as well as enable their customers work more efficiently and productively. The company intends to win the consumer market in professional lighting systems and is gearing up to do this by driving more innovation and by becoming more customer centric.[^5]
