# Learning Aids That Create Value and Engagement

A wealth of chapter-opening, within-chapter, and end-of-chapter learning devices help students to learn, link, and apply major concepts:

* *Integrated chapter-opening preview sections.* The active and integrative chapter-opening spread in each chapter starts with a *Chapter Preview*, which briefly previews chapter concepts, links them with previous chapter concepts, and introduces the chapter-opening story. This leads to a chapter-opening vignette—an engaging, deeply developed, illustrated, and annotated marketing story that introduces the chapter material and sparks student interest. Finally, an *Objective Outline* provides a helpful preview of chapter contents and learning objectives, complete with page numbers.
* *Real Marketing highlights.* Each chapter contains two carefully developed highlight features that provide an in-depth look at real marketing practices of large and small companies.
* *Author comments and figure annotations.* Each figure contains author comments that ease student understanding and help organize major text sections.
* *Reviewing and Extending the Concepts.* Sections at the end of each chapter summarize key chapter concepts and provide questions and exercises by which students can review and apply what they’ve learned. The *Objectives Review and Key Terms* section reviews major chapter concepts and links them to chapter objectives. It also provides a helpful listing of chapter key terms by order of appearance with page numbers that facilitate easy reference. A *Discussion and Critical Thinking* section provides discussion questions and critical thinking exercises that help students to keep track of and apply what they’ve learned in the chapter.
* *Applications and Cases.* Brief *Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing; Marketing Ethics;* and *Marketing by the Numbers* sections at the end of each chapter provide short applications cases that facilitate discussion of current issues and company situations in areas such as mobile and social marketing, ethics, and financial marketing analysis. A *Video Case* section contains short vignettes with discussion questions to be used with a set four- to seven-minute videos that accompanied the seventeenth edition. End-of-chapter *Company Case* sections provide all-new or revised company cases that help students to apply major marketing concepts to real company and brand situations.
* *Marketing Plan appendix.* Appendix 1 contains a sample marketing plan that helps students to apply important marketing planning concepts.
* *Marketing by the Numbers appendix.* An innovative Appendix 2 provides students with a comprehensive introduction to the marketing financial analysis that helps to guide, assess, and support marketing decisions. An exercise at the end of each chapter lets students apply analytical and financial thinking to relevant chapter concepts and links the chapter to the Marketing by the Numbers appendix.

More than ever before, the seventeenth edition of *Principles of Marketing* creates value and engagement for you—it gives you all you need to know about marketing in an effective and enjoyable total learning package!
