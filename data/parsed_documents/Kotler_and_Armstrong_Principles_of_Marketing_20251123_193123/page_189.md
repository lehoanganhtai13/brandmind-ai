# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines key objectives and corresponding sections related to business buyer behavior and marketing. It begins by identifying major factors influencing business buyer behavior, followed by a definition of the steps within the business buying decision process. The material then addresses the impact of new information technologies, including online, mobile, and social media, on business-to-business marketing. Finally, it compares institutional and government markets, explaining the distinct buying decision processes employed by buyers in these sectors. The structure appears to be a progressive exploration of business marketing concepts, moving from foundational influences to specific market types and modern digital strategies.

## Business buyer behavior

The buying behavior of organizations that buy goods and services for use in the production of other products and services that are sold, rented, or supplied to others.

## Business buying process

The decision process by which business buyers determine which products and services their organizations need to purchase and then find, evaluate, and choose among alternative suppliers and brands.

> **In one way or** another, most large companies sell to other organizations. Companies such as IBM, Boeing, DuPont, Caterpillar, and countless other firms sell *most* of their products to other businesses. Even large consumer products companies, which make products used by final consumers, must first sell their products to other businesses. For example, General Mills makes many familiar consumer brands—Big G cereals (Cheerios, Wheaties, Trix, Chex, Total, Fiber One), baking products (Pillsbury, Betty Crocker, Bisquick, Gold Medal flour), snacks (Nature Valley, Bugles, Chex Mix), Yoplait yogurt, Häagen-Dazs ice cream, and many others. But to sell these products to consumers, General Mills must first sell them to its wholesaler and retailer customers, who in turn serve the consumer market.

**Business buyer behavior** refers to the buying behavior of organizations that buy goods and services for use in the production of other products and services that are sold, rented, or supplied to others. It also includes the behavior of retailing and wholesaling firms that acquire goods to resell or rent to others at a profit. In the **business buying process**, business buyers determine which products and services their organizations need to purchase and then find, evaluate, and choose among alternative suppliers and brands. *Business-to-business (B-to-B) marketers* must do their best to understand business markets and business buyer behavior. Then, like businesses that sell to final buyers, they must engage business customers and build profitable relationships with them by creating superior customer value.

> Business markets operate “behind the scenes” to most consumers. Most of the things you buy involve many sets of business purchases before you ever see them.

## Business Markets

The business market is *huge*. In fact, business markets involve far more dollars and items than do consumer markets. For example, think about the large number of business transactions involved in the production and sale of a single set of Goodyear tires. Various suppliers sell Goodyear the rubber, steel, equipment, and other goods that it needs to produce tires. Goodyear then sells the finished tires to retailers, which in turn sell them to consumers. Thus, many sets of *business* purchases were made for only one set of *consumer* purchases. In addition, Goodyear sells tires as original equipment to manufacturers that install them on new vehicles and as replacement tires to companies that maintain their own fleets of company cars, trucks, or other vehicles.
