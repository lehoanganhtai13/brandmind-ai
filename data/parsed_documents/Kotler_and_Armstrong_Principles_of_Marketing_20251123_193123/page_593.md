# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### China’s Great Firewall

China has emerged as an enormous social media market. With more than 1.35 billion people and 635 million internet users, internet usage in China is growing explosively at about 30 percent annually. That makes it an extremely attractive market for Western social media companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube. However, under what has come to be called the “Great Firewall of China”—an extensive level of control and censorship of websites and internet activities by the Chinese government—many such Western social media and other online marketers have been largely blocked from operating in China. According to *The Diplomat*, eight of the top 25 most-visited global sites are now blocked in China. However, even with constant government monitoring of internet activities, China has become one of the world’s most active social media environments. Chinese consumers can connect through carefully controlled local social networking platforms such as Renren (everyone’s website), Baidu (Google-like search engine), Youku (China’s answer to YouTube), WeChat (Tencent’s instant messaging app), Jiepang (similar to Foursquare), microblogging sites such as Sina Weibo (like Twitter), and Dianping (similar to Yelp).

As more marketers enter the social media landscape in China, strategies to reach consumers must be carefully shaped to the country’s culture, consumers, content, platforms, and regulations. Online marketers must understand Chinese culture, translations, and etiquette to help craft better messages and marketing content that will resonate with Chinese consumers. At the same time, they must navigate under the watchful eye of the Chinese government.

- **19-9** Research the Great Firewall of China. How will such government control affect social media marketing in China? Report on a Western online company now operating in China. How is it able to work within and around Chinese regulations? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  
- **19-10** Suppose that your company is preparing to enter the Chinese market with a product line that you believe will have great success. What is the best mode of entry for your company? Review the economic and political climates. Is the timing right for entering China? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking) By 2020, the Chinese pharmaceutical market will be worth $1.3 trillion per year.
