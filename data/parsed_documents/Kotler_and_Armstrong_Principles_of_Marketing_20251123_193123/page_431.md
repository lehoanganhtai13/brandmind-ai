Lowe's is the second largest home improvement retailer in the world and in the business of providing 'how to' tips. When Vine launched earlier this year, we saw an opportunity. Using stop-motion techniques and the Vine application, we animated a dozen entertaining, useful six second videos. In the first campaign of its kind, we used the Vine platform as a way to bring useful tips to life. The campaign was recognized by the press and users alike for breaking meaning into a platform often associated with teen communities, rather than compelling content. Never Stop Improving

clout of big-budget traditional media with the power of social media to create personalized, real-time customer engagement.  
To be sure, Lowe’s runs a full slate of big-budget television spots and other traditional media ads that drive home its “Never Stop Improving” positioning. But in recent years, the company has added a rich flow of engaging, carefully integrated social media content that personalizes and enriches the Lowe’s customer experience in ways that traditional media can’t. Just one example is the Lowe’s “Fix in Six” Vine video campaign.  
**“Fix in Six”** features dozens of clever six-second looping videos showing quick-fix solutions to home-improvement problems—everything from removing stripped screws to keeping squirrels away from plants. The award-winning series was a huge success from the start, generating 28,000 social media mentions within just the first week and earning millions of total campaign impressions to date.  

Beyond Vine, the Lowe’s “Never Stop Improving” campaign integrates a broad mix of social media, each playing its own unique role. Lowe’s uses its heavily subscribed YouTube channel for longer DIY video tips and tutorials to supplement the quick hits on Vine. It uses Pinterest and Instagram to bring customers’ projects to life through high-impact imagery. Facebook provides a platform for engaging customers in dialogue—every Facebook comment gets an answer. Twitter serves for posting short comments or spreading the word about special offers. No matter what the platform, all content—from television spots to online videos to Facebook posts—is carefully coordinated under Lowe’s “Never Stop Improving” mantra and its mission of helping customers find home-improvement solutions. According to one Lowe’s marketer, the integrated marketing campaign is less about making the cash register ring and more about “making sure that customers . . . know that Lowe’s is offering them value and [about keeping them] engaged with the brand.”  

In the past, no one person or department was responsible for thinking through the communication roles of the various promotion tools and coordinating the promotion mix. To help implement integrated marketing communications, some companies have appointed a marketing communications director who has overall responsibility for the company’s communications efforts. This helps to produce better communications consistency and greater sales impact. It places the responsibility in someone’s hands—where none existed before—to unify the company’s image as it is shaped by thousands of company activities.

### Developing Effective Marketing Communication

> **Author Comment:** To develop effective marketing communications, you must first understand the general communication process.

#### A View of the Communication Process

Integrated marketing communications involves identifying the target audience and shaping a well-coordinated promotional program to obtain the desired audience response. Too often, marketing communications focus on immediate awareness, image, or preference goals in the target market. But this approach to communication is too shortsighted. Today, marketers are moving toward viewing communications as managing ongoing customer engagement and relationships with the company and its brands.  

Because customers differ, communications programs need to be developed for specific segments, niches, and even individuals. And, given today’s interactive communications technologies, companies must ask not only “How can we engage our customers?” but also “How can we let our customers engage us?”  

Thus, the communications process should start with an audit of all the potential touch points that target customers may have with the company and its brands. For example, someone purchasing a new wireless phone plan may talk to others, see television or magazine ads, visit various online sites for prices and reviews, and check out plans at Best Buy, Walmart, or a wireless provider’s kiosk or store. The marketer needs to assess what influence each communication experience will have at different stages of the buying.
