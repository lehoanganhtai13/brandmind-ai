# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This table outlines five key learning objectives related to marketing channels and supply chain management. It begins with an objective to explain the purpose and functions of marketing channels, introducing the concepts of Supply Chains and the Value Delivery Network. The subsequent objectives delve into the dynamics of channel member interactions and organization, followed by identifying available channel alternatives. The table then addresses the critical aspects of managing channel members, specifically their selection, motivation, and evaluation. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of Marketing Logistics and integrated Supply Chain Management. The structure progresses from foundational understanding to practical application and strategic management within the marketing channel framework.

Uber-mania is even catching on in other industries. It seems like there’s an app-based on-demand “Uber” for almost anything these days—laundry and dry cleaning (Washio), in-home massage (Zeel), 24/7 delivery services (Postmates), and even booze (Minibar). In fact, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick sees no end of future applications for Uber’s services, well beyond just delivering people to their destinations. Once Uber has established a dense network of cars in every city, he predicts using the network to deliver everything from packages from retailers to takeout food. As Kalanick puts it, “Once you’re delivering cars in five minutes, there are a lot of other things you can deliver in five minutes.”[^1]

> **AS THE UBER STORY SHOWS,** good distribution strategies can contribute strongly to customer value and create competitive advantage for a firm. But firms cannot bring value to customers by themselves. Instead, they must work closely with other firms in a larger value delivery network.

> **Author Comment:** These are pretty hefty terms for a really simple concept: A company can’t go it alone in creating customer value. It must work within a broader network of partners to accomplish this task. Individual companies and brands don’t compete; their entire value delivery networks do.

# Supply Chains and the Value Delivery Network

Producing a product or service and making it available to buyers requires building relationships not only with customers but also with key suppliers and resellers in the company’s *supply chain*. This supply chain consists of upstream and downstream partners. Upstream from the company is the set of firms that supply the raw materials, components, parts, information, finances, and expertise needed to create a product or service. Marketers, however, have traditionally focused on the downstream side of the supply chain—the *marketing channels* (or *distribution channels*) that look toward the customer. Downstream marketing channel partners, such as wholesalers and retailers, form a vital link between the firm and its customers.

The term *supply chain* may be too limited, as it takes a *make-and-sell* view of the business. It suggests that raw materials, productive inputs, and factory capacity should serve as the starting point for market planning. A better term would be *demand chain* because it A network composed of the company, suppliers, distributors, and, ultimately, customers who partner with each other to improve the performance of the entire system in delivering customer value.
