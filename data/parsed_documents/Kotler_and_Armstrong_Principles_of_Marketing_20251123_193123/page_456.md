# 15.1 Lenovo: Taking the Big Players Head-on

The tough competition in the smartphone market has produced some great advertising campaigns over the last decade. The intense rivalry in the segment has pushed the companies and their advertisers to look for innovative creative concepts, develop persuasive messages, use multiple media, execute interesting styles, and engage audiences in more ways than one.

For a long while, Apple had been the undisputed leader in the smartphone segment, but once Samsung, the South Korean electronics company, began challenging Apple’s leadership position, the advertising world saw some very interesting comparative advertising campaigns that became the industry’s must-see spectacles. Comparative advertising uses direct or indirect comparisons of a brand with a competitor’s brand. Direct comparative advertisements compare a brand specifically to another brand, whereas indirect comparative advertising points subtly to the competing brand by comparing their claims rather than the product directly. Based on a study, more than one-third of advertising is comparative in nature, while roughly one-fourth of advertising directly identifies competing brands.

One of Samsung’s most aggressive comparative advertising campaigns was for the launch of its Galaxy S Series in 2012. Claiming that the next “Big Thing” was already available, it was a direct attack on Apple, which was launching the iPhone 5 in that year. In its ad, Samsung successfully highlighted the features that were important to smartphone users but were not well served by Apple. The ad effectively used humor and mockery to downplay some of the Apple brand’s key aspects while avoiding Apple’s name and logo. The humor helped soften Samsung’s battering of the Apple product so viewers would still feel positive about the former. The strategy worked well for Samsung: it managed to keep the emphasis on its brand without deflecting the audience’s attention toward Apple.

Since 2012, Samsung has been the global smartphone market leader, with a 20 to 30 percent market share, and Apple has consistently been its closest rival. The two giants are followed by Chinese brands like Huawei, Lenovo, OPPO Electronics Corp, and Vivo. The year 2016 signaled the maturity stage in the smartphone industry as the sales growth flattened in many markets around the world. This was mainly due to a decline in developed markets such as United States, Canada, Japan, and Western Europe. In China, there was a mature growth pattern alongside the rise of new value players. In 2016 Apple’s revenues fell by 18 percent—its first revenue decline in 13 years. Nonetheless, Apple and Samsung continued to enjoy their brand popularity and there was high anticipation and excitement about the release of Apple iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7, and Galaxy Note 7.

In the third quarter of 2016, Lenovo made a surprisingly aggressive move. In an effort to challenge the hype surrounding the unveiling of its competitor’s seventh smartphone versions, Lenovo launched its “Skip the Sevens” advertising campaign. Lenovo had bought Motorola from Google in 2014 and in September 2016 decided to competitively position and promote its Moto Z smartphone against Samsung and Apple with the Skip the Sevens campaign. Lenovo’s promotional attack came weeks after Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, while Samsung was still dealing with the worldwide recall of its Galaxy Note 7 handsets after reports of their batteries exploding.

Poking fun at the market leaders, Lenovo adopted the comparative advertising approach to persuade Apple and Samsung users to switch to the Lenovo Moto Z. Its ad creatively challenged leaders to deliver meaningful innovation, implying that smartphone innovation had stalled because it mostly relied on these two brands. The ad says that Apple and Samsung focused only on incremental product improvements like increasing the screen display size and changing the camera by few mega pixels; consumers had to wait two years or more for the next “big thing.”

Lenovo’s campaign kicked off with a full-page print and digital ad and a 2-minute-long YouTube video. In the campaign, Lenovo introduced the key features of Moto Z as Moto Mods, which use a modular design that enables users to convert their phones into the devices they want, when they want. Users can thus choose a better camera, speaker, or projector through snap-on cases. The campaign also emphasized the phone’s enhanced battery life compared to other smartphones. In its print advert, Lenovo used a creative comparative approach by acknowledging iPhone’s revolutionary place in technological advances but quickly pointed out

Apple and Samsung have used comparative advertising against each other successfully, but Lenovo has taken on both smartphone giants with its own campaign.
