## FIGURE 2.7  
**SWOT Analysis: Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O), and Threats (T)**

This table outlines the four components of a SWOT analysis, a strategic planning framework. It categorizes factors as either internal or external to an organization, and as either positive or negative in their impact. Internal strengths represent capabilities that aid in achieving objectives, while internal weaknesses are limitations that hinder objective achievement. External opportunities are factors the company can leverage for advantage, whereas external threats are current or emerging factors that challenge performance. The framework thus provides a structured approach to assessing both an organization's internal resources and the external environment to inform strategic decision-making.

> The goal of SWOT analysis is to match the company’s strengths to attractive opportunities in the environment while eliminating or overcoming the weaknesses and minimizing the threats.

> Hang on to this figure! SWOT analysis (pronounced “swat” analysis) is a widely used tool for conducting a situation analysis. You’ll find yourself using it a lot in the future, especially when analyzing business cases.

which it evaluates the company’s overall strengths (S), weaknesses (W), opportunities (O), and threats (T) (see **Figure 2.7**). Strengths include internal capabilities, resources, and positive situational factors that may help the company serve its customers and achieve its objectives. Weaknesses include internal limitations and negative situational factors that may interfere with the company’s performance. Opportunities are favorable factors or trends in the external environment that the company may be able to exploit to its advantage. And threats are unfavorable external factors or trends that may present challenges to performance.

The company should analyze its markets and marketing environment to find attractive opportunities and identify threats. It should analyze company strengths and weaknesses as well as current and possible marketing actions to determine which opportunities it can best pursue. The goal is to match the company’s strengths to attractive opportunities in the environment while simultaneously eliminating or overcoming the weaknesses and minimizing the threats. Marketing analysis provides inputs to each of the other marketing management functions. We discuss marketing analysis more fully in Chapter 3.

## Marketing Planning

Through strategic planning, the company decides what it wants to do with each business unit. Marketing planning involves choosing marketing strategies that will help the company attain its overall strategic objectives. A detailed marketing plan is needed for each business, product, or brand. What does a marketing plan look like? Our discussion focuses on product or brand marketing plans.

**Table 2.2** outlines the major sections of a typical product or brand marketing plan. (See Appendix 1 for a sample marketing plan.) The plan begins with an executive summary that quickly reviews major assessments, goals, and recommendations. The main section of the plan presents a detailed SWOT analysis of the current marketing situation as well as potential threats and opportunities. The plan next states major objectives for the brand and outlines the specifics of a marketing strategy for achieving them.

A *marketing strategy* consists of specific strategies for target markets, positioning, the marketing mix, and marketing expenditure levels. It outlines how the company intends to engage target customers and create value in order to capture value in return. In this section, the planner explains how each strategy responds to the threats, opportunities, and critical issues spelled out earlier in the plan. Additional sections of the marketing plan lay out an *action program* for implementing the marketing strategy along with the details of a supporting *marketing budget*. The last section outlines the *controls* that will be used to monitor progress, measure return on marketing investment, and take corrective action.

## Marketing Implementation

Planning good strategies is only a start toward successful marketing. A brilliant marketing strategy counts for little if the company fails to implement it properly. **Marketing implementation** is the process that turns marketing *plans* into marketing *actions* to accomplish Presents a brief summary of the main goals and recommendations of the plan for management review, helping top management find the plan’s major points quickly.
