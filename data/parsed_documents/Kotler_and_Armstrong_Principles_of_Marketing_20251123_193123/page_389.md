# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

That took longer than the traditional swipe of the card, even if everything worked as intended.

With Apple Pay, users still need to configure the app. But Apple entered the digital wallet business with 800 million credit cards already on file within its existing iTunes store. Not only can this facilitate a setup that is already streamlined compared with existing apps, it’s a sign that iTunes users may be more comfortable with using the app given that they have already given their credit card information to Apple. And with the TouchID sensor, Apple has the transaction down to a one-touch process. That’s quicker than swiping a card and going through the typical menu, not to mention quicker than inputting a passcode.

## Establishing Points of Acceptance

For mobile payments to penetrate the market, consumer acceptance is necessary. But companies face a twofold challenge in making such a technology successful. Consumers won’t adopt it if retailers don’t accept it, and retailers won’t invest the resources necessary to accept it unless there is sufficient consumer demand. And the lack of consumer demand is the biggest factor that has kept retailers from jumping onto the mobile payments bandwagon. As a result, having too few retailers accept mobile payments was a barrier to convincing people to leave their credit cards at home.

But thanks to Apple that situation is changing rapidly. It may be because of Apple’s clout or because of its massive and loyal user base. But in less than a year, Apple signed up far more retailers than all the previous mobile payment providers combined. Today, more than 2.5 million contactless-enabled terminals in the United States accept Apple Pay, a level that demonstrates the type of momentum that will keep Apple on a growth trajectory. “You need so many points of acceptance to make mobile payments work,” says a mobile payments analyst for Forrester Research. “Apple has made that happen, striking partnerships with top national brands across a variety of categories that will give consumers plenty of opportunity to use the service.” Apple has also signed up enough credit card–issuing banks and credit unions to cover the vast majority of charge volume.

Given the tremendous potential for this market, the competition has been very active. Google has pulled back on Google Wallet, even as it has released a more user-friendly and more widely accepted Android Pay. PayPal has the advantage of its massive online payments network as well as the first-mover advantage. Samsung intends for Samsung Pay to be a fluid component for its foray into the Internet of Things. Banks such as Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are intent on keeping payment transactions in the banking business with apps of their own. And numerous startups are pushing digital wallet apps, including Coin, eWallet, Gyft, KeyRing, and LevelUp. What’s more, most of these digital wallets utilize the contactless-reader technologies that are already part of existing point-of-sale terminals, eliminating retailer acceptance as a barrier to entry.

In addition to the competition, Apple still faces other challenges. For starters, while Apple’s market penetration far exceeds that of the competition and continues to grow by a million new users each week, the mobile payments leader has a long way to go before reaching critical mass as digital wallets are still being used for only a sliver of all retail transactions. Additionally, the complexity of the payments industry has required Apple and other companies to focus on developing one system. And with everything from smartwatches to refrigerators now featuring payment capabilities, changes in consumer payment behaviors are inevitable. In an environment as volatile as this one, an alternative technology could certainly upset the apple cart.

Still, Apple remains confident. With in-browser and peer-to-peer payments on the horizon, there is more potential than ever to boost transactions. And don’t count out an Apple Pay app for Android devices. In short, experts predict that this year will be a watershed one for the payments industry. Although there are still plenty of doubters that mobile payments will replace plastic as the go-to method for purchasing goods and services, there are also plenty of believers. And although Apple is clearly ahead at this point, its success also bodes well for the competition. As the concept catches on and technologies become more compatible, demand among non-Apple users will increase as well.
