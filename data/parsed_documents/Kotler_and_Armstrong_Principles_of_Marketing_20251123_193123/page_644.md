# Chain ratio method

A variation of this approach is the **chain ratio method**. This method involves multiplying a base number by a chain of adjusting percentages. For example, HD’s product is designed to stream high-definition video on high-definition televisions as well as play other video content streamed from the internet to multiple devices in a home. Thus, consumers who do not own a high-definition television will not likely purchase this player. Additionally, only households with broadband internet access will be able to use the product. Finally, not all HDTV-owning internet households will be willing and able to purchase this product. HD can estimate U.S. demand using a chain of calculations like the following:

$$
\text{Total number of U.S. households} \times \\
\text{The percentage of HDTV-owning U.S. households with broadband internet access} \times \\
\text{The percentage of these households willing and able to buy this device}
$$

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are approximately 115 million households in the United States. HD’s research indicates that 60 percent of U.S. households own at least one HDTV and have broadband internet access. Finally, the company’s research also revealed that 30 percent of households possess the discretionary income needed and are willing to buy a product such as this. Then the total number of households willing and able to purchase this product is:

$$
115 \text{ million households} \times 0.60 \times 0.30 = 20.7 \text{ million households}
$$

Households only need to purchase one device because it can stream content to other devices throughout the household. Assuming the average retail price across all brands is $350 for this product, the estimate of total market demand is as follows:

$$
20.7 \text{ million households} \times 1 \text{ device per household} \times 350 = 7,245,000,000
$$

This simple chain of calculations gives HD only a rough estimate of potential demand. However, more detailed chains involving additional segments and other qualifying factors would yield more accurate and refined estimates. Still, these are only *estimates* of market potential. They rely heavily on assumptions regarding adjusting percentages, average quantity, and average price. Thus, HD must make certain that its assumptions are reasonable and defendable. As can be seen, the overall market potential in dollar sales can vary widely given the average price used. For this reason, HD will use unit sales potential to determine its sales estimate for next year. Market potential in terms of units is 20.7 million (20.7 million households × 1 device per household).

Assuming that HD forecasts it will have a 3.6% market share in the first year after launching this product, then it can forecast unit sales at

$$
20.7 \text{ million units} \times 0.036 = 745,200 \text{ units}
$$

At a selling price of $168 per unit, this translates into sales of

$$
125,193,600 \quad (745,200 \text{ units} \times 168 \text{ per unit})
$$

For simplicity, further analyses will use forecasted sales of $125 million.

This unit volume estimate is well within HD’s production capacity and exceeds not only the break-even estimate (465,117 units) calculated earlier but also the volume necessary to realize a $5 million profit (581,396 units) or a 30% return on investment (534,884 units). However, this forecast falls well short of the volume necessary to realize a 25% return on sales (20 million units!) and may require that HD revise expectations.

To assess expected profits, we must now look at the budgeted expenses for launching this product. To do this, we will construct a pro forma profit-and-loss statement.

# The Profit-and-Loss Statement and Marketing Budget

All marketing managers must account for the profit impact of their marketing strategies. A major tool for projecting such profit impact is a **pro forma** (or **projected**) **profit-and-loss statement** (also called an **income statement** or **operating statement**). A pro forma statement shows projected revenues less budgeted expenses and estimates the projected net profit for an organization, product, or brand during a specific planning period, typically a year. It includes direct product production costs, marketing expenses budgeted to attain a given sales forecast, and overhead expenses assigned to the organization or product. A profit-and-loss statement typically consists of several major components (see **Table A2.1**):

* **Net sales** — gross sales revenue minus returns and allowances (for example, trade, cash, quantity, and promotion allowances). HD’s net sales for 2017 are estimated to be $125 million, as determined in the previous analysis.
