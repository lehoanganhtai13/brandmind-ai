# Table 13.3 | Major Types of Wholesalers

This table outlines two primary types of intermediaries: Merchant Wholesalers and Brokers and Agents, distinguished by whether they take title to merchandise. Merchant wholesalers, which are independently owned and take title, are further divided into full-service and limited-service categories. Full-service wholesalers offer a comprehensive suite of services including stock carrying, sales force maintenance, credit, delivery, and management assistance, encompassing wholesale merchants (selling to retailers) and industrial distributors (selling to manufacturers). Limited-service wholesalers provide fewer services and include types such as cash-and-carry, truck, drop shippers, rack jobbers, producers' cooperatives, and mail-order/web wholesalers. Brokers and agents, conversely, do not take title to goods; their primary role is to facilitate transactions for a commission. Brokers bring buyers and sellers together for negotiation, while agents represent buyers or sellers more permanently, with specific types including manufacturers' agents and selling agents who manage a manufacturer's sales. ----
