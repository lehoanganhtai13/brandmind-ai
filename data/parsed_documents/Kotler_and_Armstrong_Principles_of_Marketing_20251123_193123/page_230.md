# Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

stop improving.” And IKEA does more than just sell affordable home furnishings; it’s the “Life improvement store.”

Consumers are overloaded with information about products and services. They cannot reevaluate products every time they make a buying decision. To simplify the buying process, consumers organize products, services, and companies into categories and “position” them in their minds. A product’s position is the complex set of perceptions, impressions, and feelings that consumers have for the product compared with competing products.

Consumers position products with or without the help of marketers. But marketers do not want to leave their products’ positions to chance. They must **plan** positions that will give their products the greatest advantage in selected target markets, and they must design marketing mixes to create these planned positions.

## Positioning Maps

In planning their differentiation and positioning strategies, marketers often prepare *perceptual positioning maps* that show consumer perceptions of their brands versus those of competing products on important buying dimensions. **Figure 7.3** shows a positioning map for the U.S. large luxury SUV market. The position of each circle on the map indicates the brand’s perceived positioning on two dimensions: price and orientation (luxury versus performance). The size of each circle indicates the brand’s relative market share.

Thus, customers view the market-leading Cadillac Escalade as a moderately priced, large, luxury SUV with a balance of luxury and performance. The Escalade is positioned on urban luxury, and in its case, “performance” probably means power and safety performance. You’ll find no mention of off-road adventuring in an Escalade ad.

By contrast, the Range Rover and the Land Cruiser are positioned on luxury with nuances of off-road performance. For example, the Toyota Land Cruiser began in 1951 as a four-wheel-drive, jeep-like vehicle designed to conquer the world’s most grueling terrains and climates. In recent years, the Land Cruiser has retained this adventure and performance positioning but with luxury added. Its website brags of “legendary off-road capability,” with off-road technologies such as an Acoustic Control Induction System to get the most out of the RPMs, “so you can make molehills out of mountains.” Despite its ruggedness, however, the company notes that “its Bluetooth hands-free technology, DVD entertainment, and a sumptuous interior have softened its edges.”

This figure presents a positioning map for large luxury SUVs, illustrating how consumers perceive brands based on two key dimensions: price (on the y-axis, in thousands of dollars) and luxury-performance orientation (implied on the x-axis, though not explicitly labeled). Brands are represented by circles, with their position indicating their perceived standing on these attributes. The size of each circle signifies the brand's relative market share within this segment. For instance, the Cadillac Escalade is positioned at a high price point and likely high on the luxury-performance scale, while the Infiniti QX and Lexus LX570 are also in a high-price, high-luxury-performance area. The Toyota Land Cruiser is depicted as a niche brand, perceived as relatively expensive and more performance-oriented, with a smaller market share indicated by its circle size. Other brands like the Lincoln Navigator, Land Rover Range Rover, and Toyota Land Cruiser are mapped according to their respective consumer perceptions of price and luxury-performance. Some firms find it easy to choose a differentiation and positioning strategy.
