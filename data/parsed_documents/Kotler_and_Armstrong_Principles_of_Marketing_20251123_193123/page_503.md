* Toyota Cooling Zones: During festivals, Toyota offers cooling zones with drinks and snacks as well as the chance to hang out with the vehicles.  
* Test Drives: These are regular auto marketing fare, but Toyota makes them more fun. For example, at the Stagecoach festival, attendees could take Toyota trucks off-road on ramps, logs, and other fun things to experience the vehicle’s drive and maneuvers.  
* Music Bloggers and Influencers: Toyota collaborates with popular music bloggers and influencers by inviting them to music festivals and creating real-time content for both their social channels.  
* Offer a Unique Creative Presence. Toyota uses such festivals to give attendees something to really remember. Some examples include developing storybook-inspired, larger-than-life neon-colored scenery, playing Skee-Ball in the back of a Toyota RAV4, and decorating a Toyota Camry.  
* Provide an Opportunity to Meet Product Specialists. Toyota hopes that after festival goers have interacted with the brand in fun ways, they will be more interested in checking out its vehicles (with the help of a product specialist). People can thus experience its vehicles outside a dealership environment.  
* Develop a Customer Data Base. The music festival attendees can choose to accept emails and the festival entertainment newsletter. If the attendees are looking to buy a car, they can also ask to be contacted by a dealer.  
* Selling without a Pitch. Toyota says that it views these festivals as an alternative, fun way of bringing the car to potential customers outside the retailer and the dealership environment. This helps to connect the brand with the consumers without any sales pressure.

Personal selling as a promotional tool is declining in popularity, but Toyota’s music festival strategy effectively provides an alternative way of bringing cars to prospective customers and engaging with them.

# Business Promotions

Companies spend billions of dollars each year on promotion geared toward industrial customers. **Business promotions** are used to generate business leads, stimulate purchases, reward customers, and motivate salespeople. Business promotions include many of the same tools used for consumer or trade promotions. Here, we focus on two additional major business promotion tools: conventions and trade shows and sales contests.

Many companies and trade associations organize *conventions and trade shows* to promote their products. Firms selling to the industry show their products at the trade show. Vendors at these shows receive many benefits, such as opportunities to find new sales leads, contact customers, introduce new products, meet new customers, sell more to present customers, and educate customers with publications and audiovisual materials. Trade shows also help companies reach many prospects that are not reached through their sales forces.

Some trade shows are huge. For example, at this year’s International Consumer Electronics Show, more than 3,600 exhibitors attracted some 170,000 professional visitors.  
🔵 Even more impressive, at the Bauma mining and construction equipment trade show in Munich, Germany, more than 3,400 exhibitors from 57 countries presented their latest product innovations to more than 530,000 attendees from more than 200 countries. Total exhibition space equaled about 6.1 million square feet (more than 127 football fields).  

A *sales contest* is a contest for salespeople or dealers to motivate them to increase their sales performance over a given period. Sales contests motivate and recognize good company performers, who may receive trips, cash prizes, or other gifts. Some companies award points for performance, which the receiver can turn in for any of a variety of prizes. Sales contests work best when they are tied to measurable and achievable sales objectives (such as finding new accounts, reviving old accounts, or increasing account profitability).

# Developing the Sales Promotion Program

Beyond selecting the types of promotions to use, marketers must make several other decisions in designing the full sales promotion program. First, they must determine the *size of the incentive*. A certain minimum incentive **Business promotions**
