# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Associated with these programs makes them very popular among the staff. In this existing arrangement, a staff member can attend paper-based training programs, online training opportunities, and video-based programs. In 2013, HSBC employees collectively received a total of 988,000 days of online and face-to-face training—equivalent to almost four days per full-time employee.

The ultimate aim of the bank is to ensure enduring job satisfaction among the staff, as the management sees this as a worthwhile investment. It is not surprising that the bank was named one of the top employers in the United Kingdom for women in The Times Top 50 Employers for Women in 2015. Antonio Simoes, Chief Executive of HSBC Bank plc, who heads the United Kingdom and Continental Europe since September 2015, emphasizes the bank’s values in relation to its offer of equal employment opportunities to different kinds of men and women, reflective of the company’s own diverse customer base and its commitment to gender balance.

From the outset, the bank’s staff is able to develop their own professional networks with clients and colleagues around the world. They may also have the opportunity to develop their skills and gain experience in another country through one of HSBC’s international assignments, which typically range in length from three months to three years. The HSBC International Management Programme offers employees the chance to pursue an internationally mobile career in a variety of roles and locations.

Another key feature of the bank’s internal marketing program is its flexible benefit packages for employees. Besides the competitive regular payments it offers its staff, HSBC’s overtime payment is very attractive. In response to the views of employees, the bank tailors its benefits packages to the specific needs of the staff. For example, benefits can be customized to employees’ interests in providing for the future, breakdown coverage, and childcare, among other options. The bank simply calls this “My Choice.” Employees may also make income tax and National Insurance savings on certain benefits. So, to those who wonder why HSBC’s staff members are so customer-focused—always welcoming customers with smiles and courtesy, and strongly committed to the business of satisfying customers—the key answers lie in the employees’ motivation levels, morale, and career development paths embedded in the bank’s internal marketing program. HSBC has proven that winning in a tough marketplace is not only about formulating a sound marketing strategy, but also about taking care of those who take care of its customers.

Only people with an innate “passion to serve” and instructs them carefully in the fine art of interacting with customers to satisfy their every need. All new hires—at all levels of the company—complete a four-week customer-loyalty training regimen.

Today, as competition and costs increase and as productivity and quality decrease, more services marketing sophistication is needed. Service companies face three major marketing tasks: They want to increase their *service differentiation*, *service quality*, and *service productivity*.

## Managing Service Differentiation

In these days of intense price competition, service marketers often complain about the difficulty of differentiating their services from those of competitors. To the extent that customers view the services of different providers as similar, they care less about the provider than the price. The solution to price competition is to develop a differentiated offer, delivery, and image.

The *offer* can include innovative features that set one company’s offer apart from competitors’ offers. For example, some retailers differentiate themselves with offerings that take you well beyond the products they stock. Apple’s highly successful stores offer a Genius Bar for technical support and a host of free workshops on everything from iPhone, iPad, and Mac basics to the intricacies of using iMovie to turn home movies into blockbusters.
