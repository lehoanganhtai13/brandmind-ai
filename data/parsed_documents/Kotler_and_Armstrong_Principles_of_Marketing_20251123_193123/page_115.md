and alternative medicines. These consumers make up a sizable and growing market. For example, food producers have also found fast-growing markets for natural and organic products. In total, the U.S. organic/natural food market now generates $45 billion in annual retail sales and will grow to an estimated $200 billion by 2019.⁴⁸

Annie’s Homegrown, a General Mills company, caters to this market with sustainable, all-natural food products—from mac and cheese to pizzas, pastas, snacks, and salad dressings—made and sold in a sustainable way:⁴⁹

> Annie’s is out to create a happier and healthier world with nourishing foods and responsible conduct that is “forever kind to the planet.” Annie’s products are made from simple, natural ingredients grown by its farm partners. The products contain “no artificial anything,” says the company. “If it’s not real, it’s not Annie’s.” The company works closely with its food supply-system partners to jointly raise the bar for sustainability and organics. Annie’s also makes sustainable practices a top priority with its packaging—more than 90 percent of Annie’s packaging by weight is recyclable. Finally, Annie’s gives back to the community through programs such as sustainable agriculture scholarships, school garden programs, and support for like-minded organizations dedicated to making the planet a better place to live and eat.

### People’s Views of the Universe

Finally, people vary in their beliefs about the origins of the universe and their place in it. Although most Americans practice religion, religious conviction and practice have been dropping off gradually through the years. According to a recent poll, 22 percent of Americans now say they are not affiliated with any particular faith, up from about 17 percent just seven years prior. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, more than one-third say they are not currently affiliated with any particular religion.⁵⁰

However, the fact that people are dropping out of organized religion doesn’t mean that they are abandoning their faith. Some futurists have noted a renewed interest in spirituality, perhaps as a part of a broader search for a new inner purpose. People have been moving away from materialism and dog-eat-dog ambition to seek more permanent values—family, community, earth, faith—and a more certain grasp of right and wrong. Rather than calling it “religion,” they call it “spirituality.” One recent survey found that whereas Americans have become less religious in recent years, the share of people who feel a deep sense of “spiritual peace and well-being” as well as a deep sense of “wonder about the universe” has risen.⁵¹ This changing spiritualism affects consumers in everything from the television shows they watch and the books they read to the products and services they buy.

> **Author Comment:** Rather than simply watching and reacting to the marketing environment, companies should take proactive steps.

### Responding to the Marketing Environment

Someone once observed, “There are three kinds of companies: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what’s happened.” Many companies view the marketing environment as an uncontrollable element to which they must react and adapt. They passively accept the marketing environment and do not try to change it. They analyze environmental forces and design strategies that will help the company avoid the threats and take advantage of the opportunities the environment provides.

Other companies take a *proactive* stance toward the marketing environment. Rather than assuming that strategic options are bounded by the current environment, these firms develop strategies to change the environment. Companies and their products often create and shape new industries and their structures, products such as Ford’s Model T car, Apple’s iPod and iPhone, Google’s search engine, and Amazon’s online marketplace.

Even more, rather than simply watching and reacting to environmental events, proactive firms take aggressive actions to affect the publics and forces in their marketing environment. Such companies hire lobbyists to influence legislation affecting their industries.
