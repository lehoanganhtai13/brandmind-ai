## Choosing Communication Channels and Media

The communicator must now select the *channels of communication*. There are two broad types of communication channels: *personal* and *nonpersonal*.

### Personal Communication Channels

In **personal communication channels**, two or more people communicate directly with each other. They might communicate face-to-face, on the phone, via mail or email, or even through texting or an internet chat. Personal communication channels are effective because they allow for personal addressing and feedback.

Some personal communication channels are controlled directly by the company. For example, company salespeople contact business buyers. But other personal communications about the product may reach buyers through channels not directly controlled by the company. These channels might include independent experts—consumer advocates, bloggers, and others—making statements to buyers. Or they might be neighbors, friends, family members, associates, or other consumers talking to target buyers, in person or via social media or other interactive media. This last channel, **word-of-mouth influence**, has considerable effect in many product areas.

Personal influence carries great weight, especially for products that are expensive, risky, or highly visible. One survey found that recommendations from friends and family are far and away the most powerful influence on consumers worldwide: More than 80 percent of consumers said friends and family are the number-one influence on their awareness and purchase. Another study found that 72 percent of consumers cited online reviews and trusted sources of buying information. Trust in ads ran from about 63 percent to only 36 percent, depending on the medium.  
Is it any wonder, then, that few consumers buy a big-ticket item before checking out what existing users have to say about the product at a site such as Amazon.com? Who hasn’t made an Amazon purchase based on another customer’s review or the “Customers who bought this also bought …” section or decided against purchase because of negative customer reviews?

Companies can take steps to put personal communication channels to work for them. For example, as we discussed in Chapter 5, they can create *opinion leaders* for their brands—people whose opinions are sought by others—by supplying influencers with the product on attractive terms or by educating them so that they can inform others. **Buzz marketing** involves cultivating opinion leaders and getting them to spread information about a product or a service to others in their communities. For example, Netflix recruits “Grammasters,” influencers who have large Instagram followings. The Grammasters travel around the world taking photos and creating video content of familiar sets and scenes from popular original Netflix shows and posting them to Instagram, letting Netflix bingers engage even more deeply with their favorite Netflix series.
