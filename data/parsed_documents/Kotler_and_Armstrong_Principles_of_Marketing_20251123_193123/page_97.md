# Customers

Suppose the company wants a specific response from a particular public, such as goodwill, favorable word of mouth and social sharing, or donations of time or money. The company would have to design an offer to this public that is attractive enough to produce the desired response.

Customers are the most important actors in the company’s microenvironment. The aim of the entire value delivery network is to engage target customers and create strong relationships with them. The company might target any or all of five types of customer markets. *Consumer markets* consist of individuals and households that buy goods and services for personal consumption. *Business markets* buy goods and services for further processing or use in their production processes, whereas *reseller markets* buy goods and services to resell at a profit. *Government markets* consist of government agencies that buy goods and services to produce public services or transfer the goods and services to others who need them. Finally, *international markets* consist of these buyers in other countries, including consumers, producers, resellers, and governments. Each market type has special characteristics that call for careful study by the seller.

> **Author Comment:** The macroenvironment consists of broader forces that affect the actors in the microenvironment.

## The Macroenvironment

The company and all of the other actors operate in a larger macroenvironment of forces that shape opportunities and pose threats to the company. **Figure 3.2** shows the six major forces in the company’s macroenvironment. Even the most dominant companies can be vulnerable to the often turbulent and changing forces in the marketing environment. Some of these forces are unforeseeable and uncontrollable. Others can be predicted and handled through skillful management. Companies that understand and adapt well to their environments can thrive. Those that don’t can face difficult times. One-time dominant market leaders such as Xerox, Sears, and Sony have learned this lesson the hard way. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we examine these forces and show how they affect marketing plans.

> **Author Comment:** Changes in demographics mean changes in markets, so they are very important to marketers. We first look at the biggest demographic trend—the changing age structure of the population.

## The Demographic and Economic Environments

### The Demographic Environment

**Demography** is the study of human populations in terms of size, density, location, age, gender, race, occupation, and other statistics. The demographic environment is of major interest to marketers because it involves people, and people make up markets. The world population is growing at an explosive rate. It now exceeds 7.3 billion people and is expected to grow to more than 8 billion by the year 2030. The world’s large and highly diverse population poses both opportunities and challenges.

Changes in the world demographic environment have major implications for business. Thus, marketers keep a close eye on demographic trends and developments in their

### Figure 3.2  
**Major Forces in the Company’s Macroenvironment**

This table outlines the six key external environmental factors that influence a company's operations and strategy. These factors are categorized as Demographic, Economic, Natural, Technological, Political, and Cultural. Each category represents a distinct area of external influence that companies must monitor and adapt to. The structure is comparative, presenting these six environmental forces as distinct but interconnected elements that collectively shape the business landscape. Understanding and responding to changes within each of these domains is crucial for a company's strategic planning and long-term success.

> **Concern for the natural environment has spawned a so-called green movement. For example, Timberland is on a mission to develop products that do less harm to the environment.**

> **Changing demographics mean changes in markets and marketing strategies. For example, Netflix created a “Just for Kids” portal and app targeting today’s fast-growing young, tech-savvy “Gen Z” segment.**

> **Marketers also want to be socially responsible citizens in their markets and communities. For example, online eyewear seller Warby Parker was founded on a cause: For every pair of glasses Warby Parker sells, it distributes a free pair to someone in need.** The study of human populations in terms of size, density, location, age, gender, race, occupation, and other statistics.
