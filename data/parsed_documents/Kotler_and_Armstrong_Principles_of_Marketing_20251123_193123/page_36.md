# Choosing a Value Proposition

The company must also decide how it will serve targeted customers—how it will *differentiate* and *position* itself in the marketplace. A brand’s *value proposition* is the set of benefits or values it promises to deliver to consumers to satisfy their needs. JetBlue promises to put “You Above All” by bringing “humanity back to travel.” By contrast, Spirit Airlines gives you “Bare Fare” pricing: “Less Money. More Go.” Homewood Suites by Hilton wants you to “Make yourself at home.” ● Meanwhile, the Hyatt Regency brand declares that sometimes “It’s good not to be home.” Its ads highlight the joys of traveling and the fun things that people do when they are traveling on business.

Such value propositions differentiate one brand from another. They answer the customer’s question: “Why should I buy your brand rather than a competitor’s?” Companies must design strong value propositions that give them the greatest advantage in their target markets.

### Marketing Management Orientations

Marketing management wants to design strategies that will engage target customers and build profitable relationships with them. But what *philosophy* should guide these marketing strategies? What weight should be given to the interests of customers, the organization, and society? Very often, these interests conflict.

There are five alternative concepts under which organizations design and carry out their marketing strategies: the *production*, *product*, *selling*, *marketing*, and *societal marketing* concepts.

### Production concept

The idea that consumers will favor products that are available and highly affordable; therefore, the organization should focus on improving production and distribution efficiency.

### The Production Concept

The *production concept* holds that consumers will favor products that are available and highly affordable. Therefore, management should focus on improving production and distribution efficiency. This concept is one of the oldest orientations that guides sellers.

The production concept is still a useful philosophy in some situations. For example, both personal computer maker Lenovo and home appliance maker Haier dominate the highly competitive, price-sensitive Chinese market through low labor costs, high production efficiency, and mass distribution. However, although useful in some situations, the production concept can lead to marketing myopia. Companies adopting this orientation run a major risk of focusing too narrowly on their own operations and losing sight of the real objective—satisfying customer needs and building customer relationships.

### Product concept

The idea that consumers will favor products that offer the most quality, performance, and features; therefore, the organization should devote its energy to making continuous product improvements.

### The Product Concept

The *product concept* holds that consumers will favor products that offer the most in quality, performance, and innovative features. Under this concept, marketing strategy focuses on making continuous product improvements.

Product quality and improvement are important parts of most marketing strategies. However, focusing *only* on the company’s products can also lead to marketing myopia. For example, some manufacturers believe that if they can “build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to their doors.” But they are often rudely shocked. Buyers may be looking for a better solution to a mouse problem but not necessarily for a better mousetrap. The better solution might be a chemical spray, an exterminating service, a house cat, or something else that suits their needs even better than a mousetrap. Furthermore, a better mousetrap will not sell unless the manufacturer designs, packages, and prices it attractively; places it in convenient distribution channels; brings it to the attention of people who need it; and convinces buyers that it is a better product.
