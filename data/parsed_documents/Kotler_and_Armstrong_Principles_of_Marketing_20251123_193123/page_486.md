# Team Selling and Recruiting Salespeople

Then buyers routinely use the phone, online meetings, and social media interactions to engage sellers and close deals. “With virtual meeting software such as GoToMeeting.com and WebEx, communications tools such as Skype, and social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, it’s become easier to sell with few if any face-to-face meetings,” says an inside sales consultant.⁶

As a result of these trends, telephone and online selling are growing much faster than in-person selling. One recent study found that inside sales positions are growing 300 times faster than outside sales positions. Another study also notes the emergence of the “hybrid sales rep,” a modern cross between a field sales rep and an inside rep who often works from a remote location. Some 41 percent of outside sales activity is now done over the phone or a mobile device, from a home office or a company office or on the go.⁷ For many types of products and selling situations, phone or online selling can be as effective as a personal sales call.

## Team Selling

> **Team selling**  
> Using teams of people from sales, marketing, engineering, finance, technical support, and even upper management to service large, complex accounts.

As products become more complex and as customers grow larger and more demanding, a single salesperson simply can’t handle all of a large customer’s needs. Instead, most companies now use **team selling** to service large, complex accounts. Sales teams can unearth problems, solutions, and sales opportunities that no individual salesperson could. Such teams might include experts from any area or level of the selling firm—sales, marketing, technical and support services, research and development, engineering, operations, finance, and others.

In many cases, the move to team selling mirrors similar changes in customers’ buying organizations. Many large customer companies have implemented team-based purchasing, requiring marketers to employ equivalent team-based selling. When dealing with large, complex accounts, one salesperson can’t be an expert in everything the customer needs. Instead, selling is done by strategic account teams, quarterbacked by senior account managers or customer business managers.

For example, the P&G Walmart Customer Business Development team is a complete, multifunctional customer service unit consisting of more than 300 people. The team includes a CBD manager and several CBD account executives (each responsible for a specific P&G product category), supported by specialists in marketing strategy, product development, operations, information systems, logistics, finance, and human resources.

Team selling does have some pitfalls, however. For example, salespeople are by nature competitive and have often been trained and rewarded for outstanding individual performance. Salespeople who are used to having customers all to themselves may have trouble learning to work with and trust others on a team. In addition, selling teams can confuse or overwhelm customers who are used to working with only one salesperson. Finally, difficulties in evaluating individual contributions to the team-selling effort can create some sticky compensation issues.

## Recruiting and Selecting Salespeople

At the heart of any successful sales force operation is the recruitment and selection of good salespeople. The performance difference between an average salesperson and a top salesperson can be substantial. In a typical sales force, the top 30 percent of the salespeople might bring in 60 percent of the sales. Thus, careful salesperson selection can greatly increase overall sales force performance.

Beyond the differences in sales performance, poor selection results in costly turnover. When a salesperson quits, the costs of finding and training a new salesperson—plus the costs of lost sales—can be very high. One sales consulting firm calculates the total costs of a bad sales hire at a whopping $616,000.⁸ Also, a sales force with many new people is less productive, and turnover disrupts important customer relationships and sales team morale.

What sets great salespeople apart from all the rest? In an effort to profile top sales performers, Gallup Consulting, a division of the well-known Gallup polling organization, has interviewed hundreds of thousands of salespeople. Its research suggests that the best salespeople possess four key talents: intrinsic motivation, a disciplined work style, the ability to close a sale, and, perhaps most important, the ability to build relationships with customers.⁹ Super salespeople are motivated from within—they have an unrelenting drive to excel.
