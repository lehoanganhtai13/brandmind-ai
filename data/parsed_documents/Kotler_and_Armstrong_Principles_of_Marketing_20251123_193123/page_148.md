Although the costs and problems associated with international research may be high, the costs of not doing it—in terms of missed opportunities and mistakes—might be even higher. Once recognized, many of the problems associated with international marketing research can be overcome or avoided.

## Public Policy and Ethics in Marketing Research

Most marketing research benefits both the sponsoring company and its consumers. Through marketing research, companies gain insights into consumers’ needs, resulting in more satisfying products and services and stronger customer relationships. However, the misuse of marketing research can also harm or annoy consumers. Two major public policy and ethics issues in marketing research are intrusions on consumer privacy and the misuse of research findings.

### Intrusions on Consumer Privacy

Many consumers feel positive about marketing research and believe that it serves a useful purpose. Some actually enjoy being interviewed and giving their opinions. However, others strongly resent or even mistrust marketing research. They don’t like being interrupted by researchers. They worry that marketers are building huge databases full of personal information about customers. Or they fear that researchers might use sophisticated techniques to probe our deepest feelings, track our internet and mobile device usage, or peek over our shoulders as we shop and then use this knowledge to manipulate our buying. A recent survey showed that more than 90 percent of Americans feel that they have lost control over the collection and use by companies of their personal data and information they share on social media sites.  

For example, Target made some of its customers very uneasy recently when it used their buying histories to figure out that they had a baby on the way, including eerily accurate estimates of child gender and due date:

> Target gives every customer a Guest ID number, tied to his or her name, credit card, or email address. It then tracks the customer’s purchases in detail, along with demographic information from other sources. By studying the buying histories of women who’d previously signed up for its baby registries, Target found that it could develop a “pregnancy prediction” score for each customer based on her purchasing patterns across 25 product categories. It used this score to start sending personalized books of coupons for baby-related items to expectant parents, keyed to their pregnancy stages.  
>  
> The strategy seemed to make good marketing sense—by hooking parents-to-be, Target could turn them into loyal buyers as their families developed. However, the strategy hit a snag when an angry man showed up at his local Target store, complaining that his high school-aged daughter was receiving Target coupons for cribs, strollers, and maternity clothes. “Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?” he demanded. The Target store manager apologized. But when he called to apologize again a few days later, he learned that Target’s marketers had, in fact, known about the young woman’s pregnancy before her father did. It turns out that many other customers were creeped out that Target knew about their pregnancies before they’d told even family and close friends. And they wondered what else Target might be tracking and profiling.  
>  
> As one reporter concluded: “The store’s bull’s-eye logo may now send a shiver . . . down the closely-watched spines of some [Target shoppers].”

When mining customer information, marketers must be careful not to cross over the privacy line. But there are no easy answers when it comes to marketing research and privacy. For example, is it a good or bad thing that some retailers use mannequins with cameras hidden in one eye to record customer demographics and shopping behavior in order to serve them better?
