# Economic Situation

A person’s economic situation will affect his or her store and product choices. Marketers watch trends in spending, personal income, savings, and interest rates. In today’s more value-conscious times, most companies have taken steps to create more customer value by redesigning, repositioning, and repricing their products and services. For example, in recent years, upscale discounter Target has put more emphasis on the “Pay Less” side of its “Expect More. Pay Less.” positioning promise.

Similarly, in line with worldwide economic trends, smartphone makers who once offered only premium-priced phones are now offering lower-priced models for consumers both at home and in the world’s emerging economies. Microsoft’s Nokia division recently targeted emerging markets with lower-end Lumia models priced well under $100. And Apple is rumored to be introducing a lower-priced version of its iPhone. As their more affluent Western markets have become saturated and more competitive, the phone makers hope that their lower-priced phones will help them to compete effectively in less-affluent emerging Eastern markets such as China and Southeast Asia against low-cost smartphone makers such as Chinese giant Xiaomi.²²

## Lifestyle

**Lifestyle**  
A person’s pattern of living as expressed in his or her activities, interests, and opinions.

People coming from the same subculture, social class, and occupation may have quite different lifestyles. **Lifestyle** is a person’s pattern of living as expressed in his or her psychographics. It involves measuring consumers’ major AIO dimensions—_activities_ (work, hobbies, shopping, sports, social events), _interests_ (food, fashion, family, recreation), and _opinions_ (about themselves, social issues, business, products). Lifestyle captures something more than the person’s social class or personality. It profiles a person’s whole pattern of acting and interacting in the world.

When used carefully, the lifestyle concept can help marketers understand changing consumer values and how they affect buyer behavior. Consumers don’t just buy products; they buy the values and lifestyles those products represent. For example, The Body Shop markets much more than just beauty products. Its founder, Anita Roddick, has always been a strong advocate of ethical consumerism, human and animal rights issues, and environmental protection. When she made her first beauty products in 1976, she infused her philosophy in them by using natural and non-animal-tested ingredients, making them ethical and ecological statement pieces. As she grew her business, she continued to use her products as a platform for communicating more of her beliefs, like the importance of raising self-esteem in women. Although The Body Shop was sold to L’Oréal in 2006, its social and environmental commitment remains in its marketing DNA today. The present-day Body Shop brand stands for fighting exploitation of animals, the planet, and people by fighting animal cruelty, protecting endangered creatures, preserving the rainforest, and supporting fair trade. Its “BioBridges” campaign, aimed at restoring wildlife corridors in the rainforest, was supported by several social media activities that engaged with consumers conscious about sustainability.

Marketers look for lifestyle segments with needs that can be served through special products or marketing approaches. Such segments might be defined by anything from family characteristics or outdoor interests to the foods people eat.
