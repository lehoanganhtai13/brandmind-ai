# Product Line Pricing

Setting the price steps between various products in a product line based on cost differences between the products, customer evaluations of different features, and competitors’ prices.

Companies usually develop product lines rather than single products. In **product line pricing**, management must determine the price steps to set between the various products in a line. The price steps should take into account cost differences between products in the line. More important, they should account for differences in customer perceptions of the value of different features.

For example, Quicken offers an entire line of financial management software, including Starter, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business, and Rental Property Manager versions priced at $29.99, $64.99, $94.99, $104.99, and $154.99, respectively. Although it costs Quicken no more to produce the Premier version than the Starter version, many buyers happily pay more to obtain additional Premier features, such as financial-planning, retirement, and investment-monitoring tools. Quicken’s task is to establish perceived value differences that support the price differences.

# Optional-Product Pricing

**Optional-product pricing**  
The pricing of optional or accessory products along with a main product.

Many companies use **optional-product pricing**—pricing optional or accessory products along with the main product. For example, a car buyer may choose to order a navigation system and premium entertainment system. Refrigerators come with optional ice makers. And when you order a new laptop, you can select from a bewildering array of processors, hard drives, docking systems, software options, and service plans. Pricing these options is a sticky problem. Companies must decide which items to include in the base price and which to offer as options.

# Captive-Product Pricing

**Captive-product pricing**  
Setting a price for products that must be used along with a main product, such as blades for a razor and games for a video-game console.

Companies that make products that must be used along with a main product are using **captive-product pricing**. Examples of captive products are razor blade cartridges, video games, printer cartridges, single-serve coffee pods, and e-books. Producers of the main products (razors, video-game consoles, printers, single-cup coffee brewing systems, and tablet computers) often price them low and set high markups on the supplies.  

For example, Amazon makes little or no profit on its Kindle readers and tablets. It hopes to more than make up for thin margins through sales of digital books, music, movies, subscription services, and other content for the devices. “We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices,” declares Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

> Captive products can account for a substantial portion of a brand’s sales and profits. For example, only a relatively small percentage of Keurig’s revenues come from the sale of its single-cup brewing systems. The bulk of the brand’s revenues—nearly 77 percent—comes from captive sales of its K-Cup portion packs. However, companies that use captive-product pricing must be careful. Finding the right balance between the main-product and captive-product prices can be tricky. Even more, consumers trapped into buying expensive captive products may come to resent the brand that ensnared them.

For example, some customers of single-cup coffee brewing systems may cringe at what they must pay for those handy little coffee portion packs. Although they might seem like a bargain when compared on a cost-per-cup basis versus Starbucks, the pods’ prices can seem like highway robbery when broken down by the pound. One investigator calculated the cost of pod coffee at a shocking $50 per pound. At those prices, you’d be better off cost-wise brewing a big pot of premium coffee and pouring out the unused portion. For many buyers,
