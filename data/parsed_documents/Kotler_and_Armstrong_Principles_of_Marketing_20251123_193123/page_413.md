care, and medical supply and equipment products? Or how about wholesaler Arrow
Electronics, which supplies $23 billion worth of computer chips, capacitors, and other elec-
tronics and computer components annually to more than 100,000 original equipment man-
ufacturers and commercial customers through a global network of more than 460 locations
in 56 countries? ● And you may never have heard of a company called Grainger, even
though it is very well known and much valued by its more than 2 million business and in-
stitutional customers in more than 150 countries:36

Grainger may be the biggest market leader you’ve never heard of. It’s a $10 billion business
that offers more than 1.5 million maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) products from 4,800
manufacturers to more than 2 million active customers. Through its branch network, service
centers, sales reps, catalog, and online and social media sites, Grainger links customers with the
supplies they need to keep their facilities running smoothly—everything from lightbulbs, clean-
ers, and display cases to nuts and bolts, motors, valves, power
tools, test equipment, and safety supplies. Grainger’s nearly
670 branches, 34 strategically located distribution centers, more
than 25,000 employees, and innovative web and mobile sites
handle more than 140,000 transactions a day. Grainger’s cus-
tomers include organizations ranging from factories, garages,
and grocers to schools and military bases.
Grainger operates on a simple value proposition: to make
it easier and less costly for customers to find and buy MRO sup-
plies. It starts by acting as a one-stop shop for products needed to
maintain facilities. On a broader level, it builds lasting relationships
with customers by helping them find *solutions* to their overall MRO
problems. Acting as consultants, Grainger sales reps help buyers
with everything from improving their supply chain management
to reducing inventories and streamlining warehousing operations.
So, how come you’ve never heard of Grainger? Perhaps
it’s because the company operates in the not-so-glamorous
world of MRO supplies, which are important to every business
but not so important to consumers. More likely, it’s because
Grainger is a wholesaler. And like most wholesalers, it operates
behind the scenes, selling mostly to other businesses.

Why are wholesalers important to sellers? For example, why would a producer use
wholesalers rather than selling directly to retailers or consumers? Simply put, wholesalers
add value by performing one or more of the following channel functions:

* *Selling and promoting.* Wholesalers’ sales forces help manufacturers reach many small customers at a low cost. The wholesaler has more contacts and is often more trusted by the buyer than the distant manufacturer.
* *Buying and assortment building.* Wholesalers can select items and build assortments needed by their customers, thereby saving much work.
* *Bulk breaking.* Wholesalers save their customers money by buying in carload lots and breaking bulk (breaking large lots into small quantities).
* *Warehousing.* Wholesalers hold inventories, thereby reducing the inventory costs and risks of suppliers and customers.
* *Transportation.* Wholesalers can provide quicker delivery to buyers because they are closer to buyers than are producers.
* *Financing.* Wholesalers finance their customers by giving credit, and they finance their suppliers by ordering early and paying bills on time.
* *Risk bearing.* Wholesalers absorb risk by taking title and bearing the cost of theft, damage, spoilage, and obsolescence.
* *Market information.* Wholesalers give information to suppliers and customers about competitors, new products, and price developments.
* *Management services and advice.* Wholesalers often help retailers train their salesclerks, improve store layouts and displays, and set up accounting and inventory control systems.

**Merchant wholesaler**  
An independently owned wholesale business that takes title to the merchandise it handles.

## Types of Wholesalers

Wholesalers fall into three major groups (see ● Table 13.3): *merchant wholesalers, brokers and agents,* and *manufacturers’ and retailers’ branches and offices.* **Merchant wholesalers** are the largest single group of wholesalers, accounting for roughly 50 percent of all *(Continued)*
