Creating customer experiences: More than just selling products, Apple’s highly successful retail stores create engaging life-feels-good brand experiences.

Between these two extremes, however, many goods-and-services combinations are possible.

Today, as products and services become more commoditized, many companies are moving to a new level in creating value for their customers. To differentiate their offers, beyond simply making products and delivering services, they are creating and managing customer *experiences* with their brands or companies.

Experiences have always been an important part of marketing for some companies. Disney has long manufactured dreams and memories through its movies and theme parks—it wants theme park cast members to deliver a thousand “small wows” to every customer. And Nike has long declared, “It’s not so much the shoes but where they take you.” Today, however, all kinds of firms are recasting their traditional goods and services to create experiences.

* For example, Apple’s highly successful retail stores don’t just sell the company’s products. They create an engaging Apple brand experience:  
Apple’s retail stores are very seductive places, where “life-feels-good” experiences abound. The store design is clean, simple, and just oozing with style—much like an Apple iPad or a featherweight MacBook Air. The bustling stores feel more like community centers than retail outlets, with crowds of customers sampling the goods and buzzing excitedly about all things Apple. The stores encourage a lot of purchasing, to be sure. But they also encourage lingering, with tables full of fully functioning Macs, iPods, iPads, and iPhones sitting out for visitors to try and dozens of laid-back Apple employees close at hand to answer questions and cater to every whim. The stores offer expert technical assistance at the Genius Bar and a full schedule of workshops where customers at all experience levels can learn about their Apple devices and explore their creative sides. You don’t just visit an Apple store—you experience it in a way that no other consumer electronics company can match. As one Apple retail executive explains, “I don’t want to be sold to when I walk into a store. Don’t sell! No! Because that’s a turn-off. Build an amazing brand experience, and then [sales] will just naturally happen.”

## Levels of Product and Services

Product planners need to think about products and services on three levels (see **Figure 8.1**). Each level adds more customer value. The most basic level is the *core customer value*, which addresses the question: *What is the buyer really buying?* When designing products, marketers must first define the core, problem-solving benefits or services that

This table outlines the "Three Levels of Product," presenting a hierarchical structure that builds from fundamental customer needs to enhanced offerings. At the base is the "Core Customer Value," representing the essential benefit a consumer seeks. Surrounding this core is the "Actual Product," which comprises tangible attributes such as brand name, quality level, packaging, design, and features, all designed to deliver the core value. Finally, the "Augmented Product" encompasses additional services and benefits that go beyond the actual product, including delivery and credit, product support, warranty, and after-sale service, further differentiating the offering and enhancing customer satisfaction.

> At the most basic level, the company asks, “What is the customer really buying?” For example, people who buy an Apple iPad are buying more than just a tablet computer. They are buying entertainment, self-expression, productivity, and connectivity—a mobile and personal window to the world.
