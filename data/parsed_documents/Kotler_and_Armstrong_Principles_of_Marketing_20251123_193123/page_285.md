# Concept Development

A *product concept* is a detailed version of the idea stated in meaningful consumer terms. A *product image* is the way consumers perceive an actual or potential product.

Suppose a car manufacturer has developed a practical battery-powered, all-electric car. Its initial models were a sleek, sporty roadster convertible selling for more than $100,000, followed by a full-size sports sedan priced at $71,000. However, in the near future it plans to introduce a more-affordable, mass-market compact version that will compete with recently introduced hybrid-electric or all-electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt, KIA Soul EV, and Chevy Bolt EV. This 100 percent plug-in electric car will accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds, travel up to 300 miles on a single charge, recharge in 45 minutes from a normal 120-volt electrical outlet, and cost about one penny per mile to power.

Looking ahead, the marketer’s task is to develop this new product into alternative product concepts, find out how attractive each concept is to customers, and choose the best one. It might create the following product concepts for this all-electric car:

* Concept 1. An affordably priced compact car designed as a second family car to be used around town for running errands and visiting friends.
* Concept 2. A mid-priced sporty compact appealing to young singles and couples.
* Concept 3. A “green” everyday car appealing to environmentally conscious people who want practical, no-polluting transportation.
* Concept 4. A compact crossover SUV appealing to those who love the space SUVs provide but lament the poor gas mileage.

All-electric cars: This is Tesla’s initial all-electric full-size sedan. Later, more-affordable compact models will travel more than 300 miles on a single charge, recharge in 45 minutes from a normal 120-volt electrical outlet, and cost about one penny per mile to power. Tesla

# Concept Testing

**Concept testing** calls for testing new product concepts with groups of target consumers. The concepts may be presented to consumers symbolically or physically. Here, in more detail, is concept 3:

> An efficient, fun-to-drive, battery-powered compact car that seats four. This 100 percent electric wonder provides practical and reliable transportation with no pollution. It goes 300 miles on a single charge and costs pennies per mile to operate. It’s a sensible, responsible alternative to today’s pollution-producing gas-guzzlers. Its fully equipped base price is $28,800.

Many firms routinely test new product concepts with consumers before attempting to turn them into actual new products. For some concept tests, a word or picture description might be sufficient. However, a more concrete and physical presentation of the concept will increase the reliability of the concept test. After being exposed to the concept, consumers then may be asked to react to it by answering questions similar to those in **Table 9.1**.

The answers to such questions will help the company decide which concept has the strongest appeal. For example, the last question asks about the consumer’s intention to buy. Suppose 2 percent of consumers say they “definitely” would buy and another 5 percent say “probably.” The company could project these figures to the full population in this target group to estimate sales volume. Even then, however, the estimate is uncertain because people do not always carry out their stated intentions.

# Marketing Strategy Development

Suppose the carmaker finds that concept 3 for the new electric car model tests best. The next step is **marketing strategy development**, designing an initial marketing strategy for introducing this car to the market.
