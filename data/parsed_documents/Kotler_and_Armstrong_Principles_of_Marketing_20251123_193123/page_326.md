### Critical Thinking Exercises

- [x] **10-6** Congratulations! You just won your state lottery and will be receiving a check for $1 million. You have always wanted to own your own business and have noticed the increase in the number of food trucks in your local area. A new food truck with a kitchen and related equipment costs about $100,000. Other fixed costs include salaries, gas for the truck, and license fees and are estimated to be about $50,000 per year. You decide to offer traditional Mediterranean cuisine. Variable costs include food and beverages estimated at $6 per platter (meat, rice, vegetable, and pita bread). Meals will be priced at $10. Calculate the break-even for your food truck business. After reviewing your break-even, what changes would you consider? Is this how you want to spend your lottery winnings? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  
- **10-7** In a small group, discuss your perceptions of value and how much you are willing to pay for the following products: automobiles, frozen dinners, jeans, and athletic shoes. Are there differences among members of your group? Explain why those differences exist. Discuss some examples of brands of these products that are positioned to deliver different value to consumers. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  
- **10-8** Economic conditions can have a strong impact on a firm’s pricing strategies. In the aftermath of the recent Great Recession, many companies adjusted prices by cutting prices or offering discounts. Nike’s approach was somewhat different considering their value of products and customer loyalty. Identify key factors and reflect on Nike’s approach to pricing after the recent recession.

# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  *Sold Out*  
Even before tickets went on general sale for the Rugby World Cup 2015, tickets were being offered on the secondary market for up to $14,000 for a $200 ticket—around 44 times the face value of the ticket. The 1 million general sale tickets were later offered for sale by ballot. The over-priced tickets were thought to have been legitimately secured hospitality packages bought by an individual or company in the hope that they could turn a big profit on them.
