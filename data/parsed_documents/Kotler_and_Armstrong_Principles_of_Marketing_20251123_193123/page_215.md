# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

So, for instance, Macy’s stores in Michigan stock more locally made Sanders chocolate candies. In Orlando, Macy’s carries more swimsuits in stores near waterparks and more twin bedding in stores near condominium rentals. The chain stocks extra coffee percolators in its Long Island stores, where it sells more of the 1960s must-haves than anywhere else in the country. In all, the “MyMacy’s” strategy is to meet the needs of local markets, making the giant retailer seem smaller and more in touch.³

## Demographic Segmentation

**Demographic segmentation** divides the market into segments based on variables such as age, life-cycle stage, gender, income, occupation, education, religion, ethnicity, and generation. Demographic factors are the most popular bases for segmenting customer groups. One reason is that consumer needs, wants, and usage rates often vary closely with demographic variables. Another is that demographic variables are easier to measure than most other types of variables. Even when marketers first define segments using other bases, such as benefits sought or behavior, they must know a segment’s demographic characteristics to assess the size of the target market and reach it efficiently.

### Age and Life-Cycle Stage

Consumer needs and wants change with age. Some companies use **age and life-cycle segmentation**, offering different products or using different marketing approaches for different age and life-cycle groups. For example, Kraft’s Oscar Mayer brand markets Lunchables, convenient prepackaged lunches for children. To extend the substantial success of Lunchables, however, Oscar Mayer later introduced Lunchables Uploaded, a version designed to meet the tastes and sensibilities of teenagers. Most recently, the brand launched an adult version, but with the more adult-friendly name P3 (Portable Protein Pack). Now, consumers of all ages can enjoy one of America’s favorite noontime meals.

Marketers must be careful to guard against stereotypes when using age and life-cycle segmentation. For example, although some 80-year-olds fit the stereotypes of doddering shut-ins with fixed incomes, others ski and play tennis. Similarly, whereas some 40-year-old couples are sending their children off to college, others are just beginning new families. Thus, age is often a poor predictor of a person’s life cycle, health, work or family status, needs, and buying power.

### Gender

**Gender segmentation** has long been used in marketing clothing, cosmetics, toiletries, toys, and magazines. For example, P&G was among the first to use gender segmentation with Secret, a deodorant brand specially formulated for a woman’s chemistry, packaged and advertised to reinforce the female image.

More recently, the men’s personal care industry has exploded, and many cosmetics brands that previously catered mostly to women—from L’Oréal, Nivea, and Sephora to Unilever’s Dove brand—now successfully market men’s lines. For example, Dove’s Men+Care line calls itself “The authority on man maintenance.” The brand provides a full line of body washes (“skin care built in”), body bars (“fight skin dryness”), antiperspirants (“tough on sweat, not on skin”), face care (“take better care of your face”), and hair care (“3X stronger hair”).⁴

Going in the other direction, brands that have traditionally targeted men are now targeting women. 🔵 For example, in line with the “athleisure” trend in which more women are wearing workout gear as everyday fashion, sports apparel makers and retailers—from Nike and Under Armour to Dick’s Sporting Goods—are boosting their marketing efforts aimed at women buyers. Women now make up half of all sporting good shoppers. Dick’s Sporting Goods recently launched its first-ever ads aimed directly at fitness-minded women, as part of its broader “Who Will You Be?” campaign. The ads feature women who must juggle their busy lives to meet their fitness goals. The first ad in the series shows one mom jogging rather than driving to pick up her sons at school. Another mom jogs on a treadmill while listening to her baby.
