  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a structured approach to advertising management, moving from initial objective setting through to evaluation. The process begins with defining clear Objectives setting, encompassing both Communication objectives and Sales objectives. Subsequently, Budget decisions are made, employing various methods such as the Affordable approach, Percent of sales, Competitive parity, and the Objective and task method. Following budget allocation, Message decisions are crucial, involving the development of a Message strategy and its Message execution. This leads into Media decisions, which cover Media strategy, Impact and engagement considerations, selection of Major media types and Specific media vehicles, and Media timing. Finally, the entire process culminates in Advertising evaluation, assessing Communication impact, Sales and profit impact, and ultimately, the Return on advertising investment. This represents a sequential, decision-driven framework for advertising planning and execution.",
