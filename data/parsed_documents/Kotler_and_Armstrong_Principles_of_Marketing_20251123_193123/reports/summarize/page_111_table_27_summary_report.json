  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a chronological progression of U.S. legislation aimed at regulating business practices and protecting consumers. Early acts like the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and the Clayton Act (1914) focused on preventing monopolies and unfair trade practices, with the Federal Trade Commission Act (1914) establishing an agency to monitor these. Subsequent legislation expanded regulatory scope to include product safety and labeling, such as the Federal Food and Drug Act (1906), the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (1966), and the Consumer Product Safety Act (1972). Further acts addressed specific areas like advertising (Wheeler-Lea Act, 1938; CAN-SPAM Act, 2003), trademarks (Lanham Trademark Act, 1946), and telemarketing (Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 1991; Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, 2003). More recent laws, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (2000) and the Financial Reform Law (2010), reflect evolving consumer protection needs in digital and financial realms, alongside broader civil rights protections like the Americans with Disabilities Act (1991).",
