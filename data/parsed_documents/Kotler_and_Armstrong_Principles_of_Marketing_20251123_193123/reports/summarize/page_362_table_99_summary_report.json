  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two primary categories of marketing channels: Consumer marketing channels and Business marketing channels. Consumer marketing channels are further divided into direct channels, where a company sells directly to consumers (e.g., GEICO, Amway), and indirect channels, which involve one or more intermediaries. Indirect consumer channels can include a producer selling to a retailer who then sells to the consumer (Channel 2), or a producer selling to a wholesaler who then sells to a retailer, who finally sells to the consumer (Channel 3). Business marketing channels primarily utilize indirect channels, involving intermediaries such as business distributors, manufacturer's representatives, or sales branches to reach business customers. These channels can involve a producer selling directly to a business distributor who then sells to a business customer (Channel 2), or a producer selling to a business distributor who then sells to another business distributor, who finally sells to the business customer (Channel 3).",
