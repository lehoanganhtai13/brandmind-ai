  "summary_markdown": "Figure 7.4 outlines possible value propositions by cross-referencing the level of benefits offered against the price charged. The structure is a 3x3 matrix, with \"Benefits\" on one axis (More, The same, Less) and \"Price\" on the other (More, The same, Less). Each cell represents a distinct value proposition. \"More for more\" signifies higher benefits at a higher price. \"More for the same\" offers increased benefits at a comparable price. \"More for less\" provides greater benefits for a lower price. \"The same for less\" delivers equivalent benefits at a reduced price, and \"Less for much less\" offers reduced benefits at a significantly lower price. Some cells are marked in red, indicating potentially unsustainable or undesirable propositions, while others are yellow, suggesting a less optimal but potentially viable position. The overall framework illustrates how companies can position their offerings based on the interplay of perceived benefits and price points.",
