  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a cost structure analysis, likely for a business or product. It identifies three key financial variables: a **variable cost** of $10 per unit, **fixed costs** totaling $300,000, and **expected unit sales** projected at 50,000 units. The structure is comparative, detailing the distinct cost components and their expected volume. This information is foundational for calculating break-even points, profitability, and overall financial performance based on sales volume. The relationship between these variables is direct: variable costs scale with production/sales, fixed costs remain constant regardless of volume, and expected sales provide the volume context for evaluating the impact of these costs.",
