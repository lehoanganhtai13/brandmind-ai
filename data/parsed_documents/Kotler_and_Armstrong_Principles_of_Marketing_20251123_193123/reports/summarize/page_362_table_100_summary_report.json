  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines different levels of marketing channels, focusing on the presence or absence of intermediaries. The **Channel level** is defined as a layer of intermediaries facilitating product and ownership transfer closer to the buyer. A **Direct marketing channel** is characterized by the complete absence of any intermediaries. Conversely, an **Indirect marketing channel** is distinguished by the inclusion of one or more intermediary levels between the producer and the final buyer. This structure presents a comparative overview of channel types based on their intermediary composition.",
