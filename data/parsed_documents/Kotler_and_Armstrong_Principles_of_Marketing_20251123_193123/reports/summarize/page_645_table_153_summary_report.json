  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a hierarchical breakdown of a company's financial performance, starting with Net Sales and progressing through various expense categories to arrive at Net Profit Before Income Tax. Net Sales are established at $125,000,000, representing 100% of sales. The Cost of Goods Sold is then deducted, amounting to $62,500,000 (50% of sales), resulting in a Gross Margin of $62,500,000 (50% of sales). Following this, Marketing Expenses are detailed, encompassing Sales expenses ($17,500,000), Promotion expenses ($15,000,000), and Freight ($12,500,000), totaling $45,000,000 (36% of sales). General and Administrative Expenses, including Managerial salaries and expenses ($2,000,000) and Indirect overhead ($3,000,000), sum to $5,000,000 (4% of sales). Finally, subtracting these aggregated expenses from the Gross Margin yields a Net Profit Before Income Tax of $12,500,000, which constitutes 10% of sales.",
