  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a three-stage strategic process for competitor analysis. The initial stage involves **Identifying** the company’s competitors, establishing the scope of the competitive landscape. Following this, the core of the analysis focuses on **Assessing** competitors’ objectives, strategies, strengths and weaknesses, and reaction patterns, aiming to understand their current and future intentions and capabilities. The final stage culminates in **Selecting** which competitors to attack or avoid, based on the insights gained from the assessment, thereby guiding strategic resource allocation and competitive engagement. This structured approach moves from broad identification to detailed assessment and finally to strategic decision-making regarding competitive interactions.",
