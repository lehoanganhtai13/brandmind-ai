  "summary_markdown": "This diagram illustrates two distinct pathways for product distribution originating from a manufacturer. Pathway A depicts direct contact with customers, showing a manufacturer interacting with customers numbered 1 through 9, with some instances of direct manufacturer-to-customer sales (indicated by the arrow). Pathway B, in contrast, details a distribution model involving intermediaries. Here, a manufacturer also interacts with customers numbered 1 through 6, but these interactions are mediated by a distributor. Specifically, manufacturer 1 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 2. Manufacturer 2 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 3. Manufacturer 4 contacts a distributor, who then contacts customer 4, and so on, up to manufacturer 6. Manufacturers 7, 8, and 9 are shown with direct arrows, implying potential direct contact or an incomplete representation of their distribution channels within this specific comparison. The structure highlights a comparative analysis of direct versus indirect (distributor-mediated) sales channels.",
