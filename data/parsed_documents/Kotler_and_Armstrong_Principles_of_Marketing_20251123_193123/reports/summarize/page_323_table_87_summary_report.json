  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of two distinct price points and their corresponding quantities demanded. It illustrates a fundamental economic principle where different prices, denoted as \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\), are associated with varying levels of demand, represented by quantities \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\) respectively. The structure suggests a direct relationship between price and quantity demanded, implying that as price changes, so does the quantity consumers are willing to purchase within a given period. This data likely serves to demonstrate the concept of the demand curve, where typically a higher price corresponds to a lower quantity demanded, and vice versa. The table's layout facilitates a straightforward comparison of these two scenarios.",
