  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines various pricing strategies, categorized by their approach to price adjustment. Discount and allowance pricing involves reducing prices to incentivize specific customer actions like bulk purchases or early payments. Segmented pricing allows for price variations based on customer differences, product variations, or location. Psychological pricing focuses on adjusting prices for their perceived impact on consumer behavior. Promotional pricing is a tactic of temporary price reductions to boost immediate sales. Geographical pricing specifically modifies prices to reflect customer locations. Dynamic pricing involves continuous price adjustments to match individual customer needs and situational factors. Finally, international pricing addresses the complexities of setting prices in different global markets. These strategies collectively represent a spectrum of methods businesses employ to optimize their pricing in response to market dynamics and customer behavior.",
