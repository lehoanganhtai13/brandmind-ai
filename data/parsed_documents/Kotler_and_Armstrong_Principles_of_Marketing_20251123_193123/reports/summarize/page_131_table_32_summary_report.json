  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a four-stage research process, presented sequentially. The first stage involves **Defining the problem and research objectives**, establishing the foundational scope and goals of the inquiry. This is followed by **Developing the research plan for collecting information**, which details the methodology and strategies for gathering relevant data. The third stage, **Implementing the research plan—collecting and analyzing the data**, focuses on the execution of the plan, encompassing the actual data acquisition and subsequent examination. Finally, the process culminates in **Interpreting and reporting the findings**, where the analyzed data is understood and communicated. The structure is linear and process-oriented, guiding the researcher through distinct phases from initial conceptualization to final dissemination.",
