  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of pricing and contribution metrics under an \"Old\" and \"New\" scenario, where the new scenario reflects a 10% price reduction. The \"Old\" price is $1.00 with a unit variable cost of $0.79, resulting in a unit contribution of $0.21 and a contribution margin of 21%. In the \"New\" scenario, the price is reduced to $0.90, while the unit variable cost remains constant at $0.79. This price reduction leads to a decreased unit contribution of $0.11 and a significantly lower contribution margin of 12%. The structure highlights the direct impact of a price decrease on profitability, assuming stable variable costs.",
