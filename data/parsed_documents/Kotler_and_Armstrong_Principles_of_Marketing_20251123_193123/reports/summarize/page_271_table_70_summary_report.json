  "summary_markdown": "This framework analyzes brand development opportunities by categorizing strategies based on whether the product category is existing or new, and whether the brand itself is existing or new. When a company uses an existing brand for an existing product category, it's a line extension. Introducing an existing brand into a new product category constitutes a brand extension. If a company uses a new brand for an existing product category, it's a multibrands strategy. Finally, launching a new brand in a new product category is categorized as a new brands strategy. This structure provides a clear matrix for understanding different approaches to brand expansion and market entry.",
