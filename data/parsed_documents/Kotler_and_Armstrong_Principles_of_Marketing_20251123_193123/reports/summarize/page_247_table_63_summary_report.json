  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a classification of consumer products, differentiating them based on purchasing behavior and effort. A **Consumer product** is defined as an item acquired by end-users for personal use. Within this category, **Convenience products** are characterized by frequent, immediate purchases with minimal deliberation or effort. In contrast, **Shopping products** require customers to engage in a comparison process, evaluating attributes like suitability, quality, price, and style before making a selection and purchase. This structure presents a hierarchical breakdown of consumer goods, moving from the general definition to more specific types defined by customer engagement levels.",
