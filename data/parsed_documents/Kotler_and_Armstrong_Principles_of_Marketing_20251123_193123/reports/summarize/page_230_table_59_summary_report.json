  "summary_markdown": "This figure presents a positioning map for large luxury SUVs, illustrating how consumers perceive brands based on two key dimensions: price (on the y-axis, in thousands of dollars) and luxury-performance orientation (implied on the x-axis, though not explicitly labeled). Brands are represented by circles, with their position indicating their perceived standing on these attributes. The size of each circle signifies the brand's relative market share within this segment. For instance, the Cadillac Escalade is positioned at a high price point and likely high on the luxury-performance scale, while the Infiniti QX and Lexus LX570 are also in a high-price, high-luxury-performance area. The Toyota Land Cruiser is depicted as a niche brand, perceived as relatively expensive and more performance-oriented, with a smaller market share indicated by its circle size. Other brands like the Lincoln Navigator, Land Rover Range Rover, and Toyota Land Cruiser are mapped according to their respective consumer perceptions of price and luxury-performance.",
