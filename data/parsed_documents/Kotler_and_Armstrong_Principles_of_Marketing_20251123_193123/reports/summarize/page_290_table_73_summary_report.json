  "summary_markdown": "This diagram illustrates the typical trajectory of sales and profits throughout a product's life cycle, from its initial conception through to its eventual decline. The horizontal axis represents time, segmented into distinct stages: Product development, Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The vertical axis depicts financial values, with losses and investment shown on the left and sales and profits on the right. Two key trends are visualized: sales, represented by a blue line, and profits, shown in red. Initially, during product development and introduction, both sales and profits are negative, reflecting investment costs. As the product moves into the growth phase, sales begin to rise sharply, followed by profits. The maturity stage sees sales peak and then plateau, while profits also reach their highest point before starting to decline. Finally, in the decline stage, both sales and profits decrease, eventually falling below profitability. This demonstrates a clear, sequential progression of financial performance tied to the product's market presence.",
