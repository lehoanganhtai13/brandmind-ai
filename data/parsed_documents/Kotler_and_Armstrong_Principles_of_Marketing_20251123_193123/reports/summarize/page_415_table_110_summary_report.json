Used most often in agricultural marketing by farmers who do not want to sell their own output. Take a truckload of commodities to a central market, sell it for the best price, deduct a commission and expenses, and remit the balance to the producers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Manufacturers’ and retailers’ branches and offices</b></td>\n<td>Wholesaling operations conducted by sellers or buyers themselves rather than operating through independent wholesalers.

  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines different types of wholesale intermediaries, categorizing them by their operational structure and relationship with buyers and sellers. Purchasing agents typically maintain long-term buyer relationships, handling procurement, inspection, warehousing, and shipping. Commission merchants, often used in agriculture, take physical possession of goods, negotiate sales, deduct commissions and expenses, and remit the balance to producers. Manufacturers' and retailers' branches and offices represent integrated wholesaling operations, either for sales or purchasing, conducted by the buyer or seller themselves. Within this category, sales branches, which carry inventory, are established by manufacturers for inventory control, selling, and promotion, while sales offices, which do not carry inventory, focus on sales and promotion. Purchasing offices, functioning similarly to brokers or agents, are part of the buyer's organization, often established by retailers in major market centers.",
