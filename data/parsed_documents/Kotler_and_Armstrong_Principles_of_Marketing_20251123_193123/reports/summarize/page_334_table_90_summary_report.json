  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines five distinct pricing situations related to product strategy. Product line pricing involves setting prices for a range of related products. Optional-product pricing focuses on the pricing of accessories or add-ons that accompany a main product. Captive-product pricing addresses the pricing of essential complementary products required for the main product's use. By-product pricing deals with the strategic pricing of secondary, often low-value, outputs generated during the production of a primary product, either for disposal or profit. Finally, product bundle pricing involves setting a single price for a package of multiple products sold together. These strategies represent different approaches to managing pricing across a company's product offerings and their associated components or combinations.",
