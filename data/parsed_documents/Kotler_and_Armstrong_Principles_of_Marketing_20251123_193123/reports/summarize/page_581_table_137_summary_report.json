  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines key environmental factors influencing international business, categorized into four main areas: Demographic, Sociocultural, Geographic, and Political/Legal, with a distinct section for Economic Factors. Demographic characteristics encompass education levels, population size and growth, and age composition. Sociocultural factors include consumer lifestyles, beliefs, values, business norms, cultural and social norms, and languages. Geographic characteristics involve climate, country size, population density (urban/rural), and transportation infrastructure. Political and Legal factors cover national priorities, political stability, government attitudes towards global trade, bureaucracy, and monetary/trade regulations. Finally, Economic Factors are broadly defined by GDP size and growth, income distribution, industrial infrastructure, natural resources, and financial/human resources. These interconnected elements collectively shape the landscape for international business operations.",
