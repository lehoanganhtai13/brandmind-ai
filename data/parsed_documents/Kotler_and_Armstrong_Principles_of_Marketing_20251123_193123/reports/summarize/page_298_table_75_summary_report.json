  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines the characteristics, marketing objectives, and strategies associated with the four stages of a product life cycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The cycle progresses from low sales and negative profits with innovators as customers in the Introduction phase, to rapidly rising sales and increasing profits with early adopters in the Growth phase. The Maturity stage sees peak sales, high profits, and mainstream adopters, with a stable but potentially declining competitor base. Finally, the Decline phase is marked by declining sales and profits, with lagging adopters and a decreasing number of competitors. Marketing objectives shift from creating awareness and trial to maximizing market share and profit, and then to reducing expenditure. Strategies for product, price, distribution, advertising, and sales promotion are adapted at each stage to align with these evolving market conditions and objectives.",
