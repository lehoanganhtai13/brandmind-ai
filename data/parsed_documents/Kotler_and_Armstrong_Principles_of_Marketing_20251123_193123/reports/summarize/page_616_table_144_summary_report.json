  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a four-category framework for classifying products based on their immediate consumer satisfaction and long-run consumer benefit. The framework is structured as a 2x2 matrix. Products offering high immediate satisfaction and high long-run consumer benefit are categorized as **Desirable products**. Conversely, those with low immediate satisfaction and low long-run consumer benefit are termed Deficient products. Products that provide high immediate satisfaction but offer low long-run consumer benefit are classified as Pleasing products. Finally, products with low immediate satisfaction but high long-run consumer benefit are identified as Salutary products. This classification system highlights the trade-offs between short-term gratification and sustained value for consumers.",
