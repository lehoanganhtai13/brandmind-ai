  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines fundamental cost concepts in production economics. It defines **Fixed costs** as expenses that remain constant regardless of output volume, and **Variable costs** as those that fluctuate directly with the level of production. The table further establishes **Total costs** as the aggregate of fixed and variable costs at any specific production output. This structure presents a comparative framework for understanding cost behavior, differentiating between static and dynamic cost elements to arrive at an overall cost picture.",
