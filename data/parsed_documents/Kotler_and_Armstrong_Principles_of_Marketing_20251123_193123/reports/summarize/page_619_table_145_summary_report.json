It is not really “new and improved,” but you know that putting this statement on the package and in advertising will increase sales. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2.</td><td>You have been asked to add a stripped-down model to your line that could be advertised to pull customers into the store. The product won’t be very good but salespeople will be able to switch buyers who come into the store up to higher-priced units. You are asked to give the green light for the stripped-down version. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3.</td><td>You are thinking of hiring a product manager who has just left a competitor’s company. She would be more than happy to tell you all the competitor’s plans for the coming year. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4.</td><td>One of your top dealers in an important territory recently has had family troubles and his sales have slipped. It looks like it will take him a while to straighten out his family problems. Meanwhile, you are losing many sales. Legally, on performance grounds, you can terminate the dealer’s franchise and replace him. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5.</td><td>You have a chance to win a big account in another country that will mean a lot to you and your company. The purchasing agent hints that a “gift” would influence the decision. Such gifts are common in that country and some of your competitors will probably make one. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6.</td><td>You have heard that a competitor has a new product feature that will make a big difference in sales. The competitor will demonstrate the feature in a private dealer meeting at the annual trade show. You can easily send a snooper to this meeting to learn about the new feature. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7.</td><td>You have to choose between three advertising and social media campaigns outlined by your agency. The first (a) is a soft-sell, honest, straight-information campaign. The second (b) uses sex-loaded emotional appeals and exaggerates the product’s benefits. The third (c) involves a noisy, somewhat irritating commercial that is sure to gain audience attention. Pretests show that the campaigns are effective in the following order: c, b, and a. What would you do?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8.</td><td>You are interviewing a capable female applicant for a job as salesperson. She is better qualified than the men who have been interviewed. Nevertheless, you know that in your industry some important customers prefer dealing with men and you will lose some sales if you hire her. What would you do?</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
  "summary_markdown": "Table 20.1 presents a series of eight morally difficult situations encountered in marketing, structured as a comparative dilemma. Each situation poses a choice between potentially unethical or questionable actions and more principled, albeit possibly less profitable, alternatives. The scenarios cover product claims and improvements, product line strategies, hiring practices involving competitor information, dealer management, international business dealings with bribery implications, competitive intelligence gathering, advertising campaign selection based on effectiveness versus ethical appeal, and gender-based hiring decisions impacting sales. The overarching theme is the conflict between maximizing sales and profit versus adhering to ethical marketing principles and fair business practices.",
