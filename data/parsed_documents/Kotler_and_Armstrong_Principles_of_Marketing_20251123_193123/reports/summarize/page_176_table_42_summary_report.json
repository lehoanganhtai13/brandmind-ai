  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines the five key stages of the consumer decision-making process. It begins with **Need recognition**, where a consumer identifies a problem or unmet need. This is followed by **Information search**, where the consumer actively seeks information about potential solutions. Next, **Evaluation of alternatives** involves assessing the various options identified during the search phase based on specific criteria. The process then moves to the **Purchase decision**, where the consumer chooses a product or service. Finally, **Postpurchase behavior** encompasses the consumer's experience after the purchase, including satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and potential repurchase or word-of-mouth communication. This represents a sequential, linear model of consumer behavior, guiding a consumer from initial awareness to post-purchase evaluation.",
