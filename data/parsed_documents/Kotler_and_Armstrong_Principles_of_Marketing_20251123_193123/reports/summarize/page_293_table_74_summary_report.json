  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates the distinct lifecycles of Style, Fashion, and Fad, all represented in relation to Sales over Time. Style exhibits a relatively stable sales trajectory, suggesting enduring appeal. Fashion shows a more pronounced but still sustained sales curve, indicating a trend with a longer lifespan. In contrast, Fad demonstrates a rapid and sharp increase in sales, followed by an equally swift decline, highlighting its ephemeral nature. The examples provided, such as the Pet Rock and low-carb diets, exemplify this characteristic short-lived, intense popularity of fads. The visual representation of sales over time, depicted by polylines, clearly differentiates the duration and intensity of these three concepts.",
