  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines various geographical pricing strategies used in business. These strategies address how transportation costs are factored into the final price for customers situated in different locations. FOB-origin pricing places the freight cost responsibility on the customer from the factory onwards. Conversely, uniform-delivered pricing applies a single price plus freight to all customers, irrespective of their distance. Zone pricing categorizes customers into zones, with prices increasing for more distant zones, while all customers within a single zone pay the same total price. Basing-point pricing designates a specific city as a reference point, with all customers charged freight costs from that city. Finally, freight-absorption pricing involves the seller covering some or all of the transportation costs to secure business.",
