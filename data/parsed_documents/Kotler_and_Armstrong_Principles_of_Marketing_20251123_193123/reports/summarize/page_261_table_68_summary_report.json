  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates a three-pronged approach to marketing within a service firm, emphasizing the interconnectedness of internal and external efforts. It highlights **Internal Marketing** focused on employees, **External Marketing** targeting customers, and **Interactive Marketing** as the crucial bridge between the two. Internal marketing underscores the necessity of instilling a customer-centric mindset in employees, exemplified by Zappos.com's core value of \"Deliver WOW through service.\" Interactive marketing then focuses on equipping these employees with the skills to effectively engage with customers, as demonstrated by Zappos.com's comprehensive customer loyalty training for all staff. Ultimately, the structure suggests that successful external marketing, which directly reaches customers, is contingent upon robust internal and interactive marketing strategies that empower and train employees to deliver exceptional service.",
