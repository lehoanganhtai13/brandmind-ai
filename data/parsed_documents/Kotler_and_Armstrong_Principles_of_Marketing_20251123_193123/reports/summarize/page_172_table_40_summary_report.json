  "summary_markdown": "Figure 5.3 illustrates Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, presenting a hierarchical structure of human requirements. At the base are Physiological needs, encompassing hunger and thirst, followed by Safety needs, which include security and protection. Ascending further, Social needs represent the desire for a sense of belonging and love. Above these are Esteem needs, characterized by self-esteem, recognition, and status. Finally, at the apex are Self-actualization needs, relating to self-development and realization. The diagram emphasizes that these needs are arranged in a hierarchy, suggesting that lower-level needs must be met before individuals can focus on higher-level ones, as starving individuals will prioritize basic survival over abstract pursuits.",
