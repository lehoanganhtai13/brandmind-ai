  "summary_markdown": "This diagram illustrates the fundamental constraints and considerations in setting a product's price. The core structure is a range defined by a **price floor**, representing the minimum price at which a company can avoid losses, and a **price ceiling**, beyond which consumer demand ceases. Between these two limits, the optimal pricing strategy is determined by balancing **consumer perceptions of value** against the company's **product costs**. External influences, including **competition and other external factors** such as competitors' strategies and prices, as well as the company's own **marketing strategy, objectives, and mix**, and the **nature of the market and demand**, also play crucial roles in shaping the final price. The ultimate goal is to establish a price that simultaneously offers perceived value to customers and ensures profitability for the company.",
