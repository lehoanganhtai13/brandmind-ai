  "summary_markdown": "This data illustrates a cost-volume-profit analysis framework, presenting a comparative structure of financial elements. It begins with **Fixed costs**, established at $300,000 and independent of sales volume. These are then combined with **Variable costs**, which are directly proportional to sales volume, to determine **Total costs**. The analysis also includes a **Total revenue curve**, which originates at zero and increases with each unit sold, with its slope dictated by a price of $20 per unit. The core relationship depicted is how these cost and revenue components interact to influence profitability based on sales volume.",
