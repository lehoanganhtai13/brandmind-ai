  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two primary categories of sampling methods: Probability Sample and Nonprobability Sample. Probability samples, which ensure every population member has a known and equal chance of selection, include simple random sampling, stratified random sampling (where the population is divided into mutually exclusive groups and samples are drawn from each), and cluster (area) sampling (where groups are selected, and then individuals within those groups are sampled). Nonprobability samples, conversely, do not offer known or equal chances of selection. These include convenience sampling (selecting the easiest members), judgment sampling (selecting members based on researcher's judgment of their suitability), and quota sampling (interviewing a predetermined number of individuals within specific categories). The structure is comparative, differentiating methods based on the randomness and known probability of selection.",
