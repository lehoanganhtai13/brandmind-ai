  "summary_markdown": "Table 15.1 outlines three primary categories of advertising objectives: Informative, Persuasive, and Reminder. Informative advertising focuses on communicating customer value, introducing new products, explaining product functionality, suggesting new uses, announcing price changes, describing services, and correcting misconceptions. Persuasive advertising aims to build brand preference, encourage brand switching, alter perceptions of product value, prompt immediate purchases, foster customer engagement, and cultivate a brand community. Reminder advertising seeks to maintain customer relationships, remind consumers where to purchase, and keep the brand top-of-mind, particularly during off-seasons or when the product might be needed soon. The structure is hierarchical, with the three main objective types branching into specific tactical goals.",
