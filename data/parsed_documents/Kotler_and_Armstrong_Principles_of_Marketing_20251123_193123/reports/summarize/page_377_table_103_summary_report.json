  "summary_markdown": "This diagram illustrates a value chain model, depicting the flow of goods and services from origin to consumption, and importantly, the return flow. The primary flow begins with **Suppliers** providing inputs to the **Company**. The Company then processes these inputs and distributes finished products to **Resellers**. Finally, **Resellers** deliver these products to the end **Customers**. Complementing this forward flow is the concept of **Reverse logistics**, which represents the movement of goods from **Customers** back through **Resellers** and potentially to the **Company** or even back to **Suppliers**, encompassing returns, repairs, or recycling. This structure highlights both the primary operational flow and the critical feedback loop for product lifecycle management.",
