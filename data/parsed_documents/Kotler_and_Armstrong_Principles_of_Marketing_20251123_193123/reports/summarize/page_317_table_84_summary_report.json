  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a direct relationship between sales volume and cost, illustrating a linear cost behavior. The table shows that as sales volume, measured in thousands of units, increases from 0 to 50, the associated cost, expressed in thousands of dollars, also increases proportionally. Specifically, a sales volume of 0 units corresponds to a cost of $0 thousand. For every 10,000 unit increase in sales volume, the cost rises by $200 thousand. This pattern continues up to a sales volume of 50,000 units, which incurs a cost of $1,000 thousand. The final entry indicates a cost of $1,200 thousand without a corresponding sales volume, suggesting a potential outlier or a different cost component not directly tied to the unit sales volume presented. The structure is comparative, highlighting the cost implications at various sales levels.",
