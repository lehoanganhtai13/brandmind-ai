  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates a comparative analysis of old and new logos for several prominent brands, highlighting design evolution. For HERSHEY'S, the transition moved from a more descriptive company name to a simplified brand name and company identifier. Pizza Hut shifted from a literal representation of its iconic red roof to a more abstract circular design with text. Southwest Airlines evolved from bold, all-caps lettering with a jet graphic to a softer, title-case font incorporating a heart symbol. IHOP's logo changed from a blue design with a red banner to a blue wordmark featuring a red smile element. Google underwent a significant transformation, moving from a multicolor serif font to a multicolor sans-serif font, and also introduced a single-letter \"G\" logo in four colors, alongside a favicon-like design of four colored dots and a microphone icon. The overall structure is comparative, showcasing the \"before\" and \"after\" of brand identity redesigns.",
