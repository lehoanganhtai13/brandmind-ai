  "summary_markdown": "Figure 18.2 outlines competitive market positions and their associated roles, illustrating a market structure based on share percentage. The market leader, holding the largest share at 40%, focuses on expanding total demand and defending or increasing its market share. Market challengers, with 30% of the market, aim to attack the leader and gain share. Market followers, holding 20% of the market, are content to maintain their current share and avoid challenging competitors. Finally, market nichers, representing 10% of the market, target specific, profitable segments that are too small to attract major competitors. This structure highlights a hierarchy of market influence, from the dominant leader to specialized nichers, each employing distinct competitive strategies.",
