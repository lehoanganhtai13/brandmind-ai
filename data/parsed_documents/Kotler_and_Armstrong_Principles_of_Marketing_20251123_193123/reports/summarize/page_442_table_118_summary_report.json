  "summary_markdown": "This table contrasts push and pull promotion strategies, illustrating their distinct channel flows. A push strategy involves the producer engaging in marketing activities, such as personal selling and trade promotion, directed at retailers and wholesalers. These intermediaries then \"push\" the product to consumers through their own marketing efforts, including advertising and sales promotion. Conversely, a pull strategy focuses on the producer directly marketing to final consumers through activities like advertising and digital media. This creates consumer demand, which in turn \"pulls\" the product through the channel from retailers and wholesalers back to the producer. The table visually represents these differing directional flows of marketing influence and demand within the distribution channel.",
