  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates public policy issues in pricing across different levels of a distribution channel, specifically focusing on producer, retailer, and consumer interactions. At the producer level, issues include price-fixing and predatory pricing by Producer A and Producer B. Retailer 1 and Retailer 2 also engage in price-fixing and predatory pricing, with Retailer 1 additionally practicing retail price maintenance and discriminatory pricing. Deceptive pricing is noted as a practice at the retailer level, specifically by Retailer 1 and also generally across channel levels. The structure highlights that major public policy pricing issues occur both within individual channel levels and across these levels, ultimately impacting consumers. The diagram emphasizes the prevalence of various problematic pricing strategies throughout the supply chain.",
