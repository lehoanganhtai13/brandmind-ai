  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines four key decisions in developing a branding strategy. Brand positioning focuses on defining the brand's market offering by highlighting its attributes, benefits, and underlying beliefs and values. Brand name selection involves choosing an appropriate name and ensuring its legal protection. Brand sponsorship considers different ownership models, including manufacturer's brands, private brands, licensing agreements, and co-branding partnerships. Finally, brand development explores various growth strategies, such as line extensions, brand extensions, introducing multibrands, or creating entirely new brands. These four areas represent a structured approach to building and managing a brand's identity and market presence.",
