  "summary_markdown": "This figure illustrates a spectrum of marketing targeting strategies, ranging from broad to narrow approaches. At the widest end is undifferentiated (mass) marketing, which involves no specific targeting. Moving towards more focused strategies, differentiated (segmented) marketing targets several market segments. Concentrated (niche) marketing narrows the focus further to a single, specific market segment. Finally, at the narrowest end of the spectrum, micromarketing encompasses both local marketing, which tailors offerings to local customer groups, and individual marketing, which customizes products and programs for individual customers. The overarching structure is a continuum, progressing from a broad market scope to highly individualized customer approaches.",
