But its success lies in doing much more than just selling its products to such customers. Instead, Cargill partners closely them, applying its deep expertise to help customers *use* its products to serve their own customers better and more profitably. For example, Cargill’s researchers keep customers up to date on the latest global consumer food trends. Its research and development teams give customers personalized product development support. And its technical services specialists provide help in resolving customer ingredient and applications challenges. “Whether you need laboratory or pilot work on finished products or help with production start-up,” says the company, “Cargill’s applications experts can assist you—from developing new end-product recipes, achieving better pricing for your products, or getting to market more quickly.” Thus, more than just selling cocoa and chocolate, Cargill sells customer success in using those products. Its goal is to “[apply] our deep chocolate expertise and broad food knowledge…to provide you with more opportunities to grow your business across a wide range of cocoa and chocolate products and applications . . . helping you *thrive*, today and into the future.”⁴\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>",
