  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of pricing and cost components before and after a 10% price reduction. The 'Old' column shows an initial price of $168 with a unit variable cost of $132.72, resulting in a unit contribution of $35.28 and a contribution margin of 21%. The 'New (reduced 10%)' column illustrates the impact of the price decrease, with the new price set at $151.20. Crucially, the unit variable cost remains unchanged at $132.72. This leads to a significantly reduced unit contribution of $18.48 and a corresponding drop in the contribution margin to 12%. The structure highlights the direct relationship between price changes and contribution margin, assuming stable variable costs.",
