  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines four distinct marketing objectives, each focusing on a different facet of the marketing environment. Objective 3-1 examines the broader marketing environment, encompassing its microenvironment and macroenvironment, along with key players like marketing intermediaries, publics, and the general marketing environment itself. Objective 3-2 delves into demographic factors, specifically detailing various generational cohorts such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials (Generation Y), and Generation Z, and also includes the economic environment. Objectives 3-3 and 3-4 shift focus to external environmental influences, with Objective 3-3 covering the natural and technological environments, and Objective 3-4 addressing the political and cultural environments. The structure is comparative, presenting distinct but related areas of environmental analysis for marketing strategy.",
