  "summary_markdown": "Figure 1.3 contrasts the selling concept with the marketing concept, illustrating their differing approaches to business strategy. The selling concept originates from the factory, focusing on existing products and employing selling and promotion as its primary means to achieve profits through high sales volume. In contrast, the marketing concept is market-oriented, with its starting point being the market itself. Its focus lies on understanding and addressing customer needs, utilizing integrated marketing as its means. The ultimate end goal of the marketing concept is to achieve profits through customer satisfaction. This highlights a fundamental shift from a product-centric, push-oriented strategy to a customer-centric, pull-oriented strategy.",
