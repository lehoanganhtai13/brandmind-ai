  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative income statement, detailing the breakdown of Net Sales into various expense categories to arrive at Net Profit Before Income Tax.  Net Sales of $100,000,000, representing 100%, are reduced by the Cost of Goods Sold ($55,000,000 or 55%), yielding a Gross Margin of $45,000,000 (45%). This Gross Margin is then further reduced by Marketing Expenses, totaling $39,000,000 (39%), which encompass Sales expenses, Promotion expenses, and Freight. Following this, General and Administrative Expenses, amounting to $7,000,000 (7%) and including Managerial salaries and expenses and Indirect overhead, are subtracted. The cumulative effect of these deductions results in a Net Profit Before Income Tax of -$1,000,000, a loss of 1% of Net Sales.",
