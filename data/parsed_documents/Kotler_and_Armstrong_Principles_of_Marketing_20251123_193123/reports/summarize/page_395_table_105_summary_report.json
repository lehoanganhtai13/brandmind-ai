  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines different types of retail stores, categorized by their product assortment, pricing strategy, and operational model. Specialty stores focus on a narrow product line with deep selection, exemplified by apparel or bookstore chains. Department stores offer multiple product lines, each managed separately, such as clothing and home furnishings. Supermarkets are large, self-service operations for groceries and household goods, while convenience stores are smaller, accessible locations with limited, high-turnover items. Discount stores offer standard merchandise at lower prices and higher volumes. Off-price retailers, including factory outlets, independent operations, and warehouse clubs, sell goods at reduced wholesale or retail prices. Finally, superstores are expansive, catering to total consumer needs, encompassing supercenters (combining supermarket and discount elements) and category killers with deep assortments in specific product areas.",
