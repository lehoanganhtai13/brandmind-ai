  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative framework, aligning the traditional \"Four Ps\" of marketing with a corresponding set of \"Four As.\" The Four Ps, representing Product, Price, Place, and Promotion, are mapped to the Four As: Acceptability, Affordability, Accessibility, and Awareness, respectively. This structure suggests a customer-centric reinterpretation of marketing strategy, where each \"P\" is viewed through the lens of its corresponding \"A.\" Product is considered in terms of its Acceptability to the target market; Price is evaluated for its Affordability; Place is assessed by its Accessibility to consumers; and Promotion is measured by the level of Awareness it generates. The overarching organization is a direct, one-to-one correspondence, illustrating how fundamental marketing elements can be reframed to emphasize consumer perception and engagement.",
