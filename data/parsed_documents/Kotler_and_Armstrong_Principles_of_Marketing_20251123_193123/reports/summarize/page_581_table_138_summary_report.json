  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines three primary modes of international market entry: Exporting, Joint Venturing, and Direct Investment. Exporting encompasses both indirect and direct methods of selling goods produced domestically in foreign markets. Joint Venturing represents a collaborative approach, involving strategies such as licensing, contract manufacturing, management contracting, and joint ownership, where two or more firms pool resources for a specific project or venture. Direct Investment signifies a higher level of commitment, involving the establishment of wholly-owned operations abroad, specifically through the creation of assembly facilities or full-scale manufacturing facilities. The structure illustrates a progression of increasing commitment and control in international business operations, moving from less involved exporting to more integrated direct investment.",
