  "summary_markdown": "This decision tree outlines a pricing strategy in response to competitor price changes. It begins by assessing whether a competitor has cut their price. If not, the strategy is to hold the current price and continue monitoring. If a competitor has lowered their price, the next step is to evaluate the potential negative impact on market share and profits. If the impact is deemed not significant, the strategy is to reduce the company's own price. However, if the impact is significant, the decision tree branches further to consider if effective action can be taken. If no effective action is feasible, the strategy involves raising perceived value. If effective action is possible, options include improving product quality and increasing price, or launching a low-price \"fighter brand.\" This structure represents a hierarchical, conditional decision-making process for competitive pricing.",
