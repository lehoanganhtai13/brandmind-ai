  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of total contribution based on the involvement of two entities, HD1 and HD2. The structure is comparative, examining two distinct scenarios: \"HD1 only\" and \"HD1 and HD2.\" In the \"HD1 only\" scenario, HD1 contributes 600,000 units at $35 each, totaling $21,000,000, with no contribution from HD2. Conversely, when both HD1 and HD2 are involved, HD1's contribution is reduced to 400,000 units at $35 each, amounting to $14,000,000. Simultaneously, HD2 contributes 700,000 units at $20 each, also totaling $14,000,000. The combined total contribution in the \"HD1 and HD2\" scenario is $28,000,000, which is higher than the $21,000,000 generated by HD1 alone.",
