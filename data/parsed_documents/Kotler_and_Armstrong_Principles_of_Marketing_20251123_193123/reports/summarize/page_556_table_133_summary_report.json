  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines four distinct market strategies: Market Leader, Market Challenger, Market Follower, and Market Nicher. Market Leaders focus on expanding the total market, protecting their existing market share, and increasing their overall market share. Market Challengers employ more aggressive tactics, including full frontal attacks and indirect attacks, to gain ground. Market Followers adopt a more cautious approach, either following closely or at a distance, without initiating direct competition. Market Nichers concentrate on specific segments, differentiating their offerings by customer type, market segment, quality, price, or service, and may pursue multiple niching strategies. The structure is comparative, presenting distinct strategic approaches for firms operating in different market positions.",
