  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines marketing considerations for four types of consumer products: Convenience, Shopping, Specialty, and Unsought.  Customer buying behavior varies significantly, from frequent, low-involvement purchases of convenience goods to the strong brand loyalty and special effort required for specialty items, with shopping goods falling in between and unsought goods characterized by low awareness or interest.  Pricing generally increases from convenience to specialty products, while distribution becomes more selective, moving from widespread to exclusive. Promotion strategies also adapt, employing mass promotion for convenience goods, a mix of advertising and personal selling for shopping and specialty items, and aggressive tactics for unsought products. Examples provided illustrate these distinctions, ranging from everyday items like toothpaste to luxury goods and essential services.",
