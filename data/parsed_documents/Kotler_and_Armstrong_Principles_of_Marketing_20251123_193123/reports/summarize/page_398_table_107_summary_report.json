  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines different types of retail organizations, categorized by their ownership and control structures. Corporate chains represent multiple outlets under common ownership, prevalent in sectors like department stores, discount stores, and grocery stores, with examples including Macy's and Target. Voluntary chains are wholesaler-sponsored alliances of independent retailers focused on collective purchasing and merchandising, such as Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA). Retailer cooperatives are similar, comprising independent retailers who jointly manage a central buying organization and promotional activities, exemplified by Associated Grocers and Ace Hardware. Finally, franchise organizations are contractual agreements where independent franchisees acquire the rights to operate units within a larger system, as seen with McDonald's and 7-Eleven. The overarching structure is comparative, differentiating these retail models based on their degree of centralization and independence.",
