There are full-service wholesalers and limited-service wholesalers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full-service wholesalers</td>\n<td>Provide a full line of services: carrying stock, maintaining a sales force, offering credit, making deliveries, and providing management assistance. Full-service wholesalers include wholesale merchants and industrial distributors.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Wholesale merchants</i></td>\n<td>Sell primarily to retailers and provide a full range of services. General merchandise wholesalers carry several merchandise lines, whereas general line wholesalers carry one or two lines in great depth. Specialty wholesalers specialize in carrying only part of a line.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Industrial distributors</i></td>\n<td>Sell to manufacturers rather than to retailers. Provide several services, such as carrying stock, offering credit, and providing delivery. May carry a broad range of merchandise, a general line, or a specialty line.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Limited-service wholesalers</td>\n<td>Offer fewer services than full-service wholesalers. Limited-service wholesalers are of several types:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Cash-and-carry wholesalers</i></td>\n<td>Carry a limited line of fast-moving goods and sell to small retailers for cash. Normally do not deliver.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Truck wholesalers (or truck jobbers)</i></td>\n<td>Perform primarily a selling and delivery function. Carry a limited line of semiperishable merchandise (such as milk, bread, snack foods), which is sold for cash as deliveries are made to supermarkets, small groceries, hospitals, restaurants, factory cafeterias, and hotels.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Drop shippers</i></td>\n<td>Do not carry inventory or handle the product. On receiving an order, drop shippers select a manufacturer, who then ships the merchandise directly to the customer. Drop shippers operate in bulk industries, such as coal, lumber, and heavy equipment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Rack jobbers</i></td>\n<td>Serve grocery and drug retailers, mostly in nonfood items. Rack jobbers send delivery trucks to stores, where the delivery people set up toys, paperbacks, hardware items, health and beauty aids, or other items. Rack jobbers price the goods, keep them fresh, set up point-of-purchase displays, and keep inventory records.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Producers’ cooperatives</i></td>\n<td>Farmer-owned members that assemble farm produce for sale in local markets. Producers’ cooperatives often attempt to improve product quality and promote a co-op brand name, such as Sun-Maid raisins, Sunkist oranges, or Diamond nuts.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Mail-order or web wholesalers</i></td>\n<td>Send catalogs to or maintain websites for retail, industrial, and institutional customers featuring jewelry, cosmetics, specialty foods, and other small items. Its primary customers are businesses in small outlying areas.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Brokers and agents</b></td>\n<td>Do not take title to goods. The main function is to facilitate buying and selling, for which they earn a commission on the selling price. Generally specialize by product line or customer type.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brokers</td>\n<td>Bring buyers and sellers together and assist in negotiation. Brokers are paid by the party who hired the broker and do not carry inventory, get involved in financing, or assume risk. Examples include food brokers, real estate brokers, insurance brokers, and security brokers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Agents</td>\n<td>Represent either buyers or sellers on a more permanent basis than brokers do. There are four types:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Manufacturers’ agents</i></td>\n<td>Represent two or more manufacturers of complementary lines. Often used in such lines as apparel, furniture, and electrical goods. A manufacturer’s agent is hired by small manufacturers who cannot afford their own field sales forces and by large manufacturers who use agents to open new territories or cover territories that cannot support full-time salespeople.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><i>Selling agents</i></td>\n<td>Have contractual authority to sell a manufacturer’s entire output. The selling agent serves as a sales department and has significant influence over prices, terms, and conditions of sale. Found in product areas such as textiles, industrial machinery and equipment, coal and coke, chemicals, and metals.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two primary types of intermediaries: Merchant Wholesalers and Brokers and Agents, distinguished by whether they take title to merchandise. Merchant wholesalers, which are independently owned and take title, are further divided into full-service and limited-service categories. Full-service wholesalers offer a comprehensive suite of services including stock carrying, sales force maintenance, credit, delivery, and management assistance, encompassing wholesale merchants (selling to retailers) and industrial distributors (selling to manufacturers). Limited-service wholesalers provide fewer services and include types such as cash-and-carry, truck, drop shippers, rack jobbers, producers' cooperatives, and mail-order/web wholesalers. Brokers and agents, conversely, do not take title to goods; their primary role is to facilitate transactions for a commission. Brokers bring buyers and sellers together for negotiation, while agents represent buyers or sellers more permanently, with specific types including manufacturers' agents and selling agents who manage a manufacturer's sales.",
