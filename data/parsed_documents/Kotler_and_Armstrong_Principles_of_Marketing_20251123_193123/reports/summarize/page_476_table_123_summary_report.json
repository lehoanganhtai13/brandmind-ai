  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of different banner ad types and their associated costs, specifically measured in Cost Per Mille (CPM), which represents the cost per thousand impressions. The structure is a simple categorization of banner types against their pricing. The types of banners include Standard banner, Leaderboard banner, Skyscraper banner, and Space banner. Each of these banner types has a distinct CPM cost: Standard banners are priced at $25 CPM, Leaderboard banners at $40 CPM, Skyscraper banners at $35 CPM, and Space banners at the highest cost of $50 CPM. This indicates a direct relationship between the banner type and its associated advertising expense, with Space banners being the most expensive and Standard banners the least expensive among those listed.",
