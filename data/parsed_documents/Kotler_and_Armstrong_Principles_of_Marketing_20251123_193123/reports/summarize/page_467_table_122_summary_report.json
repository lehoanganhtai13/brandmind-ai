  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of various advertising media, outlining their respective advantages and limitations. The structure is comparative, evaluating each medium across key attributes. Television offers broad reach and sensory appeal but suffers from high costs and clutter. Digital, mobile, and social media provide selectivity and engagement at a lower cost, though impact can be limited by audience control. Newspapers are flexible and timely with good local coverage and believability, but have a short lifespan and poor reproduction. Direct mail excels in selectivity and personalization but incurs higher costs per exposure and can be perceived as junk mail. Magazines offer strong selectivity, credibility, and reproduction quality, but require long lead times and are expensive. Radio is cost-effective for local markets with good selectivity but is audio-only and prone to fleeting exposure. Finally, outdoor advertising is flexible, cost-effective with high repeat exposure, but lacks audience selectivity and has creative limitations.",
