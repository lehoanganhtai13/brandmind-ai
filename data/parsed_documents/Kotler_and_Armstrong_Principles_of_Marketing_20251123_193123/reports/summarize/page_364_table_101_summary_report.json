  "summary_markdown": "This table contrasts conventional marketing channels with vertical marketing systems, illustrating their structural differences. In a conventional channel, the flow is linear: a Producer sells to a Wholesaler, who then sells to a Retailer, and finally to the Consumer. This represents a series of independent entities operating sequentially. In contrast, a vertical marketing system, as depicted, shows a more integrated structure where a Producer might directly engage with a Wholesaler, who in turn works with a Retailer. The key distinction lies in the coordinated efforts within a vertical system, aiming for greater efficiency and control compared to the fragmented nature of conventional channels. The red highlighting on \"Retailer\" within the vertical system suggests a potential point of emphasis or a specific type of integration being illustrated.",
