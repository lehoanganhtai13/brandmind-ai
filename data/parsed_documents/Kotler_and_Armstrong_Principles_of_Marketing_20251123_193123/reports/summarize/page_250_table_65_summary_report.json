  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a sequential, linear process for developing and presenting a product, moving from its intrinsic characteristics to its external presentation and post-purchase experience. The process begins with defining core **Product attributes**, which then inform the creation of a **Branding** strategy. This branding is subsequently translated into the **Packaging** design. Following packaging, **Labeling and logos** are applied, serving as key visual identifiers. Finally, the product offering is augmented by **Product support services**, completing the comprehensive product development and marketing framework. The arrows indicate a clear progression, suggesting that each stage builds upon the decisions made in the preceding one.",
