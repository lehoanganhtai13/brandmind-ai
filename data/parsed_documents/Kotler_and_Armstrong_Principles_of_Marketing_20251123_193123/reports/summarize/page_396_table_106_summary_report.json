  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines different types of retail operations, categorized by their product assortment, size, and operational strategy. Convenience stores are characterized by their small size, proximity to residential areas, extended operating hours, and limited selection of high-turnover goods. In contrast, superstores are significantly larger, offering a broad range of both food and nonfood items, alongside services. Category killers are defined by their immense size and deep specialization within a particular product category. Service retailers, as their name suggests, primarily offer services rather than physical goods, with examples spanning hospitality, finance, and education. Finally, discount stores focus on selling standard merchandise at reduced prices, achieving profitability through high sales volume and lower profit margins. The overarching structure is a classification of retail formats based on distinct business models and offerings.",
