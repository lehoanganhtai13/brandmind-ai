  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a sequential process for new product development, beginning with **Idea generation** and progressing through several distinct stages. Following idea generation, **Idea screening** serves to filter and select promising concepts. The selected ideas then move to **Concept development and testing**, where they are refined and evaluated with potential customers. Subsequently, **Marketing strategy development** focuses on planning how to bring the product to market. The process continues with **Business analysis**, which assesses the financial viability of the product. This leads to **Product development**, the actual creation of the product. **Test marketing** then involves a trial launch in a limited market to gauge consumer response and refine the strategy. Finally, the process culminates in **Commercialization**, the full-scale introduction of the product to the market. The structure is linear and progressive, with each stage building upon the outcomes of the previous one.",
