  "summary_markdown": "This marketing plan structure is organized hierarchically, moving from broad situational analysis to specific action and control mechanisms. It begins with an **Executive summary** (purpose not detailed in the provided text), followed by a comprehensive **Current marketing situation** analysis that describes the target market and company position, encompassing market description, product review, competition assessment, and distribution channel evaluation. Next, a **Threats and opportunities analysis** identifies potential external impacts on the product. The plan then defines **Objectives and issues**, stating desired marketing goals and discussing factors influencing their achievement. The core **Marketing strategy** section outlines the overarching logic for customer engagement, value creation, and relationship building, detailing target markets, positioning, and marketing expenditure, and aligning with identified threats, opportunities, and issues. This is followed by **Action programs**, which specify the \"what, when, who, and how much\" of strategy implementation. A detailed **Budgets** section projects revenues and costs, serving as a basis for operational planning. Finally, **Controls** are outlined to monitor progress, review results, and measure marketing investment returns.",
