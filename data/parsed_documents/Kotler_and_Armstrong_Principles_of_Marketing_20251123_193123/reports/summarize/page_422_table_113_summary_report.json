  "summary_markdown": "This table presents two distinct questions related to retail and marketing. The first question, 13-23, probes the concept of \"retail convergence,\" asking for its definition and an assessment of its impact, specifically whether it has benefited or disadvantaged small retailers. The second question, 13-24, shifts focus to the physical aspects of retail, requesting a description of different types of shopping centers and the identification of local or regional examples. The text accompanying question 13-24 also provides context, indicating that the subsequent three chapters will delve into the \"promotion\" element of the marketing mix.",
