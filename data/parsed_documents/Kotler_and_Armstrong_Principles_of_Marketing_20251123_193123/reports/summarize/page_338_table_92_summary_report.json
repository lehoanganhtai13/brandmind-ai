  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two key concepts related to pricing strategy: Psychological pricing and Reference prices. Psychological pricing focuses on leveraging the psychological impact of prices, using them to convey specific messages about a product beyond its economic value. This approach is closely linked to Reference prices, which are the internal benchmarks or expectations consumers hold for a product's price. When evaluating a product, buyers compare its listed price against these mental reference points, influencing their perception of value and their purchasing decisions. Essentially, psychological pricing aims to manipulate or align with these reference prices to achieve desired market outcomes.",
