  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a hierarchical strategic planning framework, starting at the corporate level and cascading down to business units. At the highest corporate level, strategy is defined by three key components: establishing the company mission, setting overarching company objectives and goals, and designing the overall business portfolio. These corporate-level decisions then inform and guide the strategy and planning at the business unit, product, and market level. A crucial overarching principle is that the broader company strategy, much like marketing strategy, must be customer-focused. This customer-centric approach ensures alignment and relevance across all levels of strategic planning within the organization.",
