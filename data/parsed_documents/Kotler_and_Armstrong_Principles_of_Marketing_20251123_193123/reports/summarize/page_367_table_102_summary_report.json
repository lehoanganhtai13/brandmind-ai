Direct sales can occur through catalogs, online platforms, and mobile interfaces. Additionally, the producer employs intermediaries such as retailers and specialized dealers. These dealers can be further categorized into premium full-service dealers, catering to large farm or forestry businesses, and neighborhood dealers, serving individual consumers. The sales force plays a crucial role across these channels, interacting with both consumer segments and business segments, which are themselves divided into distinct categories.
