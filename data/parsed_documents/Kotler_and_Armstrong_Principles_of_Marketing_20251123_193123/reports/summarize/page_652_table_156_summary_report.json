  "summary_markdown": "This data illustrates a cost breakdown for a product, demonstrating a sequential reduction in price through different distribution channels. It begins with the initial Retail price of $250. A Retail margin of 30% is then subtracted, resulting in a reduction of $75. This leads to the Retailer’s cost, which is also identified as the Wholesaler’s price, standing at $175. Subsequently, a Wholesaler’s margin of 20% is applied, subtracting $35 from the price. The final figure presented is the Wholesaler’s cost, also termed HD’s price, which is $140. The structure is comparative, showing how the price is successively lowered by margins at each stage of the supply chain.",
