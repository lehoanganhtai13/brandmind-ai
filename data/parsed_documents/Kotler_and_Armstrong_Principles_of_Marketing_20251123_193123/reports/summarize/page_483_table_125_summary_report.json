  "summary_markdown": "Figure 16.1 outlines the major steps involved in sales force management, presenting a sequential, process-based structure. The process begins with designing the overall sales force strategy and structure. This is followed by the crucial steps of recruiting and selecting appropriate individuals for the sales team. Once recruited, salespeople undergo training to equip them with necessary skills and knowledge. Subsequently, a compensation system is established to incentivize and reward performance. The management process continues with supervising salespeople to ensure adherence to strategies and provide ongoing support. Finally, the cycle concludes with the evaluation of salespeople, likely to assess performance against objectives and inform future strategic decisions.",
