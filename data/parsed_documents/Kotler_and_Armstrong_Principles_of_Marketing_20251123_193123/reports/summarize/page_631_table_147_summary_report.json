  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a product's strategy for targeting distinct customer segments, detailing their specific needs and the corresponding features or benefits offered. For athletes, the focus is on hydration and energy, met by electrolytes, carbohydrates, and B vitamins. Health-conscious individuals seek weight management, optimal nutrition, and natural ingredients, addressed by lower calorie counts, higher vitamin and mineral content, all-natural components, and diverse flavors. Socially conscious consumers are motivated by supporting charitable causes, with the product contributing a donation to Vitamin Angels per purchase. Millennials, characterized by a distrust of mass media and a fast-paced lifestyle, are targeted through less invasive online promotions, the company's private ownership status, and comprehensive vitamin and mineral content for diet enhancement. The structure is comparative, mapping segment-specific needs to tailored product attributes.",
