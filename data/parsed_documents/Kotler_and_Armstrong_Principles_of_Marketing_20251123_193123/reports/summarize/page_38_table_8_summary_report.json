  "summary_markdown": "The societal marketing concept is depicted as a framework integrating three key stakeholders: Consumers, the Company, and Society. Consumers are driven by their want satisfaction, while the Company aims for profits. Society's interests are represented by human welfare. The overarching societal marketing concept acts as a central integrating element, mediating the relationship between these three components. This structure suggests a balanced approach where consumer needs and company objectives are pursued in a manner that also considers and promotes the well-being of society. The diagram illustrates a multi-faceted consideration beyond simple buyer-seller exchanges, emphasizing a broader societal impact.",
