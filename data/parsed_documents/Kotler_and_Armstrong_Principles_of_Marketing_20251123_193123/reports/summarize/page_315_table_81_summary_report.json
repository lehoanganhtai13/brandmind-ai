  "summary_markdown": "This data illustrates a cost-volume relationship, specifically demonstrating how the cost per unit decreases as accumulated production increases. The structure is comparative, showing discrete production levels and their corresponding unit costs. Starting at a production of 100,000 units with a cost of $10 per unit, the cost per unit halves with each doubling of accumulated production. This trend continues through 200,000 units ($8/unit) and 400,000 units ($6/unit), reaching 800,000 units at a cost of $4 per unit. The final entry indicates a cost of $2 per unit with no specified accumulated production, suggesting a potential extrapolation or a further point in this decreasing cost trend. The overall pattern highlights economies of scale, where higher production volumes lead to lower per-unit expenses.",
