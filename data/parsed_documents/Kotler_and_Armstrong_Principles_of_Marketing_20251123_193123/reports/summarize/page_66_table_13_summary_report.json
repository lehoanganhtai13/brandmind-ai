  "summary_markdown": "This table contrasts product-oriented definitions with market-oriented definitions for several companies, illustrating a shift from focusing on what a company *sells* to the broader *value* it provides to customers and society. Product-oriented definitions are direct and functional, such as Chipotle selling \"burritos and other Mexican food\" or Facebook being an \"online social network.\" In contrast, market-oriented definitions emphasize customer benefits, aspirations, and experiences. For instance, Chipotle offers \"Food With Integrity,\" Facebook \"connect[s] people around the world,\" and Home Depot empowers consumers to \"achieve the homes of their dreams.\" This structure highlights how companies can redefine their purpose from tangible goods or services to intangible benefits like lifestyle, self-expression, experiences, or even societal impact, as seen with NASA's mission to \"benefit all humankind.\"",
