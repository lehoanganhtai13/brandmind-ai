  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates the Ansoff Matrix, a strategic framework for product and market growth. It categorizes growth strategies based on whether they involve existing or new products and existing or new markets. The four strategies presented are: Market Penetration, which focuses on increasing market share with existing products in existing markets; Product Development, involving the creation of new products for existing markets; Market Development, which entails entering new markets with existing products; and Diversification, representing the most significant risk, involving new products in new markets. The matrix provides a structured approach to understanding the strategic options available to businesses for expansion.",
