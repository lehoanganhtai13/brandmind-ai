  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a six-stage decision process for global marketing. It begins with an initial assessment of the global marketing environment, followed by a strategic decision on whether to pursue global expansion. Subsequently, the process involves identifying and selecting specific foreign markets for entry. Once target markets are chosen, the next step is to determine the most appropriate mode of market entry. This is followed by the development of the global marketing program, encompassing product, price, place, and promotion strategies tailored for international markets. The final stage involves establishing the global marketing organization, defining its structure and operational framework to manage international marketing activities effectively. This structured approach guides businesses through the complexities of international market engagement.",
