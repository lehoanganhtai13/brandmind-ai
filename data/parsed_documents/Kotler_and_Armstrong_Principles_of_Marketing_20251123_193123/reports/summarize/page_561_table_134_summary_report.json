  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a framework for understanding different market orientations based on two dimensions: customer-centeredness and competitor-centeredness. The structure is a 2x2 matrix, categorizing orientations into four distinct types. When a company is not customer-centered and not competitor-centered, it exhibits a product orientation, focusing primarily on its offerings. If a company is not customer-centered but is competitor-centered, it adopts a competitor orientation, emphasizing rivals' actions. Conversely, a company that is customer-centered but not competitor-centered demonstrates a customer orientation, prioritizing customer needs and satisfaction. Finally, when a company is both customer-centered and competitor-centered, it achieves a market orientation, integrating insights from both customers and competitors to guide its strategies. This matrix highlights how the interplay of these two focus areas defines a company's strategic approach to the market.",
