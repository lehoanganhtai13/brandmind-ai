  "summary_markdown": "This data outlines a cost breakdown, illustrating a hierarchical price reduction from suggested retail price to the manufacturer's (HD's) price. It begins with a suggested retail price of $300, from which a 30% retail margin of $90 is subtracted, resulting in a retailer's cost or wholesaler's price of $210. This wholesaler's price is then reduced by a 20% wholesaler's margin of $42. The final figure presented is the wholesaler's cost, which is also identified as HD's price, calculated at $168. The structure is comparative, showing how each successive margin reduces the overall price down the supply chain.",
