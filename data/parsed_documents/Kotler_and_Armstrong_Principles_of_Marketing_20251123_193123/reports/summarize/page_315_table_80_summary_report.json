  "summary_markdown": "This figure illustrates cost behavior at different production levels, distinguishing between short-run and long-run perspectives. Panel A depicts the Short-Run Average Cost (SRAC) curve within a fixed-size plant, showing that cost per unit initially decreases with increased production up to 1,000 units, after which it begins to rise. This U-shaped curve reflects economies and diseconomies of scale within a single plant's operational constraints. Panel B expands this view to the long run, presenting multiple SRAC curves, each representing a different plant size. The Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve is shown as the lower envelope of these SRAC curves, illustrating the optimal plant size for each output level. The LRAC curve demonstrates that in the long run, firms can adjust plant size to achieve lower average costs, with costs per unit decreasing as output increases up to a certain point, after which they may rise due to factors like management complexity. The overarching message is that understanding these cost curves is crucial for effective pricing strategies.",
