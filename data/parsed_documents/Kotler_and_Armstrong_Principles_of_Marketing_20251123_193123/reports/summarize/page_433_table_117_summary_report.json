  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates a hierarchical progression of consumer engagement, moving from initial **Awareness** to a final **Purchase**. The stages represent a funnel, where consumers gradually move through distinct levels of interaction and commitment. Following **Awareness**, consumers develop **Knowledge** about a product or brand. This knowledge then influences their **Liking**, leading to a **Preference** over alternatives. A stronger **Preference** can evolve into **Conviction**, a firm belief in the product's superiority. Ultimately, this conviction is intended to culminate in the desired **Purchase**. Each stage builds upon the previous one, signifying an increasing level of consumer involvement and a reduced likelihood of dropping out of the funnel.",
