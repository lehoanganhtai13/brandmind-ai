  "summary_markdown": "This content outlines the four major steps involved in designing a customer value-driven marketing strategy. These steps, presented in a sequential manner, begin with **market segmentation**, which involves dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers with different needs, characteristics, or behaviors. Following segmentation is **targeting**, where the company evaluates each market segment's attractiveness and selects one or more segments to enter. The third step is **differentiation**, which focuses on creating superior customer value by actually differentiating the market offering to create superior customer value. Finally, the strategy culminates in **positioning**, where the company positions its market offering in the minds of target consumers so that it stands out relative to competing offerings. Together, these four steps form a structured approach to developing an effective marketing strategy.",
