  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a progression from \"Today: Greening\" to \"Tomorrow: Beyond Greening,\" differentiating internal and external strategies. Under \"Today: Greening,\" internal efforts focus on \"Pollution prevention\" through waste reduction, while external efforts involve \"Product stewardship,\" aiming to minimize environmental impact across a product's life cycle. Transitioning to \"Tomorrow: Beyond Greening,\" internal strategies evolve to developing \"New clean technology,\" fostering novel environmental skills. Externally, the focus shifts to a \"Sustainability vision,\" establishing a strategic framework for generating sustainable value. This structure illustrates a conceptual evolution from reactive environmental management to proactive, strategic integration of sustainability.",
