  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates the Diffusion of Innovations theory, depicting a population's adoption rate of new ideas or technologies over time. The structure is hierarchical, progressing from the earliest adopters to the latest. At the apex are the **Innovators**, representing a small 2.5% of the population who are eager to try new things. Following them are the **Early adopters** (13.5%), influential individuals who adopt early and are respected opinion leaders. Next are the **Early mainstream** (34%), who adopt new ideas just before the average person. This group is followed by the **Late mainstream** (34%), who are skeptical and adopt only after the majority has. Finally, the largest remaining segment, **Laggards** (16%), are traditionalists who are highly skeptical of change and adopt innovations last, if at all. This distribution forms a bell curve, showing a gradual adoption process across different societal segments.",
