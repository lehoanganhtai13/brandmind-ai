  "summary_markdown": "The Business Buyer Decision Process, as depicted in Figure 6.3, outlines a sequential flow of eight stages typically encountered by buyers in complex purchasing situations. This process begins with Problem Recognition, leading to a General Need Description, and then a detailed Product Specification. Subsequently, buyers engage in Supplier Search, followed by Proposal Solicitation from potential vendors. The core of the process involves Supplier Selection, after which an Order-Routine Specification is established. The cycle concludes with a Performance Review of the chosen supplier and product. While this diagram presents a linear progression, it's noted that buyers making rebuys may bypass certain stages, and the actual process is often more intricate than this simplified model suggests.",
