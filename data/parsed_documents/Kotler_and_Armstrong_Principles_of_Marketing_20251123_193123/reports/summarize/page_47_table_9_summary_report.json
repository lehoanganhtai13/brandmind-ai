  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a framework for categorizing customer loyalty based on two dimensions: potential profitability and projected loyalty duration. The structure is a 2x2 matrix, illustrating four distinct customer segments. High potential profitability combined with short-term projected loyalty characterizes \"Butterflies,\" while high profitability and long-term loyalty define \"True friends.\" Conversely, low potential profitability coupled with short-term loyalty results in \"Strangers,\" and low profitability with long-term loyalty identifies \"Barnacles.\" This model visually maps customer relationships, suggesting strategic approaches may differ based on a customer's profitability and expected duration of engagement.",
