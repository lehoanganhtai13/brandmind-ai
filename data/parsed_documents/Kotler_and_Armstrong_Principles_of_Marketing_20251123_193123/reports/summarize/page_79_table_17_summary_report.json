  "summary_markdown": "Figure 2.5 illustrates the Four Ps of the Marketing Mix, a framework of tactical marketing tools designed to engage target customers and deliver intended customer value. The four core components are Product, Price, Promotion, and Place. Product encompasses aspects such as variety, quality, design, features, brand name, packaging, and services. Price includes list price, discounts, allowances, payment periods, and credit terms. Promotion comprises advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, and direct and digital marketing efforts. Place involves channels, coverage, locations, inventory, transportation, and logistics. The overarching goal of these integrated elements is to achieve target customer engagement and establish intended positioning.",
