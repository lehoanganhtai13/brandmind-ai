# Steps in Developing Effective Marketing Communication

Marketers must do the following: identify the target audience, determine the communication objectives, design a message, choose the media through which to send the message, select the message source, and collect feedback.

## Identifying the Target Audience

A marketing communicator starts with a clear target audience in mind. The audience may be current users or potential buyers, those who make the buying decision or those who influence it. The audience may be individuals, groups, special publics, or the general public. The target audience will heavily affect the communicator’s decisions on *what* will be said, *how* it will be said, *when* it will be said, *where* it will be said, and *who* will say it.

## Determining the Communication Objectives

Once the target audience has been defined, marketers must determine the desired response. Of course, in many cases, they will seek a *purchase* response. But purchase may result only after a lengthy consumer decision-making process. The marketing communicator needs to know where the target audience now stands and to what stage it needs to be moved. The target audience may be in any of six **buyer-readiness stages**, the stages consumers normally pass through on their way to making a purchase. These stages are *awareness*, *knowledge*, *liking*, *preference*, *conviction*, and *purchase* (see Figure 14.3).

The marketing communicator’s target market may be totally unaware of the product, know only its name, or know only a few things about it. Thus, the marketer must first build *awareness* and *knowledge*. For example, General Mills recently announced that it was removing artificial flavors and colors from its popular BigG cereals—such as Trix, Cocoa Puffs, Cap’n Crunch, and Golden Grahams. To make consumers aware of these and other changes, General Mills launched a major “Love Cereal Again” campaign:

> Although cereal remains the most-consumed in-home breakfast food, cereal sales have flattened recently as consumers have searched for healthier and more convenient alternatives. The “Love Cereal Again” campaign reintroduces the reformulated BigG cereals as something

> **Author Comment:** Now that we understand how communication works, it’s time to turn all of those promotion mix elements into an actual marketing communications program.

> **Buyer-readiness stages**  
> The stages consumers normally pass through on their way to a purchase: awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction, and, finally, the actual purchase.

> **A goal of marketing in general, and of marketing communications in particular, is to move target customers through the buying process. Once again, it all starts with understanding customer needs and wants.**

This table illustrates a hierarchical progression of consumer engagement, moving from initial **Awareness** to a final **Purchase**. The stages represent a funnel, where consumers gradually move through distinct levels of interaction and commitment. Following **Awareness**, consumers develop **Knowledge** about a product or brand. This knowledge then influences their **Liking**, leading to a **Preference** over alternatives. A stronger **Preference** can evolve into **Conviction**, a firm belief in the product's superiority. Ultimately, this conviction is intended to culminate in the desired **Purchase**. Each stage builds upon the previous one, signifying an increasing level of consumer involvement and a reduced likelihood of dropping out of the funnel.
