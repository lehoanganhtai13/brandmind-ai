# Chapter 3 | Analyzing the Marketing Environment

Diversity goes beyond ethnic heritage. For example, many major companies explicitly target gay and lesbian consumers. According to one estimate, the 6 to 7 percent of U.S. adults who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) have buying power of more than $884 billion. As a result of TV shows such as *Modern Family*, *Transparent*, and *Gotham*; movies like *Brokeback Mountain* and *Carol*; and openly gay celebrities and public figures such as Neil Patrick Harris, Ellen DeGeneres, David Sedaris, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, the LGBT community has increasingly emerged in the public eye.

Brands in a wide range of industries are now targeting the LGBT community with gay-specific ads and marketing efforts—from Amazon, adidas, Allstate, and Apple to Kaiser Permanente, Wells Fargo, Macy’s, and Best Buy. For example, Allstate recently ran an “Everyone deserves to be in good hands” campaign with ads featuring same-sex couples and the hashtag #OutHoldingHands. Last Valentine’s Day, adidas posted an image on Instagram featuring a same-sex couple and quoting the Beatles’ “The Love You Take Is Equal to the Love You Make.” Macy’s and Best Buy run regular ads for their wedding registries featuring same-sex couples. And Frito-Lay launched a limited-edition Doritos Rainbows, multi-colored chips demonstrating the brand’s “expression of inclusion and support for individuality.”

Wells Fargo recently became one of the first banks to feature an LGBT couple in a national TV ad campaign. The heartwarming commercial, featuring a lesbian couple adopting a deaf child, is part of a nine-commercial series that also spotlights other diverse customer groups ranging from Asian Americans to small business owners. Says a Wells Fargo representative, 

> “We…embrace diversity in every aspect, internally and externally. Diversity and inclusion is something we live internally very strongly. This [campaign] is a very important and natural progression of [that value] in how we serve our customers.”

Another attractive diversity segment is the 53 million U.S. adults with disabilities—a market larger than African Americans or Hispanics—representing anywhere from $200 to $500 billion in annual spending power. Most individuals with disabilities are active consumers. For example, one study found that the segment spends $17.3 billion on 73 million business or leisure trips every year. And because people with disabilities typically travel with one or more other adults, the economic impact is estimated to be at least double that amount.

How are companies trying to reach consumers with disabilities? Many marketers now recognize that the worlds of people with disabilities and those without disabilities are one in the same. Marketers such as McDonald’s, Verizon Wireless, Nike, Samsung, Nordstrom, Toyota, and Apple have featured people with disabilities in their mainstream marketing. For instance, a recent Apple iPad Air commercial features real-life travel writer Chérie King traveling the world with her iPad Air in hand, helping her along as she travels through diverse global settings. She communicates back home, posts photos, writes articles, and lets her iPad translate what she wants to say to shopkeepers and others who don’t speak English. Only at the very end of the commercial is her disability revealed—she is deaf.

As the population in the United States grows more diverse, successful marketers will continue to diversify their marketing programs to take advantage of opportunities in fast-growing segments.

## The Economic Environment

Markets require buying power as well as people. The **economic environment** consists of economic factors that affect consumer purchasing power and spending patterns. Economic factors can have a dramatic effect on consumer spending and buying behavior. For example, until fairly recently, American consumers spent freely, fueled by income growth, a boom in the stock market, rapid increases in housing values, and other economic good fortunes. They bought and bought, seemingly without caution, amassing record levels of debt. However, the free spending and high expectations of those days were dashed by the Great Recession of 2008–2009.

As a result, as discussed in Chapter 1, consumers have now adopted a back-to-basics sensibility in their lifestyles and spending patterns that will likely persist for years to come. They are buying less and looking for greater value in the things they do buy. In turn, *value marketing* has become the watchword for many marketers. Marketers in all industries are looking for ways to offer today’s more financially frugal buyers greater value—just the right combination of product quality and good service at a fair price.
