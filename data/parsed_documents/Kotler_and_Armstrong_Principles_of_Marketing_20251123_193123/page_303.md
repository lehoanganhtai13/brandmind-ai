# Marketing by the Numbers  
## Dental House Calls

The Blende Dental Group has taken its service on the road in San Francisco and New York City, performing everything from routine exams and cleanings to root canals. Some patients are wealthy and prefer the personal service, whereas others are elderly homebounds who cannot get out to the dentist’s office. Recreating a dental office in a home requires additional equipment, such as a portable X-ray machine that looks like a ray gun, sterile water tanks, a dental drill, lights, and a laptop. A portable X-ray machine alone costs $8,000. Refer to Appendix 2: Marketing by the Numbers to answer the following questions.

**9-13**  
What types of fixed costs are associated with this service? Estimate total fixed costs for this additional service, and assuming a contribution margin of 40 percent, determine the amount of sales necessary to break even on this increase in fixed costs to offer this additional service.

## Day2Night Convertible Heels

Many women love the fashionable looks and heightening effects of high-heeled shoes. But every woman knows the problems associated with wearing them. For example, they are very uncomfortable for anything more than light walking for short distances. For other activities, you’d better be packing a second pair of shoes.  
That’s where Day2Night Convertible Heels comes in. Created by a woman who had an epiphany after a hard night of dancing, Day2Night’s shoes instantly convert to any one of four heel sizes, from low-heeled pumps to spiked-heeled stilettos. An interchangeable heel makes these high heels a high-tech proposition.

Beyond launching a line of shoes, Day2Night is looking to license the technology to other shoe manufacturers.  
After viewing the video featuring Day2Night Convertible Heels, answer the following questions:

**9-15**  
Based on the stages of new product development, discuss how Day2Night was likely developed.

**9-16**  
What stage of the product life cycle best applies to Day2Night’s shoe line? As the company attempts to launch the shoes, how should it market them?

**9-17**  
What challenges does Day2Night face?

# Company Case  
## Bose: Better Products through Research

In a recent survey by brand strategy firm Lippincott, the most trusted brand in consumer electronics was not Apple. Nor was it Samsung, Sony, or Microsoft. It was Bose, the still relatively small, privately held corporation that has been making innovative audio devices for more than 50 years. Despite putting more than 30 million new sets of headphones alone on or in customers’ ears last year, Bose rang up only about $4 billion in revenues versus Apple’s $234 billion. But when it comes to the passion customers feel for their brands, the Massachusetts-based technology company outshines even Apple. Bose forges that deep consumer connection based on the brand’s design simplicity and brilliant functionality.  
Bose adheres religiously to a set of values that have guided the company since its origins. Most companies today focus heavily on building revenues, profits, and stock prices. They try to outdo competitors by differentiating product lines with features and attributes that other companies don’t have. Although Bose doesn’t ignore such factors, its competitive advantage is rooted in its unique corporate philosophy. “We are not in it strictly to make money,” says CEO Bob Maresca. Given the company’s focus on research and product innovation, he points out that “the business is almost a secondary consideration.”

### The Bose Philosophy

To understand Bose the company, you must first look at Bose the man. In the 1950s, founder Amar Bose was working on his third degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had a keen interest in research and studied various areas of electrical engineering. He also had a strong interest in music. When he purchased his first hi-fi system—a model that he believed had the best specifications—he was disappointed in the system’s ability to reproduce realistic sound. So he began heavily researching the problem to find his own solution. Thus began a stream of research that would ultimately lead to the founding of the Bose Corporation in 1964. It also led to the development of the long-standing Bose slogan “Better Sound Through Research.”  
From those early days, Amar Bose worked around certain core principles that have guided the philosophy of the company. In conducting his first research on speakers and sound, he did something that has since been repeated time and time again at Bose. He ignored existing technologies and started entirely from scratch, something not common in product development strategies.  
In another departure from typical corporate strategies, Amar Bose put all of the privately held company’s profits back into research and development, a practice that reflected his avid love of research and his drive to produce the highest-quality products.
