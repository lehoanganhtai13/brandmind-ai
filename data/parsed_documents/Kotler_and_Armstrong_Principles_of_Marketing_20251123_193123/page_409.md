# 13.2 Omni-Channel Retailing: Creating a Seamless Shopping Experience

The shopping process has changed radically in recent years. Not all that long ago, shopping consisted mostly of going store to store—or perhaps flipping through catalogs—to gather product information, make price comparisons, and purchase goods. That was then. Now—in this age of the internet, computers, smartphones, and other digital devices—shopping typically involves a dazzling array of channels and platforms.

Today’s omni-channel consumers readily research products and prices online, shopping digitally from home, from work, in stores, or anywhere in between. They scour retailer websites and social media for buying ideas, inspiration, and advice. They might see products in stores and order them online, see products online then buy them in stores, or even buy goods online for in-store pickup. This massive shift in how people shop calls for massive changes in how store retailers operate. Omni-channel *buying* calls for omni-channel *retailing*, integrating all available shopping channels and devices into a seamless customer shopping experience.

At first, as online and mobile shopping caught fire, store retailers worried about *showrooming*—smartphone-wielding customers researching products online while examining them in stores, then jumping ship to catch lower online prices. But most store retailers have now adjusted to the showrooming threat with price-matching and other in-store tactics. In fact, smart retailers now see phone-toting customers not as a threat but as an opportunity.

For example, Best Buy has found that omni-channel shoppers have a higher-than-average propensity to purchase. One study showed that shoppers who use mobile devices in stores are almost twice as likely to purchase from the same retailer in-store or online than to buy elsewhere. “We love being used as the internet’s showroom,” says Best Buy’s CEO. Where Best Buy once fought showrooming, the chain now facilitates the process, converting showroomers into buyers. Best Buy sales associates are trained to proactively cross-check prices against both their own and other retailer’s online offers, including online retailers like Amazon. Employees can then price-match competitors, putting the price question to rest and letting associates focus on areas where Best Buy has the advantage—such as personal advice and service, immediacy, convenient locations, and easy returns. Best Buy’s new tagline highlights this strategy: “Best Buy: Expert Service. Unbeatable Prices.”

Retailers have learned that shoppers with smartphones are doing far more than just checking online prices. More often, they are filling in the information gap. “The consumer has never been more informed, and that information comes from their phone,” says a senior marketer at outdoor-gear retailer REI. “We love when someone enters the store holding their phone saying, ‘I want this tent. I want this bike. Help me find this.’” This type of activity shows how digital and store retailing can come together to make a sale, even without cutting price.

But omni-channel retailing goes way beyond just helping in-store customers as they cross-shop on digital devices. It requires carefully integrating the entire range of available shopping channels, both in-store and out, from discovery to purchase in the buying process. For example, most large retailers are now boosting their own online and digital selling options and linking them with stores. One popular way to do that is by letting customers order online and pick up in the store. The “click-and-collect” experience merges the attractions of digital and in-store shopping. For example, Walmart has upped its emphasis on in-store pickups. It tells customers that they can order from its Walmart.com site, often pick up items on the same day, avoid shipping fees, and easily return items to the store if not satisfied. Customers now pick up half of all Walmart.com purchases in stores, often buying additional merchandise during the visit.

Some customers even use mobile to place online orders with a given retailer while visiting that retailer’s store. Ten percent of Walmart purchases via mobile devices are made from inside a Walmart store. GAP Inc.—which operates the GAP, Old Navy, and Banana Republic chains—actively promotes in-store online ordering. Sales associates with tablets help customers search company-wide store and online inventories to find out-of-stock items. “It gives the team in the store the full capability to . . . meet your needs without you having to go home and do it yourself,” says a Banana Republic marketer.

In addition to websites, omni-channel retailers are integrating other digital shopping channels. Walmart, Target, Macy’s, and other major retailers offer handy mobile apps that pull customers to both their websites and stores, let them prepare shopping lists, help them locate merchandise inside stores, and, in Target’s case, send daily alerts and exclusive offers.
