## Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process

Marketing management can adopt one of five competing market orientations. The *production concept* holds that management’s task is to improve production efficiency and bring down prices. The *product concept* holds that consumers favor products that offer the most in quality, performance, and innovative features; thus, little promotional effort is required. The *selling concept* holds that consumers will not buy enough of an organization’s products unless it undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion effort. The *marketing concept* holds that achieving organizational goals depends on determining the needs and wants of target markets and delivering the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors do. The *societal marketing concept* holds that generating customer satisfaction and long-run societal well-being through sustainable marketing strategies is key to both achieving the company’s goals and fulfilling its responsibilities.

### OBJECTIVE 1-4  
**Discuss customer relationship management and identify strategies for creating value for customers and capturing value from customers in return.** *(pp 38–46)*

Broadly defined, *customer relationship management* is the process of engaging customers and building and maintaining profitable customer relationships by delivering superior customer value and satisfaction. *Customer-engagement marketing* aims to make a brand a meaningful part of consumers’ conversations and lives through direct and continuous customer involvement in shaping brand conversations, experiences, and community. The aim of customer relationship management and customer engagement is to produce high *customer equity*, the total combined customer lifetime values of all of the company’s customers. The key to building lasting relationships is the creation of superior *customer value* and *satisfaction*. In return for creating value for targeted customers, the company captures value *from* customers in the form of profits and customer equity.

### OBJECTIVE 1-5  
**Describe the major trends and forces that are changing the marketing landscape in this age of relationships.** *(pp 46–55)*

Dramatic changes are occurring in the marketing arena. The digital age has created exciting new ways to learn about and relate to individual customers. As a result, advances in digital and social media have taken the marketing world by storm. Online, mobile, and social media marketing offer exciting new opportunities to target customers more selectively and engage them more deeply. The key is to blend the new digital approaches with traditional marketing to create a smoothly integrated marketing strategy and mix.

The Great Recession caused consumers to rethink their buying priorities and bring their consumption back in line with their incomes. Even as the post-recession economy has strengthened, Americans are now showing an enthusiasm for frugality not seen in decades. The challenge is to balance a brand’s value proposition with current times while also enhancing its long-term equity.

In recent years, marketing has become a major part of the strategies for many not-for-profit organizations, such as colleges, hospitals, museums, zoos, symphony orchestras, foundations, and even churches. Also, in an increasingly smaller world, many marketers are now connected *globally* with their customers, marketing partners, and competitors. Finally, today’s marketers are also reexamining their ethical and societal responsibilities. Marketers are being called on to take greater responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of their actions.

Pulling it all together, as discussed throughout the chapter, the major new developments in marketing can be summed up in a single concept: *engaging customers and creating and capturing customer value*. Today, marketers of all kinds are taking advantage of new opportunities for building value-laden relationships with their customers, their marketing partners, and the world around them.
