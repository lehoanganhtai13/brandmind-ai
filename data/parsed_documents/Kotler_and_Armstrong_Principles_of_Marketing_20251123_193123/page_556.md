# Table 18.1 Strategies for Market Leaders, Challengers, Followers, and Nichers

This table outlines four distinct market strategies: Market Leader, Market Challenger, Market Follower, and Market Nicher. Market Leaders focus on expanding the total market, protecting their existing market share, and increasing their overall market share. Market Challengers employ more aggressive tactics, including full frontal attacks and indirect attacks, to gain ground. Market Followers adopt a more cautious approach, either following closely or at a distance, without initiating direct competition. Market Nichers concentrate on specific segments, differentiating their offerings by customer type, market segment, quality, price, or service, and may pursue multiple niching strategies. The structure is comparative, presenting distinct strategic approaches for firms operating in different market positions.

Market leaders can expand the market by developing new users, new uses, and more usage of its products. They usually can find *new users* or untapped market segments in many places. For example, traditionally boy-focused LEGOs—the world’s biggest toymaker—now successfully targets girls. Based on extensive research into differences between how boys and girls play, in 2011 the company introduced the LEGO Friends line for girls. The line features pastel color bricks and construction sets that encourage girls to build everything from Olivia’s House or Emma’s Pet Salon to Andrea’s City Park Café. LEGO Friends has become one of the most successful lines in LEGO history, helping to triple LEGO’s sales to girls within only one year. Last year alone, sales of the Friends line were up 30 percent over the previous year.¹⁵

Marketers can expand markets by discovering and promoting *new uses* for the product. For example, The WD-40 Company’s knack for expanding the market by finding new uses has made this popular substance one of the truly essential survival items in most American homes:¹⁶

> Some years ago, the company launched a search to uncover 2,000 unique uses for WD-40. After receiving 300,000 individual submissions, it narrowed the list to the best 2,000, which are now posted on the company’s website. Some consumers suggested simple and practical uses, such as keeping wicker chairs from squeaking, freeing stuck LEGO bricks, or cleaning crayon marks from just about anywhere. DID YOU KNOW THAT WD-40? Makes squirrels slide off bird feeder poles And, it seems, lots of people use WD-40 to make squirrels slide off birdfeeder poles. Others, however, reported some pretty unusual applications. One man uses WD-40 to polish his glass eye; another uses it to remove a prosthetic leg. A bus driver in Asia used WD-40 to remove a python that had coiled itself around the undercarriage of his vehicle. And did you hear about the nude burglary suspect who had wedged himself in a vent at a café in Denver? The fire department extracted him with a large dose of WD-40. Or how about the Mississippi naval officer who used WD-40 to repel an angry bear? Then there’s the college student who wrote to say that a friend’s nightly amorous activities in the next room were causing everyone in his dorm to lose sleep—he solved the problem by treating the squeaky bedsprings with WD-40. As the company concludes: “You often hear it said, ‘You only need two things in life: duct tape and WD-40. If it moves and shouldn’t, use duct tape. If it doesn’t move and should, use WD-40.’ Surely there’s a reason for that.”

Finally, market leaders can encourage *more usage* by convincing people to use the product more often or use more per occasion. For example, Campbell’s urges people to eat soup and other Campbell’s products more often by running ads containing new recipes. At the Campbell’s Kitchen website (www.campbellskitchen.com), visitors can search for or exchange recipes, create their own personal recipe box, learn ways to eat healthier, and sign up for a daily or weekly Meal Mail program. At the Campbell’s Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter sites, consumers can join in and share on Campbell’s Kitchen Community conversations.
