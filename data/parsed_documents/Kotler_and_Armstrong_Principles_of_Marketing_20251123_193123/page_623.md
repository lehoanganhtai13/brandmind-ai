# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### Teens and Social Media

Facebook recently announced that it will let teens’ posts become public. Before the change, Facebook would only allow 13- to 17-year-old users’ posts to be seen by their “friends” and “friends of friends.” Now, however, their posts can be seen by anyone on the network if they choose to make their posts “public.” Twitter, another social medium gaining popularity with teens, has always let users, including teens, share tweets publicly. But because of Facebook’s vast reach, privacy advocates are very concerned about this latest development, particularly when it comes to children’s safety. Online predators and bullying are real safety issues facing youth. Other criticisms of Facebook’s decision boil down to money—some argue that this is just about monetizing kids. Facebook will be able to offer a younger demographic to advertisers wanting to reach them. Facebook defends its actions, saying the change in policy is due to teenagers wanting the ability to post publicly, primarily for fundraising and promoting extracurricular activities such as sports and other school student organizations. Facebook has added precautions, such as a pop-up warning before teens can post publicly and setting “seen only by friends” as the default that must be changed if the teen desires posts to be public.

**20-9** Is Facebook acting responsibly or merely trying to monetize kids as critics claim? (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning)

**20-10** Come up with creative ways marketers can reach this demographic on Facebook without alienating their parents. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

## Marketing Ethics  
### Milking the International Market

Since the 1970s, Nestlé and other companies have faced criticism about their marketing of infant formula to families in underdeveloped countries. Their marketing has positioned formula as superior to breast milk and as a more modern way of feeding babies despite emerging research findings that breast milk usually led to healthier outcomes for babies. Third-world women grew dependent on infant formula to feed their babies but began watering it down to make it last longer and save money, often with contaminated water. This too often resulted in child malnourishment and other serious health problems and even death in some cases.

Nestlé has been accused by some child watchdog groups of using overly aggressive marketing tactics to sell its infant formula products. Nestlé targeted many new mothers with tactics such as providing samples, promoting products directly in hospitals and communities, and giving gifts to health-care workers and new moms. Other infant formula companies even hired salesgirls in nurses’ uniforms to drop by homes unannounced and sell potential customers on using baby formula rather than breastfeeding.

In April 2012, Nestlé acquired Pfizer’s infant nutrition unit, making it the biggest player in the infant formula market. According to *The Guardian*, this business unit generates approximately 85 percent of its revenues from emerging markets, demonstrating that Nestlé and other infant formula companies are still capitalizing on consumers in emerging economies. An International Nestlé Boycott Committee was started in 1984 to address this global issue and is still active today.

**20-11** In a small group, conduct research on this topic and formulate a sustainable, responsible marketing plan for marketing infant formula across the globe. Present your plan. (AACSB: Communication, Use of IT, Ethical Reasoning)

**20-12** Is it wrong for marketers to create wants where none exist in the marketplace in order to make profits? Support your answer. (AACSB: Communication, Ethical Reasoning)

## Marketing by the Numbers  
### The Cost of Sustainability

Kroger, the country’s leading grocery-only chain, added a line of private-label organic and natural foods called Simple Truth to its stores. If you’ve priced organic foods, you know they are more expensive. For example, a dozen conventionally farmed grade-A eggs at Kroger costs consumers $1.70, whereas Simple Truth eggs are priced at $3.50 per dozen. One study found that, overall, the average price of organic foods is 85 percent more than conventional foods. However, if prices get too high, consumers Honest Tea, the Coca-Cola brand that produced $130 million in global revenues last year, got its start because cofounder Seth Goldman didn’t like the options in the beverage coolers at convenience stores.
