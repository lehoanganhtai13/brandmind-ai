# 3 Analyzing the Marketing Environment

> So far, you’ve learned about the basic concepts of marketing and the steps in the marketing process for engaging and building profitable relationships with targeted consumers. Next, we’ll begin digging deeper into the first step of the marketing process—understanding the marketplace and customer needs and wants. In this chapter, you’ll see that marketing operates in a complex and changing environment. Other actors in this environment—suppliers, intermediaries, customers, competitors, publics, and others—may work with or against the company. Major environmental forces—demographic, economic, natural, technological, political, and cultural—shape marketing opportunities, pose threats, and affect the company’s ability to engage customers and build customer relationships. To develop effective marketing strategies, a company must first understand the environment in which marketing operates.

> To start, let’s look at Philips, one of the world’s biggest electronics companies and one of the most recognized and respected brands. Their lighting products have been found in homes all around the world. However, the markets Philips Lighting is operating in are subject to constant change. The storied company discovered that a continuous and sophisticated assessment of the factors that influence and shape the marketing environment is paramount.

## PHILIPS: Analyzing the Marketing Environment in the Middle East

Koninklijke Philips N.V. was founded by Anton and Gerard Philips in 1891 in Eindhoven to manufacture carbon filament lamps. Among their first major clients were early electricity companies, who included the provision of lamps in their power supply contracts. The company, now better known as Philips, is one of the world’s biggest electronics companies and one of the world’s most respected brands. It has evolved into a global player and today employs a workforce of 113,687 around the world. A market leader in medical diagnostic imaging, patient monitoring systems, energy-efficient lighting, and lifestyle solutions for personal well-being, Philips manufactures more than 50,000 products across 100 countries, in which it also operates sales and service outlets. In 2014, the firm reported sales of $23,982 billion. But Philips has also stayed true to its roots—today, it is the world leader in lighting products manufacturing.

On September 23, 2014, Philips announced that it would separate its healthcare and lighting businesses into two new companies in order to better tailor its offerings to the specific customer segments and leverage the Philips brand. Giving independence to the lighting solutions business, Philips claims, will better enable it to expand its global leadership position and venture into adjacent market opportunities. Both companies are supposed to be able to make the appropriate investments to boost growth and drive profitability, ultimately generating significantly more value for their customers, employees, and shareholders.

> Philips Lighting is no. 1 in the world market for lighting, but as the marketing environment constantly changes, Philips has realized that assessing multiple factors for change is vital to the understanding of current and future shifts.

Since the 1980s, Philips has participated intensively in the concentration of the lighting sector by purchasing smaller national companies such as Companie des Lampes (France), AEG (Germany), and Polam Pila (Poland). It has also developed different joint ventures; for example, with Westinghouse Lamps, Kono Sylvania, and EBT China. Today, Philips Lighting is no. 1 in the world market for lighting, ahead of competitors like Osram, Halonix, and Crompton. Their lighting products (light bulbs and lamps) are found all around the world, not only everywhere at home, but also in many professional applications, including 30 percent of offices, 65 percent of the world’s top airports, 30 percent of hospitals, 35 percent of cars, and 55 percent of major football stadiums.
