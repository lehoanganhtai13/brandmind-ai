## Critical Thinking Exercises

- 15-6 Search YouTube for three of your favorite television commercials, each using a different execution style. For each ad, identify the execution style used and the audience targeted. Is it a good ad? Be prepared to present the commercials and support your conclusions. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)  
- 15-7 Advertising objectives can be classified by their primary purpose—to *inform*, *persuade*, or *remind*. In a small group, locate one advertisement that primarily informs, one that persuades, and one that reminds. Explain how each ad meets the desired objective. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)  
- 15-8 In early 2016, the Wounded Warrior Project suffered a major blow to its fundraising when reports surfaced suggesting that the nonprofit organization spent too much of its money on travel, conferences, and high-end events rather than direct assistance to wounded veterans. Research this case. Was the Wounded Warrior Project’s public relations response to the alleged misspending accusations effective in reaching out to its donors and other audiences? Why or why not? How is social media changing the public relations process? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)  

# APPLICATIONS AND CASES

## Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
### Facebook Audience Network

Facebook has 1.44 billion monthly users and a large proportion of users typically visits the site daily on a mobile device. What started as an online social network that let people connect with each other has transformed into a behemoth media platform that promises to be a game-changer in mobile advertising. Facebook announced its new mobile ad platform called Audience Network to deliver targeted mobile ads for advertisers. While there are other mobile ad platforms (Google is the dominant player), Facebook has a treasure trove of data that is useful for advertisers. Google is strong in search data, but Facebook is part of our lives. Facebook has been placing ads on its site for advertisers, but now Facebook will be pushing those ads to third-party apps. This is a win-win-win situation for advertisers, app developers, and Facebook because advertisers get their mobile ads to people based on very personal information, app developers get ad revenue, and Facebook gets a cut of the ad revenue for placing the ad. And it’s no small cut—in just the last quarter of 2015, Facebook earned $5.6 billion in mobile ad revenue. That’s 80 percent of Facebook’s overall ad revenue.

- 15-9 Compare and contrast Facebook’s, Google’s, and Twitter’s ad networks. Which is most effective for advertisers? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)  
- 15-10 Mobile advertising is one of the fastest-growing sectors of digital advertising, but how is mobile advertising effectiveness measured? Research this issue and create a report of your findings. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

### Lie To Me

The UK public relations industry is worth an estimated $12 billion per year. Some $9 billion is spent in-house by business organizations, and the remaining $3 billion is spent on hiring freelance public relations specialists. A review of the public relations industry in the United Kingdom revealed a fascinating mix of operations and options. For the most part, the larger PR agencies are concentrated in London. These tended to be big-budget-oriented, extremely professional, large agencies with a host of blue chip clients.
