# Advertising and Public Relations

Using a highly targeted digital campaign, it sold out 100 25th-anniversary models of its iconic Mazda MX-5 Miata car in only 10 minutes. Special thanks to those at Mazda North America Operations. Here’s to 26 years of the MX-5 Miata and beyond. Long live the roadster.

Churning out Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ posts directly to its large MX-5 Miata fan base, directing them to a microsite where they could preorder the sporty little car. Engaging the right audience in the right media worked well for Mazda. The microsite opened a month later to a flood of responses, and the limited-edition Miata model sold out within only 10 minutes.

Although Nielsen is beginning to measure *media engagement* levels for some television, radio, and social media, such measures are still hard to find in most cases. Current media measures are things such as ratings, readership, listenership, and click-through rates. However, engagement happens inside the head of the consumer. It’s hard enough to measure how many people are exposed to a given television ad, video, or social media post, let alone measure the depth of engagement with that content. Still, marketers need to know how customers connect with an ad and brand idea as a part of the broader brand relationship.

Engaged consumers are more likely to act upon brand messages and even share them with others. Thus, rather than simply tracking *consumer impressions* for a media placement—how many people see, hear, or read an ad—Coca-Cola now also tracks the *consumer expressions* that result, such as a comment, a “Like,” uploading a photo or video, or sharing brand content on social networks. Today’s empowered consumers often generate more messages about a brand than a company can.

For example, Coca-Cola estimates that of the hundreds of millions of views of Coca-Cola–related content on YouTube each year, only about 18 percent are of content created by Coca-Cola. The other 82 percent are of content created by engaged consumers. So, many Coca-Cola marketing campaigns are aimed at sparking brand-related consumer expressions rather than just impressions. For instance, the brand’s recent “Share a Coke” summer campaign—in which it swapped out the company’s iconic logo on 20-ounce Coke bottles for one of more than 1,000 of the nation’s most popular names—encouraged Coca-Cola fans to share the bottles with friends and family. Consumers could also share their Coca-Cola photos, stories, and experiences online using the hashtag #ShareaCoke, with selected posts featured on the brand’s website and across company billboards. The “Share a Coke” campaign resulted in more than 500,000 photos and 6 million virtual Coke bottles shared online along with a boost of almost 25 million Coca-Cola Facebook followers.

## Choosing among Major Media Types

As summarized in **Table 15.2**, the major media types are television; digital, mobile, and social media; newspapers; direct mail; magazines; radio; and outdoor. Each medium has its advantages and its limitations. Media planners want to choose a mix of media that will effectively and efficiently present the advertising message to target customers. Thus, they must consider each medium’s impact, message effectiveness, and cost.

As discussed earlier in the chapter, traditional mass media still make up a majority of today’s media mixes. However, as mass-media costs rise and audiences shrink, companies have now added digital, mobile, and social media that cost less, target more effectively, and engage consumers more fully. Today’s marketers are assembling a full mix of *paid, owned, earned, and shared media* that create and deliver engaging brand content to target consumers.

In addition to the explosion of online, mobile, and social media, cable and satellite television systems are thriving. Such systems allow narrow programming formats, such as all sports, all news, nutrition, arts, home improvement and gardening, cooking, travel, history, finance, and others that target select groups. Comcast and other cable operators are even testing systems that will let them target specific types of ads to TVs in specific neighborhoods or individually to specific types of customers. For example, ads for a Spanish-language channel would run in only Hispanic neighborhoods, or only pet owners would see ads from pet food companies.
