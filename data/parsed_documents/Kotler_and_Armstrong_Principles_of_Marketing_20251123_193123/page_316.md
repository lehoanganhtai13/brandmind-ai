# Cost-Plus Pricing

Construction companies, for example, submit job bids by estimating the total project cost and adding a standard markup for profit. Lawyers, accountants, and other professionals typically price by adding a standard markup to their costs. Some sellers tell their customers they will charge cost plus a specified markup; for example, aerospace companies often price this way to the government.

To illustrate markup pricing, suppose a toaster manufacturer had the following costs and expected sales:

This data presents a cost structure analysis, likely for a business or product. It identifies three key financial variables: a **variable cost** of $10 per unit, **fixed costs** totaling $300,000, and **expected unit sales** projected at 50,000 units. The structure is comparative, detailing the distinct cost components and their expected volume. This information is foundational for calculating break-even points, profitability, and overall financial performance based on sales volume. The relationship between these variables is direct: variable costs scale with production/sales, fixed costs remain constant regardless of volume, and expected sales provide the volume context for evaluating the impact of these costs.

Then the manufacturer’s cost per toaster is given by the following:

$$
\text{unit cost} = \text{variable cost} + \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{unit sales}} = 10 + \frac{300,000}{50,000} = 16
$$

Now suppose the manufacturer wants to earn a 20 percent markup on sales. The manufacturer’s markup price is given by the following:  

$$
\text{markup price} = \frac{\text{unit cost}}{1 - \text{desired return on sales}} = \frac{16}{1 - 0.2} = 20
$$

The manufacturer would charge dealers $20 per toaster and make a profit of $4 per unit. The dealers, in turn, will mark up the toaster. If dealers want to earn 50 percent on the sales price, they will mark up the toaster to $40 ($20 + 50% of $40). This number is equivalent to a *markup on cost* of 100 percent ($20/$20).

Does using standard markups to set prices make sense? Generally, no. Any pricing method that ignores demand and competitor prices is not likely to lead to the best price. Still, markup pricing remains popular for many reasons. First, sellers are more certain about costs than about demand. By tying the price to cost, sellers simplify pricing; they do not need to make frequent adjustments as demand changes. Second, when all firms in the industry use this pricing method, prices tend to be similar, so price competition is minimized. Third, many people feel that cost-plus pricing is fairer to both buyers and sellers. Sellers earn a fair return on their investment but do not take advantage of buyers when buyers’ demand becomes great.

# Break-Even Analysis and Target Profit Pricing

Another cost-oriented pricing approach is **break-even pricing** (or a variation called **target return pricing**). The firm sets a price at which it will break even or make the target return on the costs of making and marketing a product.

Target return pricing uses the concept of a *break-even chart*, which shows the total cost and total revenue expected at different sales volume levels.  

This data illustrates a cost-volume-profit analysis framework, presenting a comparative structure of financial elements. It begins with **Fixed costs**, established at $300,000 and independent of sales volume. These are then combined with **Variable costs**, which are directly proportional to sales volume, to determine **Total costs**. The analysis also includes a **Total revenue curve**, which originates at zero and increases with each unit sold, with its slope dictated by a price of $20 per unit. The core relationship depicted is how these cost and revenue components interact to influence profitability based on sales volume.

**Figure 10.5** shows a break-even chart for the toaster manufacturer discussed here.
