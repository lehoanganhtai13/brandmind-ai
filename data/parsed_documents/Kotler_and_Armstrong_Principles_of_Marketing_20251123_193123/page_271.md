# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Co-branding can also have limitations. Such relationships usually involve complex legal contracts and licenses. Co-branding partners must carefully coordinate their advertising, sales promotion, and other marketing efforts. Finally, when co-branding, each partner must trust that the other will take good care of its brand. If something damages the reputation of one brand, it can tarnish the co-brand as well.

## Brand Development

A company has four choices when it comes to developing brands (see **Figure 8.6**). It can introduce *line extensions*, *brand extensions*, *multibrands*, or *new brands*.

----

**Line extension**  
Extending an existing brand name to new forms, colors, sizes, ingredients, or flavors of an existing product category.

**Line Extensions.** Line extensions occur when a company extends existing brand names to new forms, colors, sizes, ingredients, or flavors of an existing product category. For example, over the years, KFC has extended its “finger lickin’ good” chicken lineup well beyond original recipe, bone-in Kentucky fried chicken. It now offers grilled chicken, boneless fried chicken, chicken tenders, hot wings, chicken bites, chicken popcorn nuggets, a Doublicious chicken-bacon-cheese sandwich, and KFC Go Cups—chicken and potato wedges in a handy car-cup holder that lets customers snack on the go.

A company might introduce line extensions as a low-cost, low-risk way to introduce new products. Or it might want to meet consumer desires for variety, use excess capacity, or simply command more shelf space from resellers. However, line extensions involve some risks. An overextended brand name might cause consumer confusion or lose some of its specific meaning.

For example, in its efforts to offer something for everyone—from basic burger buffs to practical parents to health-minded fast-food seekers—McDonald’s has created a menu bulging with options. Some customers find the crowded menu a bit overwhelming, and offering so many choices has complicated the chain’s food assembly process and slowed service at counters and drive-thrus. In response, McDonald’s has recently begun efforts to cut items and simplify its menu, especially at its drive-thrus, which account for 70 percent of sales.  

At some point, additional extensions might add little value to a line. For instance, the original Doritos Tortilla Chips have morphed into a U.S. roster of more than 20 different types of chips and flavors, plus dozens more in foreign markets. Flavors include everything from Nacho Cheese and Pizza Supreme to Blazin’ Buffalo & Ranch, Fiery Fusion, and Salsa Verde. Or how about duck-flavored Gold Peking Duck Chips or wasabi-flavored Mr. Dragon’s Fire Chips (Japan)? Although the line seems to be doing well with U.S. sales of more than $1.3 billion, the original Doritos chips now seem like just another flavor. And how much would adding yet another flavor steal from Doritos’ own sales versus those of competitors? A line extension works best when it takes sales away from competing brands, not when it “cannibalizes” the company’s other items.

**Brand extension**  
Extending an existing brand name to new product categories.

**Brand Extensions.** A **brand extension** extends a current brand name to new or modified products in a new category. For example, Nest—the maker of stylish, connected, learning thermostats that can be controlled remotely from a phone—extended its line with an equally smart and stylish Nest Protect home smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. ● It’s now extending the Nest line to include “Works with Nest,” applications developed with a variety of partners that let its smart devices interact with and control everything from home video monitoring devices, smart door locks, and home lighting systems to home appliances and fitness tracking bands. All of the extensions fit together under Nest’s smart homes mission.

These days, a large majority of new products are extensions of already-successful brands. Compared with building new brands, extensions can create immediate new-product

### Figure 8.6  
**Brand Development Strategies**

This framework analyzes brand development opportunities by categorizing strategies based on whether the product category is existing or new, and whether the brand itself is existing or new. When a company uses an existing brand for an existing product category, it's a line extension. Introducing an existing brand into a new product category constitutes a brand extension. If a company uses a new brand for an existing product category, it's a multibrands strategy. Finally, launching a new brand in a new product category is categorized as a new brands strategy. This structure provides a clear matrix for understanding different approaches to brand expansion and market entry. Brand extensions: Nest is now extending its brand to include “Works with Nest,” applications developed with a variety of partners that let its smart devices interact with and control everything from video monitoring devices, smart door locks, and home lighting systems to home appliances and fitness tracking bands.
