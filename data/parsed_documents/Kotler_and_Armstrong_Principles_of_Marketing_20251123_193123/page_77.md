# 2.2 DuckDuckGo: Google’s Tiniest, Fiercest Competitor

online search with its massive 64 percent market share. Two other giants—Microsoft’s Bing and Yahoo!—combine for another 34 percent of the market. That leaves a precious 2 percent sliver of the market for dozens of other search engines trying to get a foothold. What’s more, Google and the other search giants have deep pockets from their non-search businesses, letting them spend abundantly to hold and grow market share. So how does a small search engine wannabe compete against global powerhouses? The best answer: It doesn’t—at least not directly. Instead, it finds a unique market niche and runs where the big dogs don’t.

Enter DuckDuckGo, a plucky search engine start-up that’s carving out its own special market niche. Instead of battling Google and other giants head-on, DuckDuckGo provides a customer benefit that the market leaders can’t—privacy. Then it energizes its unique niche with brand personality and user community. One look at DuckDuckGo’s icon—a quirky bow-tied duck—gives you the sense that, like the small locomotive in the classic children’s story, this might be “the little engine that could.”

DuckDuckGo isn’t just surviving in its niche, it’s exploding. The company is still comparatively tiny—it averages about 3 billion searches a year compared with Google’s more than 1.2 trillion. But DuckDuckGo’s daily search volume has surged nearly tenfold in just the past three years, whereas Google’s volume growth has lagged a bit.

When Gabriel Weinberg first launched DuckDuckGo eight years ago, most people questioned his sanity. How could a small upstart challenge the likes of mighty Google? But rather than simply mimicking Google, Weinberg went a different direction, developing a quality search engine with a key differentiating feature. DuckDuckGo now positions itself strongly on “Smarter Search. Less Clutter. Real Privacy.”

DuckDuckGo focuses only on search. It offers a streamlined, clutter-free, customizable user interface with far fewer sponsored ads. As with other search engines, a DuckDuckGo query returns link-by-link search results based on third-party sources, but the results are filtered and reorganized to reduce spam. And beyond the usual search-result links, for many searches, DuckDuckGo provides direct “Instant Answers” in the form of zero-click information boxes above the search results. “When you do a search, you generally want an answer,” says Weinberg. “It’s our job to try to get an answer.” With Instant Answers, DuckDuckGo can “help you get where you want to go in fewer clicks.”

The Instant Answer feature is a good one, so good in fact that it has now been copied by Google and Bing. For example, run a Google search for “davinci” or “how long is the great wall” and along with the familiar list of blue links you’ll get a white box containing a mini-biography of Leonardo Da Vinci or displaying the length of the Great Wall of China (5,500.3 miles) and other interesting facts about it.

DuckDuckGo would tell you that its Instant Answers are often better. Its answers rely not just on third-party data sources but also on the deep and diverse knowledge of its active, growing, and loyal community of users and developers. DuckDuckGo’s community provides additional power behind its searches. In a Wikipedia-like fashion, DuckDuckGo users come up with ideas about what the answers should be, suggest sources, and even develop answers themselves. “DuckDuckGo is a search engine driven by community—you’re on the team!” says the company. “We’re not just servers and an algorithm. We’re so much more.”

Still, even though DuckDuckGo had Instant Answers long before Google, Google’s response illustrates a typical nicher dilemma. Market leaders usually have huge resources and can quickly copy the start-up’s most popular features. “At any point,” notes one analyst, “the Googles or Facebooks or Apples of the world can just mimic what made you different, slam-dunking your shattered dreams into the waste bin of tech history.”

Fortunately for DuckDuckGo, it has one crucial differentiator that the Googles of the world simply can’t mimic. Real privacy. Google’s entire model is built around personalization for customers and behaviorally targeted marketing for advertisers. That requires collecting and sharing data about users and their searches. When you search on Google, the company knows and retains in detail who you are, what you’ve searched for, and when you’ve searched. It then integrates your online identity and data with its services.
