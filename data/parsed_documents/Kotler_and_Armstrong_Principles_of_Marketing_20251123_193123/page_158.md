# Chapter 5 | Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

By listening and communicating constantly with their customers and taking into consideration their input when it comes to product development and improvement, Lenovo has been successful in building emotional relationships with their customers. They engage more directly with customers when they display traits such as honesty in admitting mistakes, as in case of the ThinkPad redesign. In this respect, Tracey Trachta, vice president of Brand Experience at Lenovo, states that the company aims to not just display its products on shelves, but through engagement to also enable people to understand what it is that makes Lenovo’s products different. Through the years, Lenovo’s emphasis on building emotional relationships with their customers has given them a more personal cast than a mere computer manufacturer.

In addition to listening to their customers, Lenovo also filters and focuses their analytic efforts on better understanding the online behavior of site visitors. Concentrating on two of their main user segments, purchasers and non-purchasers, Lenovo constantly aims to better understand their online buying behavior on the homepage and product pages specifically. Learning the differences between them enables Lenovo to develop and deliver the right message to the right users, ultimately converting non-purchasing users into purchasers. In order to achieve this objective, Lenovo permanently visualizes the in-page behavior of each customer segment via so-called heat maps, which provide deep insights into users’ digital psychology.

In a recent study, Lenovo identified an interesting difference between purchasers and non-purchasers. One finding was that purchasers were drawn to the main homepage banner and deals, whereas non-purchasers avoided the banner and were less focused on their search, favoring product images and videos over text. As non-purchasers dominate a significant percentage of the Lenovo website user base, better understanding their customer experience was crucial towards improving it and increasing conversion rates. Drawing from the study, the company has used greater ratios of images and videos to text in order to guide those potential customers and engage with them to a greater extent.

Understanding what’s most important to the customer is paramount for Lenovo because the company continuously focuses on exceeding customer expectations and creating customer delight. For example, when the company noticed that many of the discussions about PCs, tablets, and other electronic devices were happening on blogs and third-party discussion forums, they spent a lot of time trying to understand the existing conversations and participating in discussions. Lenovo then decided that it wanted more ownership, even better customer understanding, and stronger leadership in the discussions about its products. Accordingly, Lenovo set up its own discussion forums and actively asked customers to share their ideas, user experience, and tips with Lenovo’s product, design, and development teams. By doing so, Lenovo was able to better connect with its customers and provide even better customer service.

In all, Lenovo possesses a unique ability to achieve customer satisfaction and engagement. The company has positively shaped and influenced customers’ perceptions of Lenovo’s brand personality by trying to listen to and understand them. Consumers today—conditioned by mobile and powered by the Internet—need brands that can interact with them in real time. Lenovo engages in a consistent, respectful, two-way dialogue with their target audience. As a result, various satisfaction studies consistently place the company well ahead of its competitors in various satisfaction studies. Technology Business Research (TBR), for example, has declared Lenovo the best computer brand in its extensive Corporate IT Buying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction studies. Giving top marks in important categories of customer satisfaction and innovation, the analysis found Lenovo’s customer service and cutting-edge features second to none.
