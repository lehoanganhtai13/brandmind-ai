## Marketing by the Numbers NAICS

It replaces the old product-based Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system introduced in the 1930s. The NAICS system classifies businesses by production processes, better reflecting changes in the global economy, especially in the service and technology industries. It was developed jointly by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 1997 in concert with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), providing a common classification system for the three countries and better compatibility with the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) system. This six-digit number (in some cases, seven or ten digits) is very useful for understanding business markets.

**6-13** What do the six digits of the NAICS code represent? What industry is represented by the NAICS code 721110? How many businesses comprise this code? (AACSB: Communication)

**6-14** How can marketers use NAICS codes to better deliver customer satisfaction and value? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

## Video Case Eaton

With approximately 70,000 employees in more than 150 countries and annual revenues of nearly $12 billion, Eaton is one of the world’s largest suppliers of diversified industrial goods. Eaton has been known for products that make cars peppier and 18-wheelers safer to drive. But a recent restructuring has made Eaton a powerhouse in the growing field of power management. In short, Eaton is making electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical power systems more accessible to and more efficient for its global customers. But Eaton isn’t successful only because of the products and services that it sells. It is successful because it works closely with its business customers to help them solve their problems and create better products and services of their own. Eaton is known for high-quality, dependable customer service and product support. In this manner, Eaton builds strong relationships with its clients.

After viewing the video featuring Eaton, answer the following questions:

**6-15** What is Eaton’s value proposition?

**6-16** Who are Eaton’s customers? Describe Eaton’s customer relationships.

**6-17** Discuss the different ways that Eaton provides value beyond that which customers can provide for themselves.

## Company Case Procter & Gamble: Treating Business Customers as Strategic Partners

For decades, Procter & Gamble has been at the top of almost every expert’s A list of outstanding marketing companies. The experts point to P&G’s stable of top-selling consumer brands or to the fact that year in and year out P&G is the world’s largest advertiser. Consumers seem to agree. You’ll find at least one of P&G’s blockbuster brands in 99 percent of all American households; in many homes, you’ll find a dozen or more familiar P&G products. But P&G is also highly respected for something else—maintaining strategic partnerships with business buyers.

P&G recognizes that building enduring relationships between consumers and its category leading brands starts with building enduring relationships with its large retail clients. On the front lines of this effort is P&G’s iconic sales force. When it comes to selecting, training, and managing salespeople, P&G sets the gold standard. The company employs a massive sales force of more than 5,000 salespeople worldwide. But at P&G, it isn’t just “sales”—it’s “Customer Business Development” (CBD). This might seem trivial, but at P&G the distinction goes to the very core of the company’s customer relationship strategy.

**6-11** What are the likely reasons for the tie-up between Innocent and McDonald’s?

Would not impact any of the brand’s ethical commitment, and that smoothies were a better alternative than Coke for kids and consumers. However, after a five-year-trial failed to attract customers, Innocent was dropped from McDonald’s menu in 2012. In 2013, to further the company’s commercial interest, Innocent was sold to Coca-Cola in a deal that valued the brand at £320 million.
