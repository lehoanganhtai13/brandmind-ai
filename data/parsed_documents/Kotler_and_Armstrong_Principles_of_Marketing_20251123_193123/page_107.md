More and more, companies are making environmental sustainability a part of their core missions. For example, in accordance with the company’s purpose to make sustainable living commonplace, Knorr has committed itself to sustainable agriculture. Under the motto “Good Taste Is Our Nature,” the brand has positioned itself as a supplier of high-quality products that taste good and are made of natural ingredients (see Real Marketing 3.1).

> Technological advances are perhaps the most dramatic forces affecting today’s marketing strategies. Just think about the tremendous impact on marketing of digital technologies—which have exploded in years. You’ll see examples of the fast-growing world of online, mobile, and social media marketing throughout every chapter, and we’ll discuss them in detail in Chapter 17.

Forces that create new technologies, creating new product and market opportunities.

# The Technological Environment

The **technological environment** is perhaps the most dramatic force now shaping our destiny. Technology has released such wonders as antibiotics, robotic surgery, smartphones, and the internet. It also has released such horrors as nuclear missiles and assault rifles. It has released such mixed blessings as the automobile, television, and credit cards. Our attitude toward technology depends on whether we are more impressed with its wonders or its blunders.

New technologies can offer exciting opportunities for marketers. For example, what would you think about having tiny little transmitters implanted in all the products you buy that would allow tracking of the products from their point of production through use and disposal? How about a bracelet with a chip inserted that would let you make and pay for purchases, receive personalized specials at retail locations, or even track your whereabouts or those of friends? Or how about “beacon” technology that would do all those things using your smartphone? On the one hand, such technologies would provide many advantages to both buyers and sellers. On the other hand, they could be a bit scary. Either way, with the advent of such technologies as radio-frequency identification (RFID), GPS, and Bluetooth, it’s already happening.

Many firms are already using RFID technology to track products and customers at various points in the distribution channel. For example, Walmart has strongly encouraged suppliers shipping products to its distribution centers to apply RFID tags to their pallets. And retailers such as American Apparel, Macy’s, and Bloomingdales are now installing item-level RFID systems in their stores. Fashion and accessories maker Burberry even uses chips imbedded in items and linked to smartphones to provide personalized, interactive experiences for customers in its stores and at runway shows.  

🔵 Disney is taking RFID technology to new levels with its cool MagicBand RFID wristband:

> Wearing a MagicBand at The Walt Disney World Resort opens up a whole new level of Disney’s famed magic. After registering for cloud-based MyMagic+ services, with the flick of your wrist you can enter a park or attraction, buy dinner or souvenirs, or even unlock your hotel room. But Disney has only begun to tap the MagicBand’s potential for personalizing guest experiences. Future applications could be truly magical. Imagine, for example, the wonder of a child who receives a warm hug from Mickey Mouse or a bow from Prince Charming, who then greets the child by name and wishes her a happy birthday. Imagine animatronics that interact with nearby guests based on personal information supplied in advance. You get separated from family or friends? No problem. A quick scan of your MagicBand at a nearby directory could pinpoint the locations of your entire party. Linked to your Disney phone app, the MagicBand could trigger in-depth information about park features, ride wait times, FastPass check-in alerts, and your reservations schedule. Of course, the MagicBand also offers Disney a potential mother lode of digital data on guest activities and movements in minute detail, helping to improve guest logistics, services, and sales. If all this seems too Big Brother-ish, there will be privacy options—for example, letting parents opt out of things like characters knowing children’s names. In all, such digital technologies promise to enrich the Disney experience for both guests and the company.
