Walmart, Lenovo, and Spirit Airlines are leading practitioners of this strategy.  
* *Differentiation.* Here the company concentrates on creating a highly differentiated product line and marketing program so that it comes across as the class leader in the industry. Most customers would prefer to own this brand if its price is not too high. Nike and Caterpillar follow this strategy in apparel and heavy construction equipment, respectively.  
* *Focus.* Here the company focuses its effort on serving a few market segments well rather than going after the whole market. For example, Ritz-Carlton focuses on the top 5 percent of corporate and leisure travelers. Bose concentrates on very high-quality electronics products that produce better sound. Hohner owns a stunning 85 percent of the harmonica market.

Companies that pursue a clear strategy—one of the above—will likely perform well. The firm that carries out that strategy best will make the most profits. But firms that do not pursue a clear strategy—*middle-of-the-roaders*—do the worst. Sears, Levi-Strauss, and Holiday Inn encountered difficult times because they did not stand out as the lowest in cost, highest in perceived value, or best in serving some market segment. Middle-of-the-roaders try to be good on all strategic counts but end up being not very good at anything.

Two marketing consultants, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, offer a more customer-centered classification of competitive marketing strategies. They suggest that companies gain leadership positions by delivering superior value to their customers. Companies can pursue any of three strategies—called *value disciplines*—for delivering superior customer value:

* *Operational excellence.* The company provides superior value by leading its industry in price and convenience. It works to reduce costs and create a lean and efficient value delivery system. It serves customers who want reliable, good-quality products or services but want them cheaply and easily. Examples include Walmart, IKEA, Zara, and Southwest Airlines.  
* *Customer intimacy.* The company provides superior value by precisely segmenting its markets and tailoring its products or services to exactly match the needs of targeted customers. It specializes in satisfying unique customer needs through a close relationship with and intimate knowledge of the customer. It empowers its people to respond quickly to customer needs. Customer-intimate companies serve customers who are willing to pay  
  > a premium to get precisely what they want. They will do almost anything to build long-term customer loyalty and to capture customer lifetime value. For example, Emirates has clearly followed the strategy of differentiation and has emerged as one of the biggest airlines in the world (see Real Marketing 18.2). Other companies that practice customer intimacy include Lexus, Zappos, L.L. Bean, and Ritz-Carlton hotels.  
* *Product leadership.* The company provides superior value by offering a continuous stream of leading-edge products or services. It aims to make its own and competing products obsolete. Product leaders are open to new ideas, relentlessly pursue new solutions, and work to get new products to market quickly. They serve customers who want state-of-the-art products and services regardless of the costs in terms of price or inconvenience. One example of a product leader is Tesla Motors:

> A Tesla automobile—any model—doesn’t come cheap, and you’ll have to wait a while to get one. But it’s the ultimate in cutting-edge electric vehicles. The Tesla Model S goes from 0 to 60 in under 3 seconds when driven in “Ludicrous Mode” and offers a host of innovative features, such as retractable door handles, a 17-inch touchscreen, a sound system that rivals a recording studio, and a host of safety features. Best of all: It needs no oil changes and has no gas tank to fill. 🔵 The Tesla Model X crossover SUV even features futuristic falcon-wing doors.

Tesla’s product leadership has sparked the imaginations of people who want to stay ahead of the curve in auto ownership. For example, within only days of unveiling the more affordable yet still incredibly stylish $35,000 Tesla Model 3, Tesla was swamped with 400,000 reservation deposits of $1,000, even though the cars wouldn’t be delivered for a year or more. Auto research site Edwards sums it up this way:  
> “Tesla has found success not because they built an electric vehicle, but because they built a sports car that happens to have an innovative electric powertrain. It is a vehicle that customers love.”
