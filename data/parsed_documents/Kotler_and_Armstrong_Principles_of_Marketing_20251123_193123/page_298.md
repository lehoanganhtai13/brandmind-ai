# Table 9.2 Summary of Product Life-Cycle Characteristics, Objectives, and Strategies

This table outlines the characteristics, marketing objectives, and strategies associated with the four stages of a product life cycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The cycle progresses from low sales and negative profits with innovators as customers in the Introduction phase, to rapidly rising sales and increasing profits with early adopters in the Growth phase. The Maturity stage sees peak sales, high profits, and mainstream adopters, with a stable but potentially declining competitor base. Finally, the Decline phase is marked by declining sales and profits, with lagging adopters and a decreasing number of competitors. Marketing objectives shift from creating awareness and trial to maximizing market share and profit, and then to reducing expenditure. Strategies for product, price, distribution, advertising, and sales promotion are adapted at each stage to align with these evolving market conditions and objectives.

# Additional Product and Service Considerations

We wrap up our discussion of products and services with two additional considerations: social responsibility in product decisions and issues of international product and services marketing.

## Product Decisions and Social Responsibility

Marketers should carefully consider public policy issues and regulations regarding acquiring or dropping products, patent protection, product quality and safety, and product warranties.

Regarding new products, the government may prevent companies from adding products through acquisitions if the effect threatens to lessen competition. Companies dropping products must be aware that they have legal obligations, written or implied, to their suppliers, dealers, and customers who have a stake in the dropped product. Companies must also obey U.S. patent laws when developing new products. A company cannot make its product illegally similar to another company’s established product.
