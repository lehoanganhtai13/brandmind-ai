# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines key objectives related to product and service marketing, structured hierarchically. Objective 8-1 focuses on defining a product and categorizing major product and service classifications. Building upon this foundation, Objective 8-2 delves into the strategic decisions companies make concerning individual products, product lines, and their overall product mixes. Objective 8-3 then shifts focus to the unique aspects of marketing services, identifying four core characteristics that influence their promotion and highlighting additional marketing considerations specific to services. Finally, Objective 8-4 addresses branding strategy, detailing the decisions involved in building and managing strong brands. The objectives progress from fundamental definitions to strategic decision-making in product and service management and marketing.

**AS THE GOPRO STORY** shows, in their quest to create customer relationships, marketers must build and manage products and brands that connect with customers. This chapter begins with a deceptively simple question: *What is a product?* After addressing this question, we look at ways to classify products in consumer and business markets. Then we discuss the important decisions that marketers make regarding individual products, product lines, and product mixes. Next, we examine the characteristics and marketing requirements of a special form of product—services. Finally, we look into the critically important issue of how marketers build and manage product and service brands.

> As you’ll see, this deceptively simple question has a very complex answer. For example, think back to the opening GoPro story. What is the GoPro “product”?

### What Is a Product?

We define a **product** as anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use, or consumption that might satisfy a want or need. Products include more than just tangible objects, such as cars, clothing, or mobile phones. Broadly defined, products also include services, events, persons, places, organizations, and ideas or a mixture of these. Throughout this text, we use the term *product* broadly to include any or all of these entities. Thus, an Apple iPhone, a Toyota Camry, and a Caffé Mocha at Starbucks are products. But so are a trip to Las Vegas, Schwab online investment services, your Instagram account, and advice from your family doctor.

Because of their importance in the world economy, we give special attention to **services**. Services are a form of product that consists of activities, benefits, or satisfactions offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in the ownership of anything. Examples include banking, hotel, airline travel, retail, wireless communication, and home-repair services. We will look at services more closely later in this chapter.

### Products, Services, and Experiences

Products are a key element in the overall *market offering*. Marketing mix planning begins with building an offering that brings value to target customers. This offering becomes the basis on which the company builds profitable customer relationships.

A company’s market offering often includes both tangible goods and services. At one extreme, the market offer may consist of a *pure tangible good*, such as soap, toothpaste, or salt; no services accompany the product. At the other extreme are *pure services*, for which the market offer consists primarily of a service. Examples include a doctor’s exam and financial services.
