Factors. The process of dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers who have different needs, characteristics, or behaviors and who might require separate marketing strategies or mixes is called **market segmentation**.

Every market has segments, but not all ways of segmenting a market are equally useful. For example, Tylenol would gain little by distinguishing between low-income and high-income pain-relief users if both respond the same way to marketing efforts. A **market segment** consists of consumers who respond in a similar way to a given set of marketing efforts. In the car market, for example, consumers who want the biggest, most comfortable car regardless of price make up one market segment. Consumers who care mainly about price and operating economy make up another segment. It would be difficult to make one car model that was the first choice of consumers in both segments. Companies are wise to focus their efforts on meeting the distinct needs of individual market segments.

## Market Targeting
After a company has defined its market segments, it can enter one or many of these segments. **Market targeting** involves evaluating each market segment’s attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter. A company should target segments in which it can profitably generate the greatest customer value and sustain it over time.

A company with limited resources might decide to serve only one or a few special segments or market niches. Such nichers specialize in serving customer segments that major competitors overlook or ignore. For example, McLaren sold only 1,653 of its very-high-performance cars last year but at very high prices—such as its 570S model at $180,000 or a made-to-order FI model starting at an eye-popping $980,000. Most nichers aren’t quite so exotic. Profitable low-cost airline Allegiant Air avoids direct competition with larger major airline rivals by targeting smaller, neglected markets and new fliers. Nicher Allegiant “goes where they ain’t.” And small online-search start-up DuckDuckGo thrives among privacy-minded users in the shadows of search giants Google and Microsoft’s Bing (see Real Marketing 2.2).

- The L’Oréal group serves major segments of the beauty market, and within each segment it caters to many sub segments. L’Oréal targets the larger segments through its major divisions: L’Oreal Luxe, Consumer Products, Professional Products, Active Cosmetics, and the Body Shop. Further within these major divisions, L’Oréal markets various brands that cater to customers of different ages, incomes, and lifestyles. For example, its Consumer Product division sells brands like Garnier, L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline New York, African Beauty Brand, Essie, and NYX Professional Make Up. Similarly, the L’Oreal Luxe division offers more than 15 brands, including Lancôme, Giorgio Armani, Urban Decay, Diesel, and Ralph Lauren.

Most companies enter a new market by serving a single segment; if this proves successful, they add more segments. For example, Nike started with innovative running shoes for serious runners. Large companies eventually seek full market coverage. Nike now makes and sells a broad range of sports apparel and equipment for just about anyone and everyone in about every sport. It designs different products to meet the special needs of each segment it serves.

## Market Differentiation and Positioning
After a company has decided which market segments to enter, it must determine how to differentiate its market offering for each targeted segment and what positions it wants to occupy in those segments. A product’s *position* is the place it occupies relative to competitors’ products in consumers’ minds. Marketers want to develop unique market positions for their products. If a product is perceived to be exactly like others on the market, consumers would have no reason to buy it.

**Positioning** is arranging for a product to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place relative to competing products in the minds of target consumers. Marketers plan positions that distinguish their products from competing brands and give them the greatest advantage in their target markets.

BMW promises “Sheer driving pleasure”; Subaru is “Confidence in motion.” Coca-Cola wants you to “Taste the feeling”; Pepsi says “Live for now.” Del Monte is “Bursting with Life”; Cascadian Farm products are “Certified Organic. Guaranteed Delicious.” At Panera, you’ll find “Food as it should be”; at Wendy’s, “Quality Is Our Recipe.”
