“native to” the web or social media site in which it is placed. That is, the brand content looks in form and function like the other natural content surrounding it on a web or social media platform. It might be an article on a website such as *The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Mashable,* or even *The New York Times* or *The Wall Street Journal* that is paid for, written by, and placed by an advertiser but uses the same format as articles written by the editorial staff. Or it might be brand-prepared videos, pictures, posts, or pages integrated into social media such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, or Twitter that match the form and feel of native content on those media. Examples include Twitter’s promoted tweets, Facebook’s promoted stories, *BuzzFeed*’s sponsored posts, or Snapchat’s “brand story” ads, branded posts that appear in the app’s “Stories” feed. Native advertising is an increasingly popular form of brand content. It lets advertisers create relevant associations between brand and consumer content. According to a recent study by the Association of National Advertisers, “given today’s media landscape, where consumers can avoid ads more than ever, advertisers are looking for new ways to get their messages noticed and acted upon.”[^15]

Thus, Madison & Vine is now the meeting place for advertising, brand content, and entertainment. The goal is to make brand messages a part of the broader flow of consumer content and conversation rather than an intrusion or interruption of it. As advertising agency JWT puts it, “We believe advertising needs to stop *interrupting* what people are interested in and *be* what people are interested in.” However, advertisers must be careful that the new intersection itself doesn’t become too congested. With all the new brand content formats and integration, Madison & Vine threatens to create even more of the very clutter that it was designed to break through. At that point, consumers might decide to take yet a different route.

## Message and Content Strategy

The first step in creating effective advertising content is to plan a *message strategy*—the general message that will be communicated to consumers. The purpose of advertising is to get consumers to engage with or react to the product or company in a certain way. People will engage and react only if they believe they will benefit from doing so. Thus, developing an effective message strategy begins with identifying customer *benefits* that can be used as advertising appeals. Ideally, the message strategy will follow directly from the company’s broader positioning and customer value–creation strategies.

Message strategy statements tend to be plain, straightforward outlines of benefits and positioning points that the advertiser wants to stress. The advertiser must next develop a compelling **creative concept**—or big idea—that will bring the message strategy to life in a distinctive and memorable way. At this stage, simple message ideas become great ad campaigns. Usually, a copywriter and an art director will team up to generate many creative concepts, hoping that one of these concepts will turn out to be the big idea. The creative concept may emerge as a visualization, a phrase, or a combination of the two.

The creative concept will guide the choice of specific appeals to be used in an advertising campaign. *Advertising appeals* should have three characteristics. First, they should be *meaningful*, pointing out benefits that make the product more desirable or interesting to consumers. Second, appeals must be *believable*. Consumers must believe that the product or service will deliver the promised benefits.

However, the most meaningful and believable benefits may not be the best ones to feature. Appeals should also be *distinctive*. They should tell how the product is better than competing brands. For example, the most meaningful benefit of a refrigerator is that it keeps foods cold. But GE sets its Café refrigerator apart as one that gives users an in-the-door filtered hot water dispenser and a Keurig® K-Cup® single-serve brewing system for making cups of coffee, tea, and other hot beverages at the fridge. It’s “a new way to brew.” Similarly, the most meaningful benefit of owning a wristwatch is that it keeps accurate time, yet few watch ads feature this benefit. Instead, watch advertisers might select any of a number of advertising themes. For years, Timex has been the affordable watch that “takes a licking and keeps on ticking.” In contrast, Rolex ads talk about the brand’s “obsession with perfection” and the fact that “Rolex has been the preeminent symbol of performance and prestige for more than a century.”

---- The advertiser now must turn the big idea into an actual ad execution that will capture the target market’s attention and interest.
