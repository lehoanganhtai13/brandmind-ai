# Pricing Strategies: Additional Considerations

Most important, segmented prices should reflect real differences in customers’ perceived value. Consumers in higher price tiers must feel that they’re getting their extra money’s worth for the higher prices paid. Otherwise, segmented pricing practices can cause consumer resentment. For example, buyers reacted negatively when a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs investigation found that women often pay more for female versions of products that are virtually identical to male versions except for gender-specific packaging:[^8]

The DCA compared the prices of male and female versions for nearly 800 products—including children’s toys and clothing, adult apparel, personal care products, and home goods. It found that items marketed to girls and women cost an average of 7 percent more than similar items aimed at boys and men. In the hair care category, women paid 48 percent more for products such shampoo, conditioner, and gel; razor cartridges cost women 11 percent more. For example, a major drug store chain sold a blue box of Schick Hydro 5 razor cartridges for $14.99; virtually identical cartridges for the Schick Hydro “Silk,” a purple-boxed sister brand, sold for $18.49. In another case, Target sold red Radio Flyer scooters for boys at $24.99; the same scooter in pink for girls was priced at $49.99. Target lowered its price for the pink scooter after the DCA report was released, calling the price mismatch a “system error.” Although no laws prohibit gender-based pricing differences, such glaring disparities can damage a brand’s credibility and reputation.

Companies must also be careful not to treat customers in lower price tiers as second-class citizens. Otherwise, in the long run, the practice will lead to customer resentment and ill will. For example, in recent years, the airlines have incurred the wrath of frustrated customers at both ends of the airplane. Passengers paying full fare for business- or first-class seats often feel that they are being gouged. At the same time, passengers in lower-priced coach seats feel that they’re being ignored or treated poorly.

## Psychological Pricing

Price says something about the product. For example, many consumers use price to judge quality. A $100 bottle of perfume may contain only $3 worth of scent, but some people are willing to pay the $100 because this price indicates something special.

In using **psychological pricing**, sellers consider the psychology of prices, not simply the economics. For example, consumers usually perceive higher-priced products as having higher quality. When they can judge the quality of a product by examining it or by calling on past experience with it, they use price less to judge quality. But when they cannot judge quality because they lack the information or skill, price becomes an important quality signal. For instance, who’s the better lawyer, one who charges $50 per hour or one who charges $500 per hour? You’d have to do a lot of digging into the respective lawyers’ credentials to answer this question objectively; even then, you might not be able to judge accurately. Most of us would simply assume that the higher-priced lawyer is better.

Another aspect of psychological pricing is **reference prices**—prices that buyers carry in their minds and refer to when looking at a given product. The reference price might be formed by noting current prices, remembering past prices, or assessing the buying situation. Sellers can influence or use these consumers’ reference prices when setting price. For example, a grocery retailer might place its store brand of bran flakes and raisins cereal priced at $2.49 next to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran priced at $3.79. Or a company might offer more expensive models that don’t sell very well to make its less expensive but still-high-priced models look more affordable by comparison. For example, Williams-Sonoma once offered a fancy bread maker at the steep price of $279. However, it then added a $429 model. The expensive model flopped, but sales of the cheaper model doubled.[^9]

For most purchases, consumers don’t have all the skill or information they need to figure out whether they are paying a good price. They don’t have the time, ability, or inclination to research different brands or stores, compare prices, and get the best deals. Instead, they may rely on certain cues that signal whether a price is high or low. Interestingly, such pricing cues are often provided by sellers, in the form of sales signs, price-matching guarantees, loss-leader pricing, and other helpful hints.

### Definitions

This table outlines two key concepts related to pricing strategy: Psychological pricing and Reference prices. Psychological pricing focuses on leveraging the psychological impact of prices, using them to convey specific messages about a product beyond its economic value. This approach is closely linked to Reference prices, which are the internal benchmarks or expectations consumers hold for a product's price. When evaluating a product, buyers compare its listed price against these mental reference points, influencing their perception of value and their purchasing decisions. Essentially, psychological pricing aims to manipulate or align with these reference prices to achieve desired market outcomes.
