# Marketing Intermediaries

They include resellers, physical distribution firms, marketing services agencies, and financial intermediaries.

*Resellers* are distribution channel firms that help the company find customers or make sales to them. These include wholesalers and retailers that buy and resell merchandise. *Physical distribution firms* help the company stock and move goods from their points of origin to their destinations. *Marketing services agencies* are the marketing research firms, advertising agencies, media firms, and marketing consulting firms that help the company target and promote its products to the right markets. *Financial intermediaries* include banks, credit companies, insurance companies, and other businesses that help finance transactions or insure against the risks associated with the buying and selling of goods.

Like suppliers, marketing intermediaries form an important component of the company’s overall value delivery network. Thus, today’s marketers recognize the importance of working with their intermediaries as partners rather than simply as channels through which they sell their products. Although Apple has hundreds of its own retail locations throughout the world, it also uses the services of authorized resellers who help the firm sell its products all over the world. In this arrangement, Apple’s products are sold at identical prices both in its stores and in those of authorized resellers. Apple considers these authorized resellers as partners and has recently overhauled its premium resellers’ partners program. The organization is co-funding the renovation of resellers’ stores to follow Apple’s own retail formula and make demo units display consistent with Apple’s specifications. Apart from those who sell its products, Apple also has another set of intermediaries called authorized service providers. These are companies or individuals who represent organizations in providing repair and maintenance services to its customers. These intermediaries could belong to either of two categories, depending on the scale of the services that could be handled: authorized service providers or limited service providers. Apple gives its partners reimbursements for labor, travel, and parts, where applicable. It also gives them comprehensive access to products, upgrade information, service, troubleshooting, on-the-spot technical support for certified technicians, etc. In addition, the partners benefit from inclusion in the Apple resource locator system, whereby they are displayed on Apple’s website for customers looking for nearby service providers.

### Competitors

The marketing concept states that, to be successful, a company must provide greater customer value and satisfaction than its competitors do. Thus, marketers must do more than simply adapt to the needs of target consumers. They also must gain strategic advantage by positioning their offerings strongly against competitors’ offerings in the minds of consumers.

No single competitive marketing strategy is best for all companies. Each firm should consider its own size and industry position compared with those of its competitors. Large firms with dominant positions in an industry can use certain strategies that smaller firms cannot afford. But being large is not enough. There are winning strategies for large firms, but there are also losing ones. And small firms can develop strategies that give them better rates of return than large firms enjoy.
