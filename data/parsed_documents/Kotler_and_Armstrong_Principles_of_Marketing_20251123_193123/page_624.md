# Video Case Honest Tea

So with the help of a former professor, he launched Honest Tea — the nation’s first fully organic bottled tea.

But the company’s drive for success was not based not as much on profits as on a desire to change the world. With social responsibility steeped deep into its business model, Honest Tea set out to help develop the economic structure of impoverished nations. Honest Tea purchased raw ingredients from Native American and South African farmers and invested in its supplier-farmers to help them become self-reliant. Although Honest Tea has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company since 2011, it continues to operate on the principles of social responsibility established by its founders.

After viewing the video featuring Honest Tea, answer the following questions:

- **20-15** List as many examples as you can showing how Honest Tea defies the common social criticisms of marketing.
- **20-16** How does Honest Tea practice sustainable marketing?
- **20-17** With all its efforts to do good, can Honest Tea continue to do well? Explain.

# Company Case adidas: Athletic Apparel with Purpose

As CEO of the adidas Group for the past 15 years, Herbert Hainer has made quite a mark. Although the global athletic footwear and apparel giant has established itself as a leader in just about every sport, Hainer’s legacy might stand in an area that has little to do with basketball, baseball, or even soccer. Under Hainer’s influence, adidas has emerged as one of the global leaders in sustainable practices. Last year, the Germany-based sports giant ranked fifth among the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations.

## A Marathon, Not a Sprint

Some companies have sustainability built in to their DNA. Companies such as Patagonia, Ben & Jerry’s, and Method were founded by folks who were more driven to create socially responsible products, companies, and business practices than to make money. But companies such as Unilever, BMW, and adidas — all current sustainability leaders — discovered over time that they could succeed financially in their respective industries while at the same time being kind to the environment and providing better working conditions. In fact, these companies contend that a sound strategic plan built on sustainable practices makes them better financial performers than they might be otherwise.

adidas came to that realization nearly 20 years ago. In 1998, the company issued its first official environmental statement. In the years that followed, it tracked its performance against social and environmental goals and made its progress transparent in an annual report. But in 2008, the company revised its sustainability strategy, making it more comprehensive and ambitious than ever before.

These days just about every company makes claims about reducing its carbon footprint. But adidas’s sustainability path stands as a model to any company that truly wants to make a difference. In short, making a difference when it comes to the health and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants takes more than just lip service. For a company to make an impact, sustainability must be ingrained in its organizational culture.

At adidas, such a cultural commitment is apparent in the degree to which the company has woven sustainability into its core business. Using a sports analogy, adidas’s sustainability statement describes its efforts to become more sustainable and socially responsible as a marathon, not a sprint. 

> “It’s about preparedness and setting the right pace, having both the drive and the stamina to make it the distance. And most of all, it is about endurance: overcoming setbacks and difficulties, keeping the finishing line always in the forefront of our minds.”

Some time ago, adidas established a set of core values that have shaped its corporate culture: performance, passion, integrity, and diversity. If these were just words on the wall at corporate headquarters, they wouldn’t amount to much. But at adidas, these values 

> “commit us to playing by the rules that society expects of a responsible company.” 

Such values create the cultural infrastructure that drives 

> “designing products that are environmentally sound . . . reducing the environmental impacts of our day-to-day operations and in our supply chain . . . setting workplace standards for our suppliers to meet . . . looking after the well-being and careers of our employees . . . and making a positive contribution to the communities where we operate.”

# Additional Questions

- **20-13** Most large egg farmers sell eggs directly to retailers. Using Kroger’s prices, what is the farmer’s price per dozen to the retailer for conventional and organic eggs if Kroger’s margin is 20 percent based on its retail price? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)
- **20-14** How many dozen eggs does a conventional farmer need to sell to break even? How many does an organic farmer need to sell to break even? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

----

One element of sustainability is organic farming, which costs much more than conventional farming, and those higher costs are passed on to consumers. Suppose that a conventional egg farmer’s average fixed costs per year for conventionally farmed eggs are $1 million per year, but an organic egg farmer’s fixed costs are three times that amount. The organic farmer’s variable costs of $1.80 per dozen are twice as much as conventional farmer’s variable costs. Refer to Appendix 2, Marketing by the Numbers, to answer the above questions.
