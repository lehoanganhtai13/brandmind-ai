The past few years have brought hard times for shopping centers. Many experts suggest that the country has long been “overmalled.” Not surprisingly, the Great Recession and its aftermath hit shopping malls hard. Consumer spending cutbacks forced many retailers—small and large—out of business, and vacancy rates at the nation’s enclosed malls soared. Power centers were also hard hit as their big-box retailer tenants such as Circuit City, Borders, Mervyns, and Linens N Things went out of business and others such as Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, and Office Depot reduced the number or size of their stores. Some of the pizzazz has also gone out of lifestyle centers, whose upper-middle-class shoppers suffered most during the recession.

As the economy has improved, however, malls of all types have rebounded a bit. Many power centers, for example, are filling their empty space with a broader range of retailers, from the likes of Ross Dress for Less, Boot Barn, Nordstrom Rack, and other off-price retailers to dollar stores, warehouse grocers, and traditional discounters like Walmart and Target.

# Retailing Trends and Developments

Retailers operate in a harsh and fast-changing environment, which offers threats as well as opportunities. Consumer demographics, lifestyles, and spending patterns are changing rapidly, as are retailing technologies. To be successful, retailers need to choose target segments carefully and position themselves strongly. They need to take the following retailing developments into account as they plan and execute their competitive strategies.

## Tighter Consumer Spending

Following many years of good economic times for retailers, the Great Recession of 2008–2009 turned many retailers’ fortunes from boom to bust. Even as the economy has recovered, retailers will feel the effects of changed consumer spending patterns well into the future.

Some retailers actually benefit from a down economy. For example, as consumers cut back and looked for ways to spend less on what they bought, big discounters such as Costco scooped up new business from bargain-hungry shoppers. And price-oriented and off-price retailers such as ALDI, Dollar General, and TJ Maxx have attracted greater shares of more frugal buyers.

For other retailers, however, tighter consumer spending meant tough times. During and following the recession, several large and familiar retailers declared bankruptcy or closed their doors completely—including household names such as Linens N Things, Circuit City, KB Toys, Borders Books, and The Sharper Image, to name a few. Other retailers, from Macy’s and Home Depot to Starbucks, laid off employees, cut their costs, and offered deep price discounts and promotions aimed at luring cash-strapped customers back into their stores.

As the economy has improved and as consumers have retained their more frugal spending ways, many retailers have added new value pitches to their positioning. For example, Home Depot replaced its older “You can do it. We can help.” theme with a thriftier one: “More saving. More doing.” Retailers ranging from Walmart to Macy’s to Kroger and Whole Foods Market have boosted their emphasis on more economical private-label brands. And to compete with the boom in fast-casual restaurants such as Panera Bread and Chipotle, traditional sit-down restaurants have added value offerings of their own. For example, Applebee’s has a 2 for $20 menu—two meals and one appetizer, all for just $20.  

Value positioning: To attract today’s more value-oriented consumers, TGI Friday’s offers The 474 “Where less is more” menu, featuring right-sized appetizers at $4, main dishes at $7, and desserts at $4.

When reacting to economic difficulties, retailers must be careful that their short-run actions don’t damage their long-run images and positions. For example, drastic price discounting can increase immediate sales but damage brand loyalty. One analyst calls this “death by discount” and suggests that “virtually every retailer—at both the high and New retail forms continue to emerge to meet new situations and consumer needs, but the life cycle of new retail forms is getting shorter.
