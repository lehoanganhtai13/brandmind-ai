# Executing on the Promise

The company tossed out its original straightforward text logo in favor of something far more abstract—a symbol that resembles a puffy capital letter “A” with the two sides crossing over. Airbnb calls it the “bélo,” “the universal symbol of belonging.” The new logo communicates a sense of belonging through something that transcends language, culture, and geography. A new slogan accompanies the logo—“Belong Anywhere.”

To ensure that the Airbnb guest experience is as authentic and unique as possible, the company focuses first and foremost on its community of hosts. In fact, Airbnb considers its hosts to be its primary customers. As a result, Airbnb has been able to nurture a huge global community of lodging providers who are true believers in the Airbnb vision. Treated as active participants in the business, hosts develop a sense of ownership and devotion. In this manner, Airbnb influences hosts to follow certain guidelines toward creating the best guest experience possible. This is by no means intended to create a standardized model. But by urging hosts to offer guest services such as airport pickup and walking tours, Airbnb strengthens the connections formed with guests. “What’s special in your world isn’t just the home you have,” Chesky tells the crowd at the Airbnb Open. “It’s your whole life.”

The explosive expansion of Airbnb in every world market has certainly caught the attention of the big hotel chains. Developers are beginning to build hotels in places where they normally would not. For example, eight new hotels are going up in Williamsburg, a Brooklyn neighborhood that is a huge Airbnb market but not a traditional tourist locale. But even as hoteliers attempt to invade Airbnb’s turf, they will have a tough time duplicating the Airbnb experience.

Despite its expansion and success, Airbnb still finds itself battling for legitimacy. Some cities do not allow the rental of personal property for any duration less than 30 days. And there are many travelers who might prefer the Airbnb experience but still have concerns about staying with strangers. Airbnb is rising to these challenges with idealistic fervor. In fact, Chesky goes so far as to suggest that Airbnb’s mission goes beyond providing an authentic guest experience and into the realm of establishing world peace. He explains that living in close proximity to those from other cultures makes people understand each other a lot more. He concludes, “I think a lot of conflicts in the world are between groups that don’t understand each other.”
