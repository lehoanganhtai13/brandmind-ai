# Protecting Market Share

While trying to expand total market size, the leading firm also must protect its current business against competitors’ attacks. Walmart must constantly guard against Target and Costco; Caterpillar against Komatsu; Apple’s iPad and iPhone against Samsung; and McDonald’s against Wendy’s and Burger King.

What can the market leader do to protect its position? First, it must prevent or fix weaknesses that provide opportunities for competitors. It must always fulfill its value promise and work tirelessly to engage valued customers in strong relationships. Its prices must remain consistent with the value that customers see in the brand. The leader should “plug holes” so that competitors do not jump in.

But the best defense is a good offense, and the best response is *continuous innovation*. The market leader refuses to be content with the way things are and leads the industry in new products, customer services, distribution effectiveness, promotion, and cost cutting. It keeps increasing its competitive effectiveness and value to customers. And when attacked by challengers, the market leader reacts decisively. For example, in the $53 billion global disposable diaper market, market leader P&G—with its Pampers and Luvs brands—has been relentless in its offense against challengers such as Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies:[^17]

> P&G invests huge resources in disposable diaper and baby-care R&D, seeking to build the ultimate diaper that yields “zero leakage, ultimate dryness, ultimate comfort, with an underwear-like fit,” says a P&G baby-care research manager. ● At five baby-care centers around the globe, P&G’s researchers push the boundaries of science and style to keep a technological edge over challengers. P&G’s baby-care division now has more than 5,000 diaper patents granted or pending. For instance, in 2010 P&G introduced Dry Max Pampers, perhaps the biggest diaper  
> innovation in 25 years—20 percent thinner yet twice as absorbent as before. More recently, it introduced Pamper Premium Care Pants, diapers with all-around elastic that can be pulled on like underwear. Next up in diaper innovation: smart diapers with imbedded sensors that alert parents through smartphone apps when their babies wet a diaper or even notify parents if they detect the wearer catching a disease. Beyond its push for technological superiority, P&G employs its hefty marketing clout to engage consumers and persuade them that its diapers are best for their babies. In all, thanks to its relentless innovation and brand building, in the United States P&G holds a 42.9-percent-and-growing market share versus challenger Kimberly-Clark’s 37 percent. In the huge Chinese diaper market, it holds a 42 percent share to Kimberly Clark’s 11 percent.

# Expanding Market Share

Market leaders also can grow by increasing their market shares further. In many markets, small market share increases mean very large sales increases. For example, in the U.S. shampoo market, a 1 percent increase in market share is worth $70 million in annual sales; in carbonated soft drinks, almost $1 billion^18

Studies have shown that, on average, profitability rises with increasing market share. Because of these findings, many companies have sought expanded market shares to improve profitability. GE, for example, declared that it wants to be at least number one or two in each of its markets or else get out. GE shed its computer, air-conditioning, small appliances, and television businesses because it could not achieve top-dog position in those industries.

However, some studies have found that many industries contain one or a few highly profitable large firms, several profitable and more focused firms, and a large number of medium-sized firms with poorer profit performance. It appears that profitability increases as a business gains share relative to competitors in its *served market*. For example, Lexus holds only a small share of the total car market, but it earns a high profit because it is a leading brand in the luxury-performance car segment. And it has achieved this high Firms that are second, third, or lower in an industry are sometimes quite large, such as PepsiCo, Ford, Lowe’s, Hertz, Target, and AT&T.
