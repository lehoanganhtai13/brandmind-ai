# Deceptive Practices

Deceptive practices fall into three groups: promotion, packaging, and pricing. *Deceptive promotion* includes practices such as misrepresenting the product’s features or performance or luring customers to the store for a bargain that is out of stock. *Deceptive packaging* includes exaggerating package contents through subtle design, using misleading labeling, or describing size in misleading terms.

*Deceptive pricing* includes practices such as falsely advertising “factory” or “wholesale” prices or a large price reduction from a phony high retail “list price.” For example, retailers the likes of JCPenney and Kohl’s were hit with lawsuits last year alleging that they used inflated original prices. A class-action suit against Macy’s accused the retailer of duping customers with a “phantom markdown scheme” and of “purporting to offer steep discounts off of fabricated, arbitrary, and false former or purported original, regular or ‘compare at’ prices.”[^3] And Overstock.com was recently fined $6.8 million by a California court as a result of a fraudulent pricing lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of eight California counties. The suit charged that the online giant routinely advertised its prices as lower than fabricated “list prices.” It recites one example in which Overstock sold a patio set for $449 while claiming that the list price was $999. When the item was delivered, the customer found that it had a Walmart sticker stating a price of $247.[^4]

Deceptive practices have led to legislation and other consumer protection actions. For example, in 1938 Congress enacted the Wheeler-Lea Act, which gave the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) power to regulate “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” The FTC has since published several guidelines listing deceptive practices. Despite regulations, however, some critics argue that deceptive claims are still common, even for well-known brands. 

> For example, Luminosity recently agreed to pay $2 million to settle FTC charges that it deceived consumers with unsupported claims that its “brain training” games would protect them against cognitive decline. “Lumosity preyed on consumers’ fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer’s disease,” said the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “But Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads.”[^5]

The toughest problem often is defining what is “deceptive.” For instance, an advertiser’s claim that its chewing gum will “rock your world” isn’t intended to be taken literally. Instead, the advertiser might claim, it is “puffery”—innocent exaggeration for effect. However, others claim that puffery and alluring imagery can harm consumers in subtle ways. Think about the popular and long-running MasterCard Priceless commercials that once painted pictures of consumers fulfilling their priceless dreams despite the costs. The ads suggested that your credit card could make it happen. But critics charge that such imagery by credit card companies encouraged a spend-now-pay-later attitude that caused many consumers to *overuse* their cards.

Marketers argue that most companies avoid deceptive practices. Because such practices harm a company’s business in the long run, they simply aren’t sustainable. Profitable customer relationships are built on a foundation of value and trust. If consumers do not get what they expect, they will switch to more reliable products. In addition, consumers usually protect themselves from deception. Most consumers recognize a marketer’s selling intent and are careful when they buy, sometimes even to the point of not believing completely true product claims.
