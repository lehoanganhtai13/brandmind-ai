# Advertising and Public Relations

And for a time, the Mayhem campaign halted Allstate’s market share slide. According to Allstate CEO Thomas Wilson, “It’s working. If you look at our quotes and our new business, it’s way up.” All this prompted Allstate to extend the campaign, including the introduction of Mayhem’s Hispanic cousin, Mala Suerte (bad luck), aimed at Hispanic consumers. Mayhem has now been causing mayhem in the advertising industry for the past six years via more than 25 TV ads as well as numerous radio spots, billboard placements, and internet banner ads.

To extend the campaign, Allstate took Mayhem to the next level, giving the character his own Twitter account. Seemingly late to the Twitter party, Allstate executives indicated that the delay was intentional. “We’ve been very careful about not overdoing Mayhem and not overexposing [him],” said Jennifer Egeland, Allstate’s director of advertising. “[We wanted] the right idea for launching him in the Twitter space.”

The right idea was to conform to Mayhem’s persona. As a recent football season dawned, Mayhem polled followers about what he should portray in the next ad—a charcoal grill or a cheap bungee cord. Consumers voted for the cord. Mayhem disobeyed, tweeting: “Too bad I’m a tailgate grill. Who’s got a light?” He followed that up with Vine videos of a car set on fire from a grill mishap. Allstate then released two new Mayhem ads—“Tailgate Grill Fire” and “Cheap Bungee Cord”—making everyone happy. Also driving traffic to its social media sites was the “#MayhemSale” installment, a spot in which unsuspecting football fans Matt and Shannon had their house raided by a social media–savvy burglar. The spot drove significant web traffic and won a gold ADDY.

With all this activity and positive public response, Allstate seems to have found a weapon for maintaining its market position. But the all-out auto insurance advertising war illustrates just how critical it is to stay one step ahead of the competition. For the most recent year, Allstate increased its ad budget to $887 million, outdoing even market leader State Farm’s $802 million effort. However, both companies were eclipsed by GEICO’s eye-popping $1.1 billion advertising spending. Today, no less than 11 car insurance brands are running national TV advertising campaigns. Combined, the auto insurers now spend more than $6 billion each year to get their messages out. That makes things confusing for consumers, who struggle under the deluge of clever ads for the respective brands. It also creates mayhem for the insurers.

The intense competition, big budgets, and focus on consumer advertising have kept industry market share dynamic. In fact, during the past last year, GEICO moved into the number-two spot behind State Farm and is pulling away with a 10.8 percent share of the auto insurance market to Allstate’s 10.0 percent. Although Allstate has grown its auto insurance business in recent years, GEICO’s growth has been consistently stronger. With that development, Allstate is left to reconsider the value that it is getting out of its advertising investments and just how it might slow down GEICO and retake its number-two market position.
