# Table 4.2 | Types of Samples

This table outlines two primary categories of sampling methods: Probability Sample and Nonprobability Sample. Probability samples, which ensure every population member has a known and equal chance of selection, include simple random sampling, stratified random sampling (where the population is divided into mutually exclusive groups and samples are drawn from each), and cluster (area) sampling (where groups are selected, and then individuals within those groups are sampled). Nonprobability samples, conversely, do not offer known or equal chances of selection. These include convenience sampling (selecting the easiest members), judgment sampling (selecting members based on researcher's judgment of their suitability), and quota sampling (interviewing a predetermined number of individuals within specific categories). The structure is comparative, differentiating methods based on the randomness and known probability of selection.

# Research Instruments

In collecting primary data, marketing researchers have a choice of two main research instruments: *questionnaires* and *mechanical devices*.

**Questionnaires.** The questionnaire is by far the most common instrument, whether administered in person, by phone, by email, or online. Questionnaires are very flexible—there are many ways to ask questions. Closed-ended questions include all the possible answers, and subjects make choices among them. Examples include multiple-choice questions and scale questions. Open-ended questions allow respondents to answer in their own words. In a survey of airline users, Southwest Airlines might simply ask, “What is your opinion of Southwest Airlines?” Or it might ask people to complete a sentence: “When I choose an airline, the most important consideration is . . .” These and other kinds of open-ended questions often reveal more than closed-ended questions because they do not limit respondents’ answers.

Open-ended questions are especially useful in exploratory research, when the researcher is trying to find out *what* people think but is not measuring *how many* people think in a certain way. Closed-ended questions, on the other hand, provide answers that are easier to interpret and tabulate.

Researchers should also use care in the *wording* and *ordering* of questions. They should use simple, direct, and unbiased wording. Questions should be arranged in a logical order. The first question should create interest if possible, and difficult or personal questions should be asked last so that respondents do not become defensive.

**Mechanical Instruments.** Although questionnaires are the most common research instrument, researchers also use mechanical instruments to monitor consumer behavior. For example, Nielsen Media Research attaches people meters to television sets in selected homes to record who watches which programs. Retailers use checkout scanners to record shoppers’ purchases. Other marketers use mobile phone GPS technologies to track consumer movements in and near their stores.

Still other researchers apply *neuromarketing*, using EEG and MRI technologies to track brain electrical activity to learn how consumers feel and respond. Neuromarketing measures, often combined with *biometric* measures (such as heart rates, respiration rates, sweat levels, and facial and eye movements), can provide companies with insights into what turns consumers on and off regarding their brands and marketing. For example, research firm Nielsen and the Ad Council used neuromarketing to improve the effectiveness of an ad for the Shelter Pet Project, a public service campaign focused on increasing adoption rates for pets in shelters:  
Using neuroscience methods, Nielsen charted how people’s brains responded to an existing Shelter Pet Project public service ad and the ad’s canine star, Jules the dog. Researchers used a combination of EEG and eye-tracking measurements to determine the second-by-second, nielsen
