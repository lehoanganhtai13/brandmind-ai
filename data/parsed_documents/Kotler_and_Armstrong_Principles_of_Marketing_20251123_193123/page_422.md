But the rest of the Bass Pro Shops formula plays out in magnificent splendor across its many North American outlets. One mother sums up the Bass Pro Shops experience this way:

> We recently had a visiting family group that included two 5-year-olds. They thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Bass Pro Shops! It’s half retail store and half wildlife museum. There was plenty to see for any outdoor sports enthusiast. The kids loved seeing real fish and ducks, as well as plenty of inanimate displays. There were boats they could sit on and “trees” they could hide in. The store includes a restaurant. They offer plenty of merchandise for every budget, but you don’t really have to spend money to enjoy the visit. Highly recommended!

With its retail design that builds theater and entertainment into every store, Bass Pro Shops is not only a haven for the reluctant male outdoorsman, it’s enjoyable for everyone else. “First off, I am not an outdoor person so Bass Pro isn’t a shop for me,” says a recent store visitor. “That being said, I loved this store. I felt like I was in a museum and aquarium.”

Bass Pro Shops provides even more reasons to visit, with various special events such as Family Summer Camp, Professional Bull Riders Event, Fall Hunting Classic, and Halloween Bass Pro Style. Each event is filled with demonstrations and activities, including fishing and hunting seminars featuring national and local experts. But no other Bass Pro Shops event compares to Santa’s Wonderland, a six-week extravaganza that transforms each Bass Pro Shops outlet into a veritable Christmas village featuring rustic cabins, moving model trains, animated Christmas characters, interactive talking caribou, and live elves set among snow-covered hills and illuminated Christmas trees. Kids can hang out in the play zone and get their hands on old-time model trains, RC trucks, slot cars, and both laser and foam-dart guns. Families can spend time at various activity tables and make decorations and crafts to take home. They can also enjoy one of various seasonal goodies. And, of course, Santa’s Wonderland wouldn’t be complete without a visit from the jolly old elf himself, the event’s main feature that includes a free studio-quality photo.

As amazing as Bass Pro Shops’s retail design is, the company is not alone in its approach to marketing the great outdoors. Nebraska-based Cabela’s started its own operations just before Bass Pro Shops. Cabela’s has almost as many stores and pulls in nearly as much revenue. The Cabela’s retail experience is nearly identical to that of Bass Pro Shops, down to the aquariums, animal-filled dioramas, and shooting galleries.

However, the two chains have at least one major difference: Whereas Bass Pro Shops is thriving, Cabela’s long and successful run has been dogged in recent years by declining sales and losses. Falling victim to the intense competition from online vendors, Cabela’s was recently ranked by *Forbes* as the nation’s second-most troubled retail chain, trailing only the now-defunct Radio Shack. As Cabela’s has explored options to escape bankruptcy, the most prominent option at this point appears to be selling the company—to Bass Pro Shops. That’s right. The number-two outdoor retailer is currently entertaining an offer from number one. And if it goes through, Bass Pro Shops would not only double in size (the two chains rarely have stores in the same market), it would gain economy-of-scale advantages including cost savings and greater leverage with manufacturers.

But even if the acquisition of Cabela’s doesn’t pan out, Bass Pro Shops will keep doing what it has been doing for decades—wowing customers with the unsurpassed retail experience of its nature theme parks. “People spend time there when they go,” Morris says of Bass Pro Shops stores. “They can’t wait to see what’s around the next aisle. It’s an experience. It’s about creating memories. It’s about being with friends and family. It’s about having fun.”

### Questions for Discussion

This table presents a series of analytical questions related to Bass Pro Shops' business strategy and market position. The questions probe the company's targeting approach, specifically questioning whether it offers a truly differentiated customer experience. They also require an examination of how Bass Pro Shops achieved its leading position as an outdoor retailer by analyzing the retail marketing mix. Furthermore, the questions ask for a classification of Bass Pro Shops within major retail types and an explanation for its success relative to Cabela's. Finally, the table includes a question evaluating the strategic wisdom of Bass Pro Shops acquiring Cabela's. The overarching structure is comparative and analytical, focusing on understanding Bass Pro Shops' success factors and strategic decisions within the retail landscape.

### MyLab Marketing  
Go to **mymktlab.com** for the following Assisted-graded writing questions:

This table presents two distinct questions related to retail and marketing. The first question, 13-23, probes the concept of "retail convergence," asking for its definition and an assessment of its impact, specifically whether it has benefited or disadvantaged small retailers. The second question, 13-24, shifts focus to the physical aspects of retail, requesting a description of different types of shopping centers and the identification of local or regional examples. The text accompanying question 13-24 also provides context, indicating that the subsequent three chapters will delve into the "promotion" element of the marketing mix.
