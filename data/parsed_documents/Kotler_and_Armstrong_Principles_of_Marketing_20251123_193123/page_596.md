Such adaptation often plays out across multiple L’Oréal brands—which takes us back to that Korean skin beautifier sold under a French brand in Australia mentioned in the opening paragraph. Blemish balm cream (BB cream) was originally created by dermatologists in Korea to soothe skin and hide minor blemishes. It quickly became a high-flying Korean brand. However, applying their deep knowledge of skin colors, treatments, and makeup worldwide, L’Oréal researchers developed a successful new-generation BB cream adapted to conditions and skin colors in U.S. markets (where *BB* stands for “beauty balm”) and launched it under the Maybelline New York brand. Still not finished, L’Oréal created yet another local version for Europe under the Garnier brand, which it also introduced in other world markets, including Australia.

L’Oréal’s global R&D efforts have produced a “geography of skin colors”—a proprietary mapping of the world that makes it possible to adapt cosmetic products to the needs of women around the world. In a similar manner, the company has expanded the traditional classification of three hair types (African, Asian, and European) to eight different categories, based on a scientific measurement of curl characteristics that includes the diameter of the curvature, the curl index, the number of waves, and tendrils.

L’Oréal doesn’t just adapt its product formulations globally. It also adapts brand positioning and marketing to international needs and expectations. For example, more than 20 years ago, the company bought stodgy American makeup producer Maybelline. To reinvigorate and globalize the brand, it moved the unit’s headquarters from Tennessee to New York City and added “New York” to the label. The resulting urban, street-smart, Big Apple image played well globally with the midprice positioning of the workaday makeup brand. The makeover soon earned Maybelline a 20 percent market share in its category in Western Europe. The young urban positioning also hit the mark in Asia, where few women realized that the trendy “New York” Maybelline brand belonged to French cosmetics giant L’Oréal.

By acquiring brands such as Maybelline, L’Oréal also gains brands that have immediate recognition and products already made for a given market. This gives the company an immediate point of entry to a market at a cost that is lower than building a brand from scratch. Such is the case with Yue-Sai Cosmetics, a Chinese company that uses herbs in its creams. L’Oréal bought it a decade ago. Sales of Yue-Sai products increased by 20 percent last year.

L’Oréal and its brands are truly global, and its approach to providing luxury beauty for the masses is working. Total revenues have grown by 30 percent over the past four years. Even as the Western European market growth has slowed and Brazil is in a slump, L’Oréal’s revenues climbed by 12 percent in the past year alone. In the United States, L’Oréal is growing even as key rival Unilever has seen its revenue decline and is losing market share.

L’Oréal’s huge international success comes from achieving a global–local balance that adapts and differentiates brands in local markets while optimizing their impact across global markets. L’Oréal is one of few companies that has achieved both local brand responsiveness and global brand integration. “We respect the differences among our consumers around the world,” says L’Oréal’s CEO. “We have global brands, but we need to adapt them to local needs.” When a former CEO once addressed a UNESCO conference, nobody batted an eyelid when he described L’Oréal as “The United Nations of Beauty.”
