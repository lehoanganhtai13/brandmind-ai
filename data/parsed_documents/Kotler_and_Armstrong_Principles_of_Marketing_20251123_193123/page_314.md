# CHAPTER 10 | Pricing: Understanding and Capturing Customer Value

LEGO has successfully redefined its overall positioning strategy and value proposition, and has returned to core values that have resonated with its customers. Its overall positioning strategy is not to be the cheapest and compete with low-cost producers via the price but by being the best in terms of product quality. This positioning strategy, called more-for-more positioning, involves offering the most upscale product and charging a higher price to cover the higher costs. The truth, LEGO discovered, is that innovations, an overall positioning strategy, and a customer-focused value proposition need to exist synergistically not only with each other, but also within the context of the company’s history, circumstances, and core values. Thinking “outside the box” pushed LEGO away from its customers and almost put it out of business. The LEGO Group regained its footing when it began to think once again inside the box, or in this case, the brick. In an industry and environment that can change so rapidly, constant vigilance and continuous analysis are key in the framework of successful positioning. Thanks to the repositioning of the LEGO brand and the incessant development of its value proposition, TLG continues to thrive.  
From 2005 until today, the company has reported profits and has gained even wider appeal through licensed partnerships. It got a particular bump in 2014 from the success of *The LEGO Movie*, an animated feature that grossed nearly $500 million worldwide.  

Full-year 2015 results showed a 25 percent increase in revenue to DKK 35.7 billion (about $5.0472 billion) and a profit before tax of DKK 12.1 billion (about $1.7136 billion). In 2015, LEGO topped the global ranking of the most powerful brands conducted by the consultancy Brand Finance. It looks like everything is awesome again for LEGO.

> Costs set the floor for price, but the goal isn’t always to *minimize* costs. In fact, many firms invest in higher costs so that they can claim higher prices and margins (think back about Patek Philippe watches). The key is to manage the *spread* between costs and prices—how much the company makes for the customer value it delivers.

## Cost-Based Pricing

Whereas customer value perceptions set the price ceiling, costs set the floor for the price that the company can charge. **Cost-based pricing** involves setting prices based on the costs of producing, distributing, and selling the product plus a fair rate of return for the company’s effort and risk. A company’s costs may be an important element in its pricing strategy.

Some companies, such as Walmart or Spirit Airlines, work to become the *low-cost producers* in their industries. Companies with lower costs can set lower prices that result in smaller margins but greater sales and profits. However, other companies—such as Apple, BMW, and Steinway—intentionally pay higher costs so that they can add value and claim higher prices and margins. For example, it costs more to make a “handcrafted” Steinway piano than a Yamaha production model. But the higher costs result in higher quality, justifying an average $87,000 price. To those who buy a Steinway, price is nothing; the Steinway experience is everything. The key is to manage the spread between costs and prices—how much the company makes for the customer value it delivers.

### Types of Costs

A company’s costs take two forms: fixed and variable. **Fixed costs** (also known as *overhead*) are costs that do not vary with production or sales level. For example, a company must pay each month’s bills for rent, heat, interest, and executive salaries regardless of the company’s level of output. **Variable costs** vary directly with the level of production. Each smartphone or tablet produced by Samsung involves a cost of computer chips, wires, plastic, packaging, and other inputs. Although these costs tend to be the same for each unit produced, they are called variable costs because the total varies with the number of units produced. **Total costs** are the sum of the fixed and variable costs for any given level of production. Management wants to charge a price that will at least cover the total production costs at a given level of production.

The company must watch its costs carefully. If it costs the company more than its competitors to produce and sell a similar product, the company will need to charge a higher price or make less profit, putting it at a competitive disadvantage.

### Definitions

This table outlines the fundamental components of cost-based pricing, a strategy where product prices are determined by production, distribution, and selling expenses, augmented by a reasonable profit margin to account for effort and risk. The core elements include fixed costs, also known as overhead, which remain constant regardless of production or sales volume. In contrast, variable costs fluctuate directly with the level of production. Finally, total costs represent the aggregate of both fixed and variable costs at any specific production output. This structure establishes a clear relationship between different cost categories and their impact on overall pricing decisions.
