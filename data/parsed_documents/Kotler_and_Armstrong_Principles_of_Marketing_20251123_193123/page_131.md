Patent Office and Trademark database reveals patents that competitors have filed. For a fee, companies can also subscribe to any of the more than 3,000 online databases and information search services, such as Hoover’s, LexisNexis, and Dun & Bradstreet. Today’s marketers have an almost overwhelming amount of competitor information only a few keystrokes away.

The intelligence game goes both ways. Facing determined competitive marketing intelligence efforts by competitors, most companies take steps to protect their own information. One self-admitted corporate spy advises that companies should try conducting marketing intelligence investigations of themselves, looking for potentially damaging information leaks. They should start by “vacuuming up” everything they can find in the public record, including job postings, court records, company advertisements and blogs, web pages, press releases, online business reports, social media postings by customers and employees, and other information available to inquisitive competitors.⁷

The growing use of marketing intelligence also raises ethical issues. Some intelligence-gathering techniques may involve questionable ethics. Clearly, companies should take advantage of publicly available information. However, they should not stoop to snoop. With all the legitimate intelligence sources now available, a company does not need to break the law or accepted codes of ethics to get good intelligence.

### Marketing Research

In addition to marketing intelligence information about general consumer, competitor, and marketplace happenings, marketers often need formal studies that provide customer and market insights for specific marketing situations and decisions. For example, Starbucks wants to know how customers would react to a new breakfast menu item. Yahoo! wants to know how web searchers will react to a proposed redesign of its site. Or Samsung wants to know how many and what kinds of people will buy its next-generation, ultrathin televisions. In such situations, managers will need marketing research.

**Marketing research** is the systematic design, collection, analysis, and reporting of data relevant to a specific marketing situation facing an organization. Companies use marketing research in a wide variety of situations. For example, marketing research gives marketers insights into customer motivations, purchase behavior, and satisfaction. It can help them to assess market potential and market share or measure the effectiveness of pricing, product, distribution, and promotion activities.

Some large companies have their own research departments that work with marketing managers on marketing research projects. In addition, these companies—like their smaller counterparts—frequently hire outside research specialists to consult with management on specific marketing problems and to conduct marketing research studies. Sometimes firms simply purchase data collected by outside firms to aid in their decision making.

The marketing research process has four steps (see **Figure 4.2**): defining the problem and research objectives, developing the research plan, implementing the research plan, and interpreting and reporting the findings.

### Defining the Problem and Research Objectives

Marketing managers and researchers must work together closely to define the problem and agree on research objectives. The manager best understands the decision for which information is needed, whereas the researcher best understands marketing research and how to obtain the information. Defining the problem and research objectives is often the hardest step in the research process. The manager may know that something is wrong without knowing the specific causes.

> This first step is probably the most difficult but also the most important one. It guides the entire research process. It’s frustrating and costly to reach the end of an expensive research project only to learn that you’ve addressed the wrong problem!

This table outlines a four-stage research process, presented sequentially. The first stage involves **Defining the problem and research objectives**, establishing the foundational scope and goals of the inquiry. This is followed by **Developing the research plan for collecting information**, which details the methodology and strategies for gathering relevant data. The third stage, **Implementing the research plan—collecting and analyzing the data**, focuses on the execution of the plan, encompassing the actual data acquisition and subsequent examination. Finally, the process culminates in **Interpreting and reporting the findings**, where the analyzed data is understood and communicated. The structure is linear and process-oriented, guiding the researcher through distinct phases from initial conceptualization to final dissemination. After the problem has been defined carefully, the manager and the researcher must set the research objectives.
