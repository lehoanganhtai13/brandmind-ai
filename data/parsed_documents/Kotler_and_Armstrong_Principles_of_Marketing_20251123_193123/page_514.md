# Chapter 17 Direct, Online, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing

In previous chapters, we discussed direct marketing as direct distribution—as marketing channels that contain no intermediaries. We also included direct and digital marketing elements of the promotion mix—as an approach for engaging consumers directly and creating brand community. In actuality, direct marketing is both of these things and much more.

Most companies still use direct marketing as a supplementary channel or medium. Thus, most department stores, such as Sears or Macy’s, sell the majority of their merchandise off their store shelves, but they also sell through direct mail, online catalogs, and social media pages. Pepsi’s Mountain Dew brand markets heavily through mass-media advertising and its retail partners’ channels. However, it also supplements these channels with a heavy dose of direct marketing. Mountain Dew’s marketing mix consists of 55 percent television advertising and 45 percent digital. It uses its several brand websites and a long list of social media to engage its digitally connected customer community in everything from designing their own Mountain Dew lifestyle pages to deciding which limited-edition flavors should be launched or retired. Through such direct interactions, Mountain Dew has created one of the most passionately loyal fan bases of any brand, which in turn has made it the nation’s fourth-largest soft drink brand.²

However, for many companies today, direct and digital marketing are more than just supplementary channels or advertising media—they constitute a complete model for doing business. Firms employing this direct model use it as the only approach. Companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, eBay, Netflix, GEICO, and Priceline.com have successfully built their entire approach to the marketplace around direct and digital marketing.

For example, Priceline.com, the online travel company, sells its services exclusively through online, mobile, and social media channels. Priceline.com and other online travel agency competitors such as Expedia and Orbitz have pretty much driven traditional offline travel agencies to extinction.³

## Rapid Growth of Direct and Digital Marketing

Direct and digital marketing have become the fastest-growing form of marketing. According to one source, U.S. companies will spend an estimated $163 billion on direct and digital marketing this year, up more than 6 percent over the previous year. Direct marketing continues to become more internet-based, and digital direct marketing is claiming a surging share of marketing spending and sales. For example, U.S. marketers will spend an estimated $60 billion on digital advertising last year, up 20 percent over the previous year. Total digital advertising spending—including online display and search advertising, social media, mobile, video, email, and other—now accounts for the largest share of media spending, overtaking even television spending. And as consumers spend more and more time on their tablets and smartphones, ad spending on mobile advertising is exploding. Last year alone, mobile ad spending grew by 66 percent, and by 2019 it will account for an expected 29 percent of total U.S. ad spending.⁴ For buyers, direct and digital marketing are convenient, easy, and private.
