# The Global Marketplace

Further, India’s few large domestic retailers are not bound by the same rule, making it difficult for Walmart to compete profitably. Walmart is now looking for a domestic partner that can help it crack the mammoth Indian market.⁷  
At the same time, certain other forces can *help* trade between nations. Examples include the World Trade Organization (WTO) and various regional free trade agreements.

## The World Trade Organization

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established in 1947 and modified in 1994, was designed to promote world trade by reducing tariffs and other international trade barriers.  
🔵 It established the World Trade Organization (WTO), which replaced GATT in 1995 and now oversees the original GATT provisions. WTO and GATT member nations (currently numbering 162) have met in eight rounds of negotiations to reassess trade barriers and establish new rules for international trade. The WTO also imposes international trade sanctions and mediates global trade disputes. Its actions have been productive. The first seven rounds of negotiations reduced the average worldwide tariffs on manufactured goods from 45 percent to just 5 percent.⁸

The most recently completed negotiations, dubbed the Uruguay Round, took a long seven years before concluding in 1994. The benefits of the Uruguay Round will be felt for many years, as the accord promoted long-term global trade growth, reduced the world’s remaining merchandise tariffs by 30 percent, extended the WTO to cover trade in agriculture and a wide range of services, and toughened the international protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property. A new round of global WTO trade talks, the Doha Round, began in Doha, Qatar, in late 2001 and was set to conclude in 2005; however, the discussions still continued through 2016. The Doha round covers a gamut of trade issues from intellectual property to agriculture.⁹

## Regional Free Trade Zones

Certain countries have formed *free trade zones* or **economic communities**. These are groups of nations organized to work toward common goals in the regulation of international trade. One such community is the *European Union (EU)*. Formed in 1957, the EU set out to create a single European market by reducing barriers to the free flow of products, services, finances, and labor among member countries and developing policies on trade with nonmember nations. Today, the EU represents one of the world’s largest single markets.  
🔵 Currently, it has 28 member countries containing more than half a billion consumers and accounting for almost 16 percent of the world’s imports and exports.¹⁰ The EU offers tremendous trade opportunities for U.S. and other non-European firms.

Over the past decade and a half, 19 EU member nations have adopted the euro as a common currency. Widespread adoption of the euro decreased much of the currency risk associated with doing business in Europe, making member countries with previously weak currencies more attractive markets. However, the adoption of a common currency has also caused problems, as European economic powers such as Germany and France have had to step in recently to prop up weaker economies such as those of Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus. This recent ongoing “euro crisis” has led some analysts to predict the possible breakup of the euro zone as it is now set up.¹¹

It is unlikely that the EU will ever go against 2,000 years of tradition and become the “United States of Europe.” A community with more than two dozen different languages and cultures and a history of sometimes strained relationships will always have
