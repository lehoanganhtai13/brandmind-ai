fixed costs. Break-even volume represents the level of output at which all (variable and fixed) costs are covered. In HD’s case, break-even unit volume is:

$$
\text{Break-even volume} = \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{price} - \text{variable cost}} = \frac{20,000,000}{168 - 125} = 465,116.2 \text{ units}
$$

Thus, at the given cost and pricing structure, HD will break even at 465,117 units.  
To determine the break-even dollar sales, simply multiply unit break-even volume by the selling price:

$$
\text{BE sales} = \text{BE}_{vol} \times \text{price} = 465,117 \times 168 = 78,139,656
$$

Another way to calculate dollar break-even sales is to use the percentage contribution margin (hereafter referred to as **contribution margin**), which is the unit contribution divided by the selling price:

> **Contribution margin**  
> The unit contribution divided by the selling price.

$$
\text{Contribution margin} = \frac{\text{price} - \text{variable cost}}{\text{price}} = \frac{168 - 125}{168} = 0.256 \text{ or } 25.6\%
$$

Then,

$$
\text{Break-even sales} = \frac{\text{fixed costs}}{\text{contribution margin}} = \frac{20,000,000}{0.256} = 78,125,000
$$

Note that the difference between the two break-even sales calculations is due to rounding.  
Such break-even analysis helps HD by showing the unit volume needed to cover costs. If production capacity cannot attain this level of output, then the company should not launch this product. However, the unit break-even volume is well within HD’s capacity. Of course, the bigger question concerns whether HD can sell this volume at the $168 price. We’ll address that issue a little later.

Understanding contribution margin is useful in other types of analyses as well, particularly if unit prices and unit variable costs are unknown or if a company (say, a retailer) sells many products at different prices and knows the percentage of total sales variable costs represent. Whereas unit contribution is the difference between unit price and unit variable costs, total contribution is the difference between total sales and total variable costs. The overall contribution margin can be calculated by:

$$
\text{Contribution margin} = \frac{\text{total sales} - \text{total variable costs}}{\text{total sales}}
$$

Regardless of the actual level of sales, if the company knows what percentage of sales is represented by variable costs, it can calculate contribution margin. For example, HD’s unit variable cost is $125, or 74% of the selling price ($125 \div 168 = 0.74$). That means for every $1 of sales revenue for HD, $0.74 represents variable costs, and the difference ($0.26) represents contribution to fixed costs. But even if the company doesn’t know its unit price and unit variable cost, it can calculate the contribution margin from total sales and total variable costs or from knowledge of the total cost structure. It can set total sales equal to 100% regardless of the actual absolute amount and determine the contribution margin:

$$
\text{Contribution margin} = \frac{100\% - 74\%}{100\%} = \frac{1 - 0.74}{1} = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \text{ or } 26\%
$$

Note that this matches the percentage calculated from the unit price and unit variable cost information. This alternative calculation will be very useful later when analyzing various marketing decisions.

## Determining “Breakeven” for Profit Goals

Although it is useful to know the break-even point, most companies are more interested in making a profit. Assume HD would like to realize a $5 million profit in the first year. How many must it sell at the $168 price to cover fixed costs and produce this profit? To determine this, HD can simply add the profit figure to fixed costs and again divide by the unit contribution to determine unit sales:

$$
\text{Unit volume} = \frac{\text{fixed cost} + \text{profit goal}}{\text{price} - \text{variable cost}} = \frac{20,000,000 + 5,000,000}{168 - 125} = 581,395.3 \text{ units}
$$ Thus, to earn a $5 million profit, HD must sell 581,396 units.
