# Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

Personality can be useful in analyzing consumer behavior for certain product or brand choices.

The idea is that brands also have personalities, and consumers are likely to choose brands with personalities that match their own. A *brand personality* is the specific mix of human traits that may be attributed to a particular brand. One researcher identified five brand personality traits: **sincerity** (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), **excitement** (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up-to-date), **competence** (reliable, intelligent, and successful), **sophistication** (glamorous, upper class, charming), and **ruggedness** (outdoorsy and tough). “Your personality determines what you consume, what TV shows you watch, what products you buy, and [most] other decisions you make,” says one consumer behavior expert.  

Most well-known brands are strongly associated with a particular trait: the Ford F150 with “ruggedness,” Apple with “excitement,” the *Washington Post* with “competence,” Method with “sincerity,” and Gucci with “class and sophistication.” Many brands build their positioning and brand stories around such traits. For example, fast-growing lifestyle brand Shinola has crafted an “authentic, built in Detroit” persona that has made it one of America’s hottest brands (see Real Marketing 5.2).

Many marketers use a concept related to personality—a person’s *self-concept* (also called *self-image*). The idea is that people’s possessions contribute to and reflect their identities—that is, “we are what we consume.” Thus, to understand consumer behavior, marketers must first understand the relationship between consumer self-concept and possessions.

Hence, brands will attract people who are high on the same personality traits. For example, the MINI automobile has an instantly recognizable personality as a clever and sassy but powerful little car. MINI owners—who sometimes call themselves “MINIacs”—have a strong and emotional connection with their cars. More than targeting specific demographic segments, MINI appeals to personality segments—to people who are “adventurous, individualistic, open-minded, creative, tech-savvy, and young at heart,” just like the car.

## Psychological Factors

A person’s buying choices are further influenced by four major psychological factors: *motivation*, *perception*, *learning*, and *beliefs and attitudes*.

### Motivation

A person has many needs at any given time. Some are biological, arising from states of tension such as hunger, thirst, or discomfort. Others are psychological, arising from the need for recognition, esteem, or belonging. A need becomes a motive when it is aroused to a sufficient level of intensity. A **motive (or drive)** is a need that is sufficiently pressing to direct the person to seek satisfaction. Psychologists have developed theories of human motivation. Two of the most popular—the theories of Sigmund Freud and Abraham Maslow—carry quite different meanings for consumer analysis and marketing.

Sigmund Freud assumed that people are largely unconscious about the real psychological forces shaping their behavior. His theory suggests that a person’s buying decisions are affected by subconscious motives that even the buyer may not fully understand. Thus, an aging baby boomer who buys a sporty BMW convertible might explain that he simply likes the feel of the wind in his thinning hair. At a deeper level, he may be trying to impress others with his success. At a still deeper level, he may be buying the car to feel young and independent again.

Consumers often don’t know or can’t describe why they act as they do. Thus, many companies employ teams of psychologists, anthropologists, and other social scientists to carry out *motivation research* that probes the subconscious motivations underlying

The provided text defines "Motive (drive)" as a pressing need that compels an individual to seek its satisfaction. This definition is followed by an anecdote about a *Jimmy Kimmel Live* comedy sketch. The sketch involved a mock game show where contestants identified which of two luxury products was inferior ("sh*t") and which was superior ("Shinola"). The implication is that the distinction between the products was obvious, suggesting a clear difference in perceived value or quality, which could be linked to underlying consumer motives or desires. The anecdote serves as a lighthearted illustration, though its direct connection to the formal definition of "motive" is tangential, focusing more on product perception than the psychological drive itself.
