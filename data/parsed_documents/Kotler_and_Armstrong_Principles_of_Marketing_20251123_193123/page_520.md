# Direct, Online, Social Media, and Mobile Marketing

The explosion of **spam**—unsolicited, unwanted commercial email messages that clog up our email boxes—has produced consumer irritation and frustration. According to one source, spam now accounts for about half of the billions of emails sent worldwide each day. Workers in American businesses send and receive nearly 109 billion emails per day and spend nearly one-third of their workweek managing email.[^16] Email marketers walk a fine line between adding value for consumers and being intrusive and annoying.

To address these concerns, most legitimate marketers now practice *permission-based email marketing*, sending email pitches only to customers who “opt in.” Many companies use configurable email systems that let customers choose what they want to get. Amazon targets opt-in customers with a limited number of helpful “we thought you’d like to know” messages based on their expressed preferences and previous purchases. Few customers object, and many actually welcome such promotional messages. Amazon benefits through higher return rates and by avoiding alienating customers with emails they don’t want. In fact, in the recent SPAMMY awards, which each year recognize the worst email abusers but also the most liked, Amazon topped the most-popular email subscriptions list for the second year in a row.[^17]

## Online Videos

Another form of online marketing is posting digital video content on brand websites or on social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Vine, and others. Some videos are made specifically for the web and social media. Such videos range from “how-to” instructional videos and public relations pieces to brand promotions and brand-related entertainment. Other videos are ads that a company makes primarily for TV and other media but posts online before or after an advertising campaign to extend their reach and impact.

Good online videos can engage consumers by the tens of millions. The online video audience is soaring. Almost 75 percent of the U.S. population has viewed online videos. YouTube users now upload more than 500 hours of video every minute. Facebook alone generates 8 billion video views per day worldwide; Snapchat adds another 6 billion views.[^18]

Marketers hope that some of their videos will go viral. **Viral marketing**, the digital version of word-of-mouth marketing, involves creating videos, ads, and other marketing content that are so infectious that customers will seek them out or pass them along to their friends. Because customers find and pass along the content, viral marketing can be very inexpensive. And when content comes from a friend, the recipient is much more likely to view or read it.

All kinds of videos can go viral, producing engagement and positive exposure for a brand. 🔵 For example, Google Android launched a compellingly sharable video called “Friends Furever,” which featured unlikely pairings of animals—an orangutan and a dog, a bear and a tiger, a cat and a duckling—being pals and enjoying life together. The video was the latest installment in Android’s two-year-old “Be together. Not the same.” marketing campaign. The campaign highlights how people can be different and still be stronger together, in line with Android’s core competency of running on diverse devices, each with its own design and features. The heartwarming “Friends Furever” video went viral in a big way. It captured more than 24 million YouTube views and was shared more than 6.4 million times across Facebook, Twitter, and the blogosphere in its first nine months, making it the most-shared video of all time.[^19]

Many brands produce multi-platform video campaigns that bridge traditional TV, online, and mobile media. For example, Adidas’s recent “Take It” campaign—a series of action-packed 60-second video ads featuring famous Adidas
