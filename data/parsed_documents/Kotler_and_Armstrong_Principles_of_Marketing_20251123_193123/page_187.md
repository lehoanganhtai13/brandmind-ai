# 6 Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

> **CHAPTER PREVIEW**  
> In the previous chapter, you studied *final consumer* buying behavior and factors that influence it. In this chapter, we’ll do the same for **business customers**—those that buy goods and services for use in producing their own products and services or for resale to others.  
> As when selling to final buyers, firms marketing to businesses must engage business customers and build profitable relationships with them by creating superior customer value.  
> To start, let’s look at IBM. Although the IBM brand is very familiar to most final consumers, nearly all of the company’s almost $100 billion in annual revenues comes from business and institutional customers. More than just “selling” its products and services to B-to-B customers, IBM succeeds by working closely and deeply with them to develop complete solutions to their information and data analytics problems. From its lofty customer-solutions mission to the “boots on the ground,” IBM wants to become a strategic information and insights partner with its business customers.

## IBM: The World’s Most Valuable Business-to-Business Brand

IBM is a household word to most of us. However, throughout its long history, IBM’s fortunes have come not from final consumers but from large business and institutional customers. “Big Blue”—as it’s often called—is the quintessential B-to-B brand. In fact, corporate brand tracker Millward Brown recently named IBM the most valuable B-to-B brand in the world. Valued at $94 billion, IBM is worth about 50 percent more than the number-two B-to-B brand, giant GE. Even more impressive, IBM has survived and thrived for more than 100 years, something no other *Fortune* top-25 company has managed.

In some ways, IBM selling B-to-B is like P&G selling to final consumers. It requires a deep-down understanding of customer needs and a customer-driven marketing strategy that engages customers and delivers superior customer value. But that’s where most of the similarities end. Rather than selling small-ticket purchases to masses of individual consumers, IBM sells complex big-ticket purchases to a smaller set of much bigger buyers, with each purchase involving perhaps dozens of decision makers. So IBM’s B-to-B emphasis is less on selling *to* customers and more on partnering *with* them to help solve their complex information and analytics problems.

> IBM has become the world’s most valuable business-to-business brand by solving customer problems and helping them to “outthink” their challenges, competitors, and limits in the new cognitive era.

Solving customer problems has always been a hallmark of IBM’s strategy, culture, and success. Over the years, IBM has transformed itself time and again to meet changing customer needs. For example, two decades ago, IBM was known mostly for peddling mainframe computers, PCs, and other basic computer system components. Back then, if you’d asked top managers at Big Blue what their mission was, they’d have answered, “To sell computer hardware and software.”

By the early 1990s, however, IBM’s sales had plateaued. To learn why, IBM sent its top managers to meet face-to-face with important customers—what it called “bear-hugging customers”—to relearn about their problems and priorities. The managers learned that in the new connected digital age, companies face a perplexing array of data and information technologies. Today’s customers don’t need just computers and software. Instead, they need total solutions to ever-more-bewildering data, information, and analytics problems.

This realization led to a fundamental transformation of IBM’s business. Now, if you ask IBM managers to define the company’s mission, they’ll tell you, “We deliver *insights* and *solutions* to customers’ data and information technology problems.” Under this new customer-solutions focus, IBM shifted emphasis away from mainframes and computer hardware.
