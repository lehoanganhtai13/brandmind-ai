# 20.2 CVS Health: Balancing Purpose with Profit

It was a risky decision. Although it won high praise from health advocates and public officials, stubbing out cigarettes resulted in the immediate loss of $2 billion in annual tobacco sales, and it risked driving a significant portion of CVS’s smoking customers to competitors such as Walgreens, Rite-Aid, Walmart, or Kroger, all of which continued to sell cigarettes.

But to CVS, dropping tobacco was pretty much a no-brainer. CVS is on an important mission: “Millions of times a day, close to home and across the country, we’re helping people on their path to better health,” says CVS. Selling cigarettes *and* helping people on their path to better health? The two simply didn’t jibe with one another. So CVS pulled tobacco products from its shelves. “CVS quits for good,” the company announced. “This is the right thing to do.”

Stopping tobacco sales was a landmark moment for CVS. And it was the event that received most of the headlines. However, the ban on tobacco was only one step in a more sweeping purpose-driven transformation. Consistent with its broader mission, CVS has been on a decade-long shift from being the traditional “drug store on the corner” to becoming a “multi-spectrum health care company.” In fact, CVS no longer considers itself just a retail pharmacy. Rather, it sees itself as a pharmacy innovation company. “We’re reinventing pharmacy to have a more active, supportive role in each person’s unique health experience and in the greater health care environment,” says the company.

Underscoring this commitment, at the same time that CVS suspended tobacco sales, it changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health. And true to its mission and new name, CVS Health now offers a full range of products and services that help people on their path to better health. It all starts, of course, with CVS Health’s network of 9,600 retail pharmacies, which sell an extensive assortment of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals, personal care products, health and beauty aids, and general merchandise. CVS/pharmacy dispenses more prescriptions than any other drugstore chain, and prescriptions account for 71 percent of the chain’s retail sales. More than 1,100 CVS locations also house a CVS MinuteClinic, where medical professionals treat minor health conditions, give vaccinations, and provide other walk-in care.

CVS Health’s pursuit of its “path to better health” mission extends well beyond retail pharmacies. For example, the company’s CVS Caremark division provides Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) services that help big companies and insurers manage their prescription-drug programs. CVS Caremark helps clients to manage costs while improving health outcomes for 75 million Caremark members. CVS Health recently acquired Coram, which provides home infusion services to homebound patients, and Omnicare, a distributor of prescription drugs to nursing home and assisted-living facilities. The company has also broadened its range of customer contact activities to include tailored in-store and phone advising to customers managing chronic and specialty health conditions. In all, these days, CVS likes to think of itself as a kind of one-stop shop for health care.

Beyond these products and services, CVS Health also takes an active role in health-care management through research, consumer outreach and education, and support of health-related programs and organizations. For example, it has joined forces with a variety of organizations in efforts to curb tobacco use in the United States. It has partnered with the American Cancer Society and the National Urban League to lobby for anti-tobacco legislation, and with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and Scholastic, Inc. on tobacco-related education.

CVS recently launched a five-year, $50 million “Be the First” campaign by which it will work with national health organizations and youth groups to combat smoking through education, advocacy, tobacco control, and healthy behavior programming. “We are at a critical moment in our nation’s efforts to end the epidemic of tobacco use that . . . threatens the health and well-being of our next generation,” says CVS Health’s chief medical officer. “We’re partnering with experts across the public health community . . . to move us one step closer to delivering the first tobacco-free generation.”

So how is sense-of-mission marketing working for CVS Health? An interesting thing happened after the company stopped selling tobacco products in 2014. Although front-of-store sales dropped that year, overall CVS revenues increased by nearly 10 percent. And in the following year, revenues jumped another 10 percent. It appears that the loss of revenues from tobacco products has been more than offset by revenues from new sources, including those resulting from the decision to quit selling cigarettes.

Strange as it sounds, one source of new sales is smokers themselves. It turns out that 70 percent of smokers want to quit. At the same time that CVS Health pulled cigarettes off its shelves, it launched a “Let’s
