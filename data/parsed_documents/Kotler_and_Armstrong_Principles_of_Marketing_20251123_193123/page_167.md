Disney looks for influential moms who fit the brand’s family-friendly focus, use social media heavily, and are active in their communities offline as well as online. One example is Rachel Pitzel, a mother of two and CEO of ClubMomMe, a social and educational group that sponsors events for moms, expectant parents, and families and maintains an active blog. Another is Wendy Wright, a homeschooling mother of two and a prolific blogger. Wendy describes herself as a “Disney nut” (she named her cats Mickey and Minnie), and she fills her blog with advice for planning Disney park visits, tips for holding Disney-themed parties, and reviews of Disney movies.

Disney Social Media Moms aren’t paid; they participate because of their passion and enthusiasm for all things Disney. However, they do receive special educational attention from Disney, inside information, and occasional perks. For example, every year, Disney invites 175 to 200 of the moms and their families for a deeply discounted, four-day trip to attend its annual Disney Social Media Moms Celebration in Florida. The celebration is a mix of public relations event, educational conference, and family vacation with plenty of Disney magic for these important mom influencers.

The Disney Social Media Moms are under no obligation to post anything about Disney, and the company doesn’t tell them what to say when they do post. However, the most recent celebration generated 28,500 tweets, 4,900 Instagram photos, and 88 blog posts full of ride reviews, videos of families meeting Disney characters, and a host of overwhelmingly positive comments. “For a big chunk of our guests, it’s the moms who are making [travel] decisions,” says a top Disney executive. The Disney Social Media Moms effort costs the company very little but effectively harnesses the power of mom-to-mom influence to help sprinkle Disney’s magical pixie dust on an important group of buyers.

get it, get Go-Gurt.” And a recent General Mills “How to Dad” campaign for Cheerios presents a dad as a multitasking superhero around the house, a departure from the bumbling dad stereotypes often shown in food ads. This dad does all the right things, including feeding his children healthy Cheerios breakfasts. “Being a dad is awesome,” he proclaims in one ad. “Just like Cheerios are awesome. That’s why it’s the Official Cereal of Dadhood.”[^18]

Children also have a strong influence on family buying decisions. ● A global survey showed that children—from babies to teens—wield particular influence over their parents’ decisions regarding how money and free time are spent (71 and 70 percent), where to go on vacation (64 percent), how often to go out to eat (58 percent), and where to live (43 percent). Furthermore, the majority of parents felt that their kids exert more influence on family purchases than they did themselves when growing up.[^19]

## Roles and Status

A person belongs to many groups—family, clubs, organizations, online communities. The person’s position in each group can be defined in terms of both role and status. A role consists of the activities people are expected to perform according to the people around them. Each role carries a status reflecting the general esteem given to it by society.

People usually choose products appropriate to their roles and status. Consider the various roles a working mother plays. In her company, she may play the role of a brand manager; in her family, she plays the role of wife and mother; at her favorite sporting events, she plays the role of avid fan. As a brand manager, she will buy the kind of clothing that reflects her role and status in her company. At the game, she may wear clothing supporting her favorite team.
