Ryanair’s focus on cost reduction has resulted in significantly higher profit margins than those of rival EasyJet. Some of the cost savings are passed on to the customers in the form of lower fares (the plan is an average fall in fare levels of 5 percent per year) to make the airline even more attractive to its target market, which is the leisure customer.

The stellar growth in low-cost flying and dynamic pricing has attracted new entrants, such as Flybe, Jett, and Goodjet in Europe, as well as AirAsia Berhad, a Malaysian low-cost airline headquartered near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and operating domestic and international flights to 100 destinations spanning 22 countries. Traditional airlines have also responded. For example, Air France, Lufthansa, and British Airways have cut prices on many of their European flights in an attempt to stem the flow to the low-price carriers. However, their prices remain significantly higher than those of Ryanair and EasyJet due to their different cost structures and more traditional pricing strategies.

Ryanair and EasyJet have successfully implemented and pursued their low-cost approach and dynamic pricing, and revolutionized the airline industry. They have proven that companies can provide customer value in more ways than one. If they manage to sustain their development, not even the sky’s the limit.

Consumers must now devise strategies to deal with the consumer practice of **showrooming**. Consumers armed with smartphones now routinely visit stores to see an item, compare prices online while in the store, and then request price matches or simply buy the item online at a lower price. Such behavior is called showrooming because consumers use retailers’ stores as de facto “showrooms” for online resellers such as Amazon.com.

Store retailers are now implementing strategies to combat such showrooming and cross-channel shopping or even turn it into an advantage. For example, Best Buy now routinely matches the prices of Amazon and other major online merchants. Once it has neutralized price as a buying factor, Best Buy reasons, it can convert showroomers into in-store buyers with its nonprice advantages, such as immediacy, convenient locations, personal assistance by well-trained associates, and the ability to order goods online and pick up or return them in the store. It has also sharpened its own online and mobile marketing. “Showrooming . . . is not the ideal experience,” says a Best Buy marketer, “to do research at home, go to the store, do more research, then…order and hope it arrives on time. There’s a better way.”[^14] We will revisit the subject of showrooming in our discussions of retailing in Chapter 13.

## International Pricing

Companies that market their products internationally must decide what prices to charge in different countries. In some cases, a company can set a uniform worldwide price. For example, Boeing sells its jetliners at about the same price everywhere, whether the buyer is in the United States, Europe, or a third-world country. However, most companies adjust their prices to reflect local market conditions and cost considerations.

The price that a company should charge in a specific country depends on many factors, including economic conditions, competitive situations, laws and regulations, and the nature of the wholesaling and retailing system. Consumer perceptions and preferences also may vary from country to country, calling for different prices. Or the company may have different marketing objectives in various world markets, which require changes in pricing strategy. For example, Apple uses a premium pricing strategy.
