“I hate” and “sucks” sites are almost commonplace. These sites target some highly respected companies with some highly disrespectful labels: Walmartblows.com, PayPalSucks.com (aka NoPayPal), IHateStarbucks.com, DeltaREALLYsucks.com, and UnitedPackageSmashers.com (UPS), to name only a few. “Sucks” videos on YouTube and other video sites also abound. For example, a search of “Apple sucks” on YouTube turns up more than 600,000 videos; a search for Microsoft finds 143,000 videos. An “Apple sucks” search on Facebook links to hundreds of groups. If you don’t find one you like, try “Apple suks” or “Apple sux” for hundreds more.

Some of these sites, videos, and other online attacks air legitimate complaints that should be addressed. Others, however, are little more than anonymous, vindictive slurs that unfairly ransack brands and corporate reputations. Some of the attacks are only a passing nuisance; others can draw serious attention and create real headaches.

How should companies react to online attacks? The real quandary for targeted companies is figuring out how far they can go to protect their images without fueling the already-raging fire. One point on which all experts seem to agree: Don’t try to retaliate in kind. “It’s rarely a good idea to lob bombs at the fire starters,” says one analyst. “Preemption, engagement, and diplomacy are saner tools.” Such criticisms are often based on real consumer concerns and unresolved anger. Hence, the best strategy might be to proactively monitor these sites and respond honestly to the concerns they express.

For example, Boeing quickly took responsibility for mishandling aspiring Harry Winsor’s designs, turning a potential PR disaster into a positive. It called and invited young Harry to visit Boeing’s facilities. On its corporate Twitter site, it confessed, “We’re experts at airplanes but novices in social media. We’re learning as we go.” In response to its Figo ad fiasco, Ford’s chief marketing officer issued a deep public apology, citing that Ford had not approved the ads and that it had since modified its ad review process. Ford’s ad agency promptly fired the guilty creatives.

Similarly, FedEx drew praise by immediately posting its own YouTube video addressing the monitor-smashing incident. In the video, FedEx Senior Vice President of Operations Matthew Thornton stated that he had personally met with the aggrieved customer, who had accepted the company’s apology. “This goes directly against all FedEx values,” declared Thornton. The FedEx video struck a responsive chord. Numerous journalists and bloggers responded with stories about FedEx’s outstanding package handling and delivering record.

Many companies have now created teams of specialists that monitor online conversations and engage unhappy consumers. For example, the social care team at Southwest Airlines includes a chief Twitter officer who tracks Twitter comments and monitors Facebook groups, an online representative who checks facts and interacts with bloggers, and another person who takes charge of the company’s presence on sites such as YouTube, Instagram, Flickr, and LinkedIn. So if someone posts an online comment, the company can respond promptly in a personal way.

Not long ago, Southwest’s team averted what could have been a major PR catastrophe when a hole popped open in a plane’s fuselage on a flight from Phoenix to Sacramento. The flight had Wi-Fi, and the first passenger tweet about the incident, complete with a photo, was online in only nine minutes—11 minutes before Southwest’s official dispatch channel report. But Southwest’s monitoring team picked up the social media chatter and was able to craft a blog post and other social media responses shortly after the plane made an emergency landing in Yuma, Arizona. By the time the story hit the major media, the passenger who had tweeted initially was back on Twitter praising the Southwest crew for its professional handling of the situation.

Thus, by monitoring and proactively responding to seemingly uncontrollable events in the environment, companies can prevent the negatives from spiraling out of control or even turn them into positives. Who knows? With the right responses, Walmartblows.com might even become Walmartrules.com. Then again, probably not.
