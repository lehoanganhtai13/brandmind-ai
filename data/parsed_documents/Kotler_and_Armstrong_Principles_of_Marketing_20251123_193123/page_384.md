And UPS not only delivers packages for online shoe and accessories marketer Zappos, it also manages Zappos’s important and complex order returns process in an efficient, customer-pleasing way.27  
3PL providers like UPS can help clients tighten up sluggish, overstuffed supply chains; slash inventories; and get products to customers more quickly and reliably. According to one report, 86 percent of *Fortune* 500 companies use 3PL (also called *outsourced logistics* or *contract logistics*) services. General Motors, P&G, and Walmart each use 50 or more 3PLs.28  
Companies use third-party logistics providers for several reasons. First, because getting the product to market is their main focus, using these providers makes the most sense, as they can often do it more efficiently and at lower cost. Outsourcing logistics typically results in a 10 to 25 percent cost savings.29 Second, outsourcing logistics frees a company to focus more intensely on its core business. Finally, integrated logistics companies understand increasingly complex logistics environments.

# 12 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review  
Some companies pay too little attention to their distribution channels; others, however, have used imaginative distribution systems to gain a competitive advantage. A company’s channel decisions directly affect every other marketing decision. Management must make channel decisions carefully, incorporating today’s needs with tomorrow’s likely selling environment.

**OBJECTIVE 12-1** Explain why companies use marketing channels and discuss the functions these channels perform. *(pp 358–361)*  
In creating customer engagement and value, a company can’t go it alone. It must work within an entire network of partners—a value delivery network—to accomplish this task. Individual companies and brands don’t compete; their entire value delivery networks do.  
Most producers use intermediaries to bring their products to market. They forge a *marketing channel* (or *distribution channel*)—a set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption by the consumer or business user. Through their contacts, experience, specialization, and scale of operation, intermediaries usually offer the firm more than it can achieve on its own.  
Marketing channels perform many key functions. Some help *complete transactions* by gathering and distributing *information* needed for planning and aiding exchange, developing and spreading persuasive *communications* about an offer, performing *contact work* (finding and communicating with prospective buyers), *matching* (shaping and fitting the offer to the buyer’s needs), and entering into *negotiation* to reach an agreement on price and other terms of the offer so that ownership can be transferred. Other functions help to *fulfill* the completed transactions by offering *physical distribution* (transporting and storing goods), *financing* (acquiring and using funds to cover the costs of the channel work), and *risk taking* (assuming the risks of carrying out the channel work).

**OBJECTIVE 12-2** Discuss how channel members interact and how they organize to perform the work of the channel. *(pp 362–368)*  
The channel will be most effective when each member assumes the tasks it can do best. Ideally, because the success of individual channel members depends on overall channel success, all channel firms should work together smoothly. They should understand and accept their roles, coordinate their goals and activities, and cooperate to attain overall channel goals. By cooperating, they can more effectively sense, serve, and satisfy the target market.  
In a large company, the formal organization structure assigns roles and provides needed leadership. But in a distribution channel composed of independent firms, leadership and power are not formally set. Traditionally, distribution channels have lacked the leadership needed to assign roles and manage conflict.  
In recent years, however, new types of channel organizations have appeared that provide stronger leadership and improved performance.

**OBJECTIVE 12-3** Identify the major channel alternatives open to a company. *(pp 368–372)*  
Channel alternatives vary from direct selling to using one, two, three, or more intermediary *channel levels*. Marketing channels face continuous and sometimes dramatic change. Three of the most important trends are the growth of *vertical, horizontal,* and *multichannel marketing systems*.
