She purchases a chair for $125 and sells it for $275. Determine the following:  
a. dollar markup  
b. markup percentage on cost  
c. markup percentage on selling price  

# 1.3  
A consumer purchases a coffee maker from a retailer for $90. The retailer’s markup is 30%, and the wholesaler’s markup is 10%, both based on selling price. For what price does the manufacturer sell the product to the wholesaler?  

# 1.4  
A lawn mower manufacturer has a unit cost of $140 and wishes to achieve a margin of 30% based on selling price. If the manufacturer sells directly to a retailer who then adds a set margin of 40% based on selling price, determine the retail price charged to consumers.  

# 1.5  
Advanced Electronics manufactures DVDs and sells them directly to retailers who typically sell them for $20. Retailers take a 40% margin based on the retail selling price. Advanced’s cost information is as follows:

This data outlines the cost structure associated with DVD production and distribution, presenting a breakdown of expenses per unit and fixed costs. Variable costs include the DVD package and disc at $2.50 per unit and royalties at $2.25 per unit. Fixed costs, incurred regardless of the number of DVDs produced, consist of advertising and promotion totaling $500,000 and overhead expenses amounting to $200,000. This structure highlights a cost model where per-unit expenses are supplemented by significant upfront investments in marketing and operational infrastructure.

Calculate the following:  
a. contribution per unit and contribution margin  
b. break-even volume in DVD units and dollars  
c. volume in DVD units and dollar sales necessary if Advanced’s profit goal is 20% profit on sales  
d. net profit if 5 million DVDs are sold  

# Demand Estimates, the Marketing Budget, and Marketing Performance Measures

## Market Potential and Sales Estimates  
HD has now calculated the sales needed to break even and to attain various profit goals on its new product. However, the company needs more information regarding demand in order to assess the feasibility of attaining the needed sales levels. This information is also needed for production and other decisions. For example, production schedules need to be developed and marketing tactics need to be planned.

> **Total market demand**  
> The total volume that would be bought by a defined consumer group in a defined geographic area in a defined time period in a defined marketing environment under a defined level and mix of industry marketing effort.

The **total market demand** for a product or service is the total volume that would be bought by a defined consumer group in a defined geographic area in a defined time period in a defined marketing environment under a defined level and mix of industry marketing effort. Total market demand is not a fixed number but a function of the stated conditions. For example, next year’s total market demand for this type of product will depend on how much other producers spend on marketing their brands. It also depends on many environmental factors, such as government regulations, economic conditions, and the level of consumer confidence in a given market. The upper limit of market demand is called **market potential**.

> **Market potential**  
> The upper limit of market demand.

One general but practical method that HD might use for estimating total market demand uses three variables: (1) the number of prospective buyers, (2) the quantity purchased by an average buyer per year, and (3) the price of an average unit. Using these numbers, HD can estimate total market demand as follows:

$$
Q = n \times q \times p
$$

where  
- \(Q\) = total market demand  
- \(n\) = number of buyers in the market  
- \(q\) = quantity purchased by an average buyer per year  
- \(p\) = price of an average unit Estimating market demand by multiplying a base number by a chain of adjusting percentages.
