These events usually generate thousands of social mentions and blogs, which produce awareness about and preference for these new devices. One example is Samsung’s launch of the Galaxy Note 5 in New York in 2015. For this occasion, Samsung handpicked four key creators in Asia and Australia and flew them to New York. They sent Australia’s fashion blogger Nadia Fairfax; Malaysia’s actor and director Joseph Germani; the Philippines’ dancer, producer, and director Gabriel Valenciano; and Taiwanese producer and entertainer How How to be among the first to get their hands on the Galaxy Note 5 and explore the phablet. The result was a video shot in a marathon 24-hour period, and the resulting “Moment of Note” film showed how the content creators were able to take full advantage of the new phone in their creative pursuits. Samsung ingeniously associated the phone with experiences rather than presenting customers with a list of new specifications.

Additionally, the “Samsung Mobilers program” is used by the company as another tool to enhance brand awareness and engage customers. Samsung Mobilers is an ambassadors’ program where active Samsung mobile loyalists are provided with Samsung devices ahead of market release so they can freely talk about their user experience and provide their feedback and insights on the assigned devices using their own social media accounts. Mobilers are often offered the opportunity to participate in marketing events across the world, such as the IFA conference in Berlin, which is the world’s leading trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances. As a result, Samsung managed to account for 26.7 percent of the share of voice during IFA2014. Products from Samsung such as the Galaxy Note 5, Gear VR, and the Galaxy Note Edge secured Samsung’s first place and were very well received among media and the larger public.

The Smartphone app is also fueling Samsung’s success in the digital marketing arena, bringing customers support on the go with seamless navigation for online support and service tracking information for products. Customers can find FAQs, videos, and easy-to-follow self-diagnosis guides. The app is designed to keep customers connected with Samsung.

Samsung’s video homepage on YouTube provides another platform to engage customers. It gives them easy and tailored access to all videos for every Samsung product and marketing campaign, which helps the electronics giant showcase its range of phones and tablets, demonstrating that it can cater to all tastes in an attractive way. Overall, Samsung’s use of video is engaging, comprehensive, and easily accessible. In 2013, Samsung won Unruly’s “Social Brand of the Year” with 7.3 million shares. In 2014, the company came in second place with 4.3 million shares gained by several videos, mainly coinciding with the FIFA World Cup, including “#Galaxy11: The Training” (538,262 shares).

Of course, Samsung also utilizes its websites to connect with their customers. Customers can use the company

website not only for product information but also to engage with Samsung by accessing several online services, including live chats, how-to videos, help and troubleshooting, product warranty information, and service repair status updates.

Finally, Samsung makes use of web and mobile email as an effective tool for building long-term, one-to-one relationships with carefully targeted customers. Samsung successfully tailors emails—their design, messages, and offers—to the characteristics and needs of specific customers. Through its huge database, Samsung can send tailored messages to customers who just purchased a Samsung device or to people who are likely to purchase a Samsung device in the near future.

In all, Samsung Electronics has successfully used new digital tools and approaches to enhance customer relationships and build a competitive edge. In 2015, according to a recent report from the Reputation Institute, an advisory firm, Samsung was reported the tech industry’s most reputable company. Apple, the most valuable company by market capitalization and Samsung’s biggest competitor, ranked 21st among its 48 tech brethren. Samsung Electronics has become a poster child for direct and digital marketing and continues to engage customers and create direct, personalized customer relationships.
