This chapter outline details key learning objectives related to distribution channels and marketing. It begins with Objective 13-1, focusing on the fundamental role of retailers within the distribution channel and categorizing major retailer types, referencing pages 392-399.

### Retailing

**Retailing** includes all the activities involved in selling products or services directly to final consumers for their personal, nonbusiness use. Many institutions—manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers—do retailing. But most retailing is done by **retailers**, businesses whose sales come *primarily* from retailing. Retailing plays a very important role in most marketing channels. Last year, retailers accounted for more than $5.3 trillion of sales to final consumers.

**Retailing: Connecting Brands with Consumers**  
Retailers connect brands with consumers in the final phases of the buying process and at the point of purchase. In fact, many marketers are now embracing the concept of **shopper marketing**, focusing the entire marketing process—from product and brand development to logistics, promotion, and merchandising—toward turning shoppers into buyers as they approach the point of sale. Of course, every well-designed marketing effort focuses on customer buying behavior. What differentiates the concept of shopper marketing is the suggestion that these efforts should be coordinated around the shopping process itself.

Shopper marketing builds around what P&G calls the “First Moment of Truth”—the critical three to seven seconds that a shopper considers a product on a store shelf.

Instead, Google defines a “zero moment of truth,” when consumers begin the buying process by searching for and learning about products online.

Today’s consumers are increasingly *omni-channel buyers*, who make little distinction between in-store and online shopping and for whom the path to a retail purchase runs across multiple channels. For these buyers, a particular purchase might consist of researching a product online and buying it from an online retailer without ever setting foot in a retail store. Alternatively, they might use a smartphone to research a purchase on the fly or even while in retail store aisles. For example, it’s common to see a consumer examining an item on a shelf at Target while at the same time using a mobile app to look for coupons or check product reviews and prices at Amazon.com.

Thus, these days, shopper marketing and the “point of purchase” go well beyond in-store buying. They involve consumers working across multiple channels as they
