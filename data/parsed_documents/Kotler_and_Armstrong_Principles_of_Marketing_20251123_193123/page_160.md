# Chapter 5 | Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

## Figure 5.1  
### The Model of Buyer Behavior

This diagram illustrates a model of buyer behavior, depicting a process with three main stages: the environment, the buyer's black box, and buyer responses. The environment encompasses both marketing stimuli, specifically product, price, place, and promotion, and other external factors such as economic, technological, social, and cultural influences. These environmental elements feed into the buyer's black box, which contains the buyer's characteristics and their decision process. The output of this black box is the buyer's responses, manifesting as buying attitudes and preferences, purchase behavior (including what, when, where, and how much is bought), and ultimately, brand engagements and relationships. The structure suggests a cause-and-effect relationship, where environmental inputs are processed internally by the buyer, leading to observable behavioral outputs.

> We can measure the whats, wheres, and whens of buyer behavior. But it’s difficult to “see” inside the consumer’s head and figure out the whys (that’s why it’s called the black box).

We look first at buyer characteristics as they affect buyer behavior and then discuss the buyer decision process.

> **Author Comment:** Many levels of factors affect our buying behavior—from broad cultural and social influences to motivations, beliefs, and attitudes lying deep within us.

# Characteristics Affecting Consumer Behavior

Consumer purchases are influenced strongly by cultural, social, personal, and psychological characteristics, as shown in **Figure 5.2**. For the most part, marketers cannot control such factors, but they must take them into account.

## Cultural Factors

Cultural factors exert a broad and deep influence on consumer behavior. Marketers need to understand the role played by the buyer’s *culture*, *subculture*, and *social class*.

### Culture

**Culture** is the most basic cause of a person’s wants and behavior. Human behavior is largely learned. Growing up in a society, a child learns basic values, perceptions, wants, and behaviors from his or her family and other important institutions. A child in the United States normally is exposed to the following values: achievement and success, freedom, individualism, hard work, activity and involvement, efficiency and practicality, material comfort, youthfulness, and fitness and health. Every group or society has a culture, and cultural influences on buying behavior may vary greatly from both county to county and country to country.

Marketers are always trying to spot *cultural shifts* so as to discover new products that might be wanted. For example, the cultural shift toward greater concern about health and fitness has created a huge industry for health-and-fitness services, exercise equipment and clothing, organic foods, and a variety of diets.

## Figure 5.2  
### Factors Influencing Consumer Behavior

This table outlines four key categories of factors influencing consumer behavior: Cultural, Social, Personal, and Psychological. The Cultural category encompasses broad societal influences like Culture, Subculture, and Social class. Social influences are more immediate, including Groups and social networks, Family, and Roles and status. Personal factors are individual-specific, such as Age and life-cycle stage, Occupation, Economic situation, Lifestyle, and Personality and self-concept. Finally, Psychological factors represent internal cognitive and emotional processes, comprising Motivation, Perception, Learning, and Beliefs and attitudes. These categories collectively represent a hierarchical structure of influences, moving from the broadest societal context to the most internal individual processes that shape consumer decision-making.

> Many brands now target specific subcultures—such as Hispanic American, African American, and Asian American consumers—with marketing programs tailored to their specific needs and preferences.

> People’s buying decisions reflect and contribute to their lifestyles—their whole pattern of acting and interacting in the world. For example, KitchenAid sells much more than just kitchen appliances. It sells an entire cooking and entertainment lifestyle to “Kitchenthusiasts.”

> Our buying decisions are affected by an incredibly complex combination of external and internal influences.
