Toward the end of the print advert it made an indirect reference to Apple’s previous brand positioning before stating that it would pick up where the leader left off.

The campaign also included a two-minute YouTube video that showed a focus group of iPhone users being asked to describe their feelings about the iPhone 7’s new features. The participants gave mild responses, remarking that there was not much difference from previous versions of the iPhone. The participants were then introduced to new iPhone “prototypes” with modular and interchangeable back cases that can function as a power pack, external speakers, camera, and projector. The participants were excited about these new features, and one commented that they made them feel like Apple had heard what the consumers were saying. It was then disclosed to the participants that prototype phone was actually the Moto Z with the Moto Mod features. Lenovo claimed that the attendees of the focus group were not actors.

Lenovo thus set out to communicate its stand against incrementalism and challenged the marginal changes that smartphone users had become accustomed to. It presented its Moto Mod features as truly revolutionary and a contrast to the offerings of the two major brands, encouraging the audience to re evaluate what real innovation is. The approach was openly comparative as it challenged people’s devotion to Apple and Samsung. The comparative and aggressive strategy has worked well for Samsung in the past when it challenged Apple’s market leadership. It will be interesting to see how Lenovo will build on and communicate its proclaimed “revolutionary” brand differences in its own challenge to the big guns of the smartphone industry.

Advertising’s goal is to help move consumers through the buying process. Some advertising is designed to move people to immediate action. For example, a direct-response television ad by Weight Watchers urges consumers to go online and sign up right away, and a Best Buy newspaper insert for a weekend sale encourages immediate store visits. However, many ads focus on building or strengthening long-term customer relationships. For example, a Nike television ad in which well-known athletes work through extreme challenges in their Nike gear never directly asks for a sale. Instead, the goal is to engage customers and somehow change the way they think or feel about the brand.

## Setting the Advertising Budget

After determining its advertising objectives, the company next sets its **advertising budget** for each product. Four commonly used methods for setting promotion budgets are discussed in Chapter 14. Here we discuss some specific factors that should be considered when setting the advertising budget.

A brand’s advertising budget often depends on its stage in the product life cycle. For example, new products typically need relatively large advertising budgets to build awareness and to gain consumer trial. In contrast, mature brands usually require lower budgets as a ratio to sales. Also, brands in a market with many competitors and high advertising clutter must be advertised more heavily to be noticed above the noise in the marketplace.
