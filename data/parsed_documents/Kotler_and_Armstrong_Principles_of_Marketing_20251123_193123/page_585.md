# 19.2 7-Eleven: Making Life a Little Easier for People around the Globe

Americans love convenience stores. There’s one just around the corner, and they’re open long hours, seven days a week. Whether it’s big chains like 7-Eleven and Circle K or more-local favorites like Illinois-based Moto-Mart, Nebraska’s Bucky’s, or Minnesota’s own Pump ‘N Munch, convenience stores have become an American mainstay for buying snacks, gas, or a few fill-in items between major grocery store trips. It’s hard to imagine a convenience store being anything else.

But as it turns out, the convenience store concept doesn’t translate in a standard way across international borders. Just ask 7-Eleven, a chain that’s sweeping the planet. 7-Eleven is America’s largest convenience store chain, with more than 10,000 U.S. stores in 34 states. But it’s also the world’s biggest convenience chain, with more than 56,000 stores in 16 countries generating nearly $85 billion in annual worldwide sales. 7-Eleven’s global success results from carefully adapting its overall convenience format to unique market-by-market needs.

7-Eleven began in 1927 when “Uncle Johnny” Jefferson Green started selling milk, bread, and eggs from the dock of the Southland Ice Company where he worked, often on Sundays and evenings when regular grocery stores were closed. Within 10 years, Southland Ice Company had opened 60 such outlets selling basic staples—everything from canned goods to cold watermelon. As the chain grew, the convenience store concept took root—small stores in convenient locations, a limited line of high-demand products, speedy transactions, and friendly service.

In 1946, the fast-growing chain boldly established longer store hours—you guessed it, 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.—a practice unheard of at the time. And to cement its convenience positioning, it changed its name to 7-Eleven. To support its breakneck expansion, 7-Eleven also adopted a franchise model by which franchisees shared some of the financial and operational burdens of growth. In return, 7-Eleven granted franchisees lots of flexibility in catering to local tastes in their stores. The company calls this “retailer initiative” and considers it a key competitive advantage. Catering to local tastes would later become the cornerstone of 7-Eleven’s international expansion.

In 1969, 7-Eleven became the first convenience chain to go global, first in Canada, then Mexico, and soon Japan and other Asian markets. In each global market, the chain has retained its key strategy elements—the small-store format, convenience positioning, and global brand identity—you’ll see the familiar 7-Eleven logo and orange, red, white, and green stripes on every 7-Eleven store anywhere in the world. At first glance, a 7-Eleven in Tokyo looks pretty like one in Teaneck, New Jersey. But true to its “retailer initiative” philosophy, 7-Eleven skillfully adapts its operations in each global market to match widely differing local definitions of just what “convenience” means.

Consider Japan, one of 7-Eleven’s first international ventures. 7-Elevens are everywhere in Japan, more than 17,000 of them—2,300 in Tokyo alone. Japan is now by far the company’s largest market. Once you get past the familiar signage on the outside of a Japanese 7-Eleven, you’ll find some pretty stark contrasts on the inside. More than just a place to grab a loaf of bread or a Slurpee, Big Gulp, or Big Bite, 7-Eleven in Japan has become the country’s most popular eatery.

Around mealtime, the aisles at every Japanese 7-Eleven are packed with long lines of patrons who are treated to some of the finest prepared foods in the world. Typical offerings include salmon on rice with butter and soy sauce, hashed beef doria in a red wine demi-glace, and ground chicken with ginger and a side of spinach coleslaw. Fresh sushi abounds, and the ongiri (rice balls with seaweed) is wrapped in a way that keeps the seaweed crispy and the rice moist. 7-Eleven in Japan also offers a wide selection of beverages, including soft drinks, beer, sake, Champagne, single-malt scotch, wine, and more than 20 varieties of iced coffee.

This is not your typical American 7-Eleven. Stores receive several food deliveries each day, keeping shelves well stocked with fresh goods and ensuring that everything is locally made. Food is served in open display cases in a manner that’s more Trader Joe’s than convenience store. Japanese customers can even order food and groceries online and have them delivered at work or home. The chain also meets other customer service needs. At 7-Eleven, customers can pay their phone or utility bills, pick up their mail and parcel deliveries, and even buy baseball tickets from the copy machine.

For 7-Eleven, Japan now represents far more than just a booming international market. Since the early 1990s, Japan has become 7-Eleven’s home market. When Dallas-based 7-Eleven encountered financial difficulties in 1991, its own highly successful
