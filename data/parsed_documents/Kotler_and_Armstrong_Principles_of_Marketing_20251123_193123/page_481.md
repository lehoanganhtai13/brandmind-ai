# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This table outlines four key objectives related to personal selling and sales force management. Objective 16-1 focuses on the fundamental role of salespeople in customer value creation and relationship building, referencing the concept of Personal Selling. Objective 16-2 delves into the six essential steps involved in managing a sales force. Objective 16-3 examines the stages of the personal selling process, differentiating between transaction-oriented and relationship marketing approaches. Finally, Objective 16-4 addresses the development and implementation of sales promotion campaigns. The structure is hierarchical, moving from the foundational role of salespeople to the management and process of selling, and concluding with sales promotion strategies.

## IN THIS CHAPTER

We examine two more promotion mix tools: *personal selling* and *sales promotion*. Personal selling consists of interpersonal interactions with customers and prospects to make sales and maintain customer relationships. Sales promotion involves using short-term incentives to encourage customer purchasing, reseller support, and sales force efforts.

> Personal selling is the interpersonal arm of the promotion mix. A company’s sales force creates and communicates customer value by personally engaging customers and building customer relationships.

## Personal Selling

Robert Louis Stevenson once noted, “Everyone lives by selling something.” Companies around the world use sales forces to sell products and services to business customers and final consumers. But sales forces are also found in many other kinds of organizations. For example, colleges use recruiters to attract new students. Museums and fine arts organizations use fundraisers to contact donors and raise money. Even governments use sales forces. The U.S. Postal Service, for instance, uses a sales force to sell Express Mail and other shipping and mailing solutions to corporate customers. In the first part of this chapter, we examine personal selling’s role in the organization, sales force management decisions, and the personal selling process.

### The Nature of Personal Selling

**Personal selling** is one of the oldest professions in the world. The people who do the selling go by many names, including salespeople, sales representatives, agents, district managers, account executives, sales consultants, and sales engineers.

People hold many stereotypes of salespeople—including some unfavorable ones. *Salesman* may bring to mind the image of Dwight Schrute, the opinionated Dunder Mifflin paper salesman from the old TV show *The Office*, who lacks both common sense and social skills. Or you may think of the real-life “yell-and-sell” TV pitchmen, who hawk everything from the Flex Seal to the FOCUS T25 Workout and the Ove Glove in infomercials. However, the majority of salespeople are a far cry from these unfortunate stereotypes.

As the opening Salesforce story shows, most salespeople are well-educated and well-trained professionals who add value for customers and maintain long-term customer relationships. They listen to their customers, assess customer needs, and organize the company’s efforts to solve customer problems. The best salespeople are the ones who work
