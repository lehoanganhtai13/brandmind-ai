# 20 Sustainable Marketing  
## Social Responsibility and Ethics

In this final chapter, we’ll examine the concept of sustainable marketing, meeting the needs of consumers, businesses, and society—now and in the future—through socially and environmentally responsible marketing actions. We’ll start by defining sustainable marketing and then look at some common criticisms of marketing as it affects individual consumers as well as public actions that promote sustainable marketing. Finally, we’ll see how companies themselves can benefit from proactively pursuing sustainable marketing practices that bring value to not only individual customers but also society as a whole. Sustainable marketing actions are more than just the right thing to do; they’re also good for business.

First, let’s look at an example of sustainable marketing in action at Unilever, the world’s third-largest consumer products company. For 17 years running, Unilever has been named sustainability leader in the food and beverage industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The company recently launched its Sustainable Living Plan, by which it intends to double its size by 2020 while at the same time reducing its impact on the planet and increasing the social benefits arising from its activities. That’s an ambitious goal.

## SUSTAINABILITY AT UNILEVER: Creating a Better Future Every Day

When Paul Polman took over as CEO of Unilever a half-dozen years ago, the foods, home, and personal care products company was a slumbering giant. Despite its stable of star-studded brands—including the likes of Dove, Axe, Noxzema, Sunsilk, OMO, Hellmann’s, Knorr, Lipton, and Ben & Jerry’s—Unilever had experienced a decade of stagnant sales and profits. The company needed renewed energy and purpose. “To drag the world back to sanity, we need to know why we are here,” said Polman.

To answer the “why are we here” question and find a more energizing mission, Polman looked beyond the usual corporate goals of growing sales, profits, and shareholder value. Instead, he asserted, growth results from accomplishing a broader social and environmental mission. Unilever exists “for consumers, not shareholders,” he said. “If we are in sync with consumer needs and the environment in which we operate, and take responsibility for our [societal impact], then the shareholder will also be rewarded.”

Evaluating and working on sustainability impact is nothing new at Unilever. Prior to Polman taking the reins, the company already had multiple programs in place to manage the impact of its products and operations. But the existing programs and results—while good—simply didn’t go far enough for Polman. So in late 2010 Unilever launched its Sustainable Living Plan—an aggressive long-term plan that takes capitalism to the next level. Under the plan, the company set out to “create a better future every day for people around the world: the people who work for us, those we do business with, the billions of people who use our products, and future generations whose quality of life depends on the way we protect the environment today.” According to Polman, Unilever’s long-run commercial success depends on how well it manages the social and environmental impact of its actions.

The Sustainable Living Plan sets out three major social and environmental objectives to be accomplished by 2020:  
* (1) To help more than one billion people take action to improve their health and well-being;  
* (2) To halve the environmental footprint of the making and use of our products; and  
* (3) To enhance the livelihoods of millions of people as we grow our business.

The Sustainable Living Plan pulls together all of the work Unilever had already been doing and sets ambitious new sustainability goals.
