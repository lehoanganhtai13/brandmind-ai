FIFTH THIRD BANK  
FASTER THAN A HAMSTER CAN EAT FIVE CHEESE BALLS?

Campaign targets younger consumers who are increasingly put off by the traditional banking world. The “No Waiting” campaign includes TV spots but also a full slate of digital video and social media content, even a novel mobile game, aimed at engaging impatient, social-media-savvy millennials. The anything-but-stodgy digital videos provide humorous side-by-side comparisons showing that a check can be deposited using the Fifth Third Bank app faster than a hamster can eat five cheese balls or faster than an accordion player can play “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” The campaign also features an animated mobile game, “TXTvsTXT,” that tests a user’s texting speed. Something you wouldn’t expect from a bank, the mobile game offers a quirky way for text-savvy millennials to test their finger-clicking skills, challenge friends on Facebook, and earn badges ranging from “molasses hands” to “turbo twiddler.” Millennials “want it fast, whether in a text conversation or checking your balance on the Fifth Third Bank mobile app,” says Fifth Third’s chief marketer. “Our mobile banking takes the wait out of banking and we believe [this campaign] tells that story in a fun engaging way.”

Hard on the heels of the millennials is **Generation Z**, young people born after 2000 (although many analysts include people born after 1995 in this group). The approximately 82 million Gen Zers make up the important kids, tweens, and teens markets. They spend an estimated $44 billion annually of their own money and influence up to $600 billion of family spending. These young consumers also represent tomorrow’s markets—they are now forming brand relationships that will affect their buying well into the future.

Even more than the millennials, the defining characteristic of Gen Zers is their utter fluency and comfort with digital technologies. Generation Z takes smartphones, tablets, internet-connected game consoles, wireless internet, and digital and social media for granted—they’ve always had them—making this group highly mobile, connected, and social. On average, connected Gen Zers receive more than 3,000 texts per month. “If they’re awake, they’re online,” quips one analyst. They have “digital in their DNA,” says another.

Gen Zers blend the online and offline worlds seamlessly as they socialize and shop. According to recent studies, despite their youth, more than half of all Generation Z tweens and teens do product research before buying a product or having their parents buy it for them. Of those who shop online, more than half *prefer* shopping online in categories ranging from electronics, books, music, sports equipment, and beauty products to clothes, shoes, and fashion accessories.

Companies in almost all industries market products and services aimed at Generation Z. For example, many retailers have created special lines or even entire stores appealing to Gen Z buyers and their parents—consider Abercrombie Kids, Gap Kids, Old Navy Kids, and Pottery Barn Kids. The Justice chain targets only tween girls, with apparel and accessories laser-focused on their special preferences and lifestyles. Although these young buyers often have their mothers in tow, “the *last* thing a 10- or 12-year-old girl wants is to look like her mom,” says Justice’s CEO. Justice’s stores, website, and social media pages are designed with tweens in mind. “You have to appeal to their senses,” says the CEO. “They love sensory overload—bright colors, music videos, a variety of merchandise, the tumult of all of that.”

Marketing to Gen Zers and their parents presents special challenges. Traditional media are still important to this group. Magazines such as *J-14* and *Twist* are popular with some Gen Z segments, as are TV channels such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. But marketers know they must meet Gen Zers where they hang out and shop. Increasingly, that’s in the online and mobile worlds. Although the under-13 set remains barred from social media such as Periscope, Snapchat, and Instagram, at least officially, social media will play a crucial marketing role as the kids and tweens grow into their teens and early twenties.

Today’s kids are notoriously fickle and hard to pin down. The key is to engage these young consumers and let them help to define their brand experiences. For example, to engage young consumers more deeply, The North Face even invites them to help design its outdoor apparel and gear.
