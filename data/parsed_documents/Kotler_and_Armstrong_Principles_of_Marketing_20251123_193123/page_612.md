# Sustainable Marketing: Social Responsibility and Ethics

Since opening its first franchise in 2008, the company has grown considerably, and it now has more than 60 locations in the United States, the Middle East, and Mexico. The international side of the business is thriving, particularly due to the growth of franchises in the Middle East; the company has opened more than 23 outlets in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In September 2016, the company signed an agreement to open 20 restaurants in Egypt.

Affluent consumers in the Middle East are not very price-sensitive and are happy to pay a higher price for something that they perceive to be different from the various burger options available. Young Middle Eastern consumers in particular are much more aware of global trends like organic food and sustainable consumption, and they want to identify with these issues. The organic eating concept is quite in vogue for these consumers and this has spurred the launch of many an organic restaurant, especially in the United Arab Emirates. Elevation Burger’s biggest regional outlet is on Jumeirah Beach Road, one of the prime coastal neighborhoods of Dubai, which is home to some of the highest revenue-earning outlets of international franchises and a competitive place with regard to its entertainment, retail, and hospitality sectors. The Elevation Burger outlet in Dubai maintains the same principle of using mostly renewable and non-polluting materials, and its venue has breathtaking views of the sea and some of the iconic Dubai sites, making it a complete family destination.

Elevation Burger empowers its patrons to make smarter burger choices and personalize them with a wide range of toppings, from gluten-free and paleo-friendly to veggie burgers and multiple beef patties. In a market where eating out signifies prime socializing time, a fast-food restaurant with a sustainable and ethical proposition that allows the consumer to align their cultural and traditional values with modern and trendy choices definitely has a unique appeal.

The success of Elevation Burger demonstrates that consumers around the world want brands that are socially responsible and whose philosophy is reflected in its products and practices. The company’s strong ethical proposition has helped it win loyal customers in the markets it has served, and with its 100 percent organic burger concept and the growing consumer interest in health and sustainability, Elevation Burger has developed a meaningful differentiation that will help it to achieve even higher levels of success.

It takes in, sending less than 1 percent to landfills and incineration facilities. What started out as an environmental effort has now grown into a multibillion-dollar IBM business that profitably recycles electronic equipment at 22 sites worldwide.  

Today’s *greening* activities focus on improving what companies already do to protect the environment. The *beyond greening* activities identified in Figure 20.2 look to the future. First, internally, companies can plan for *new clean technology*. Many organizations that have made good sustainability headway are still limited by existing technologies. To create fully sustainable strategies, they will need to develop innovative new technologies.

For example, by 2020, Coca-Cola has committed to reclaiming and recycling the equivalent of all the packaging it uses around the world. It has also pledged to dramatically reduce its overall environmental footprint. To accomplish these goals, the company invests heavily in new clean technologies that address a host of environmental issues, such as recycling, resource usage, and distribution:

> First, to attack the solid waste problem caused by its plastic bottles, Coca-Cola invested heavily to build the world’s largest state-of-the-art plastic-bottle-to-bottle recycling plant. As a more permanent solution, Coke is researching and testing new bottles made from aluminum, corn, or bioplastics. It has been steadily replacing its PET plastic bottles with PlantBottle packaging, which incorporates 30 percent plant-based materials. The company is also designing more eco-friendly distribution alternatives. Currently, some 10 million vending machines and refrigerated coolers gobble up energy and use potent greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to keep Cokes cold. To eliminate them, the company has been installing sleek new HFC-free coolers that use 30 to 40 percent less energy—so far more than 1.4 million have been installed. Coca-Cola has even developed a line of “eKOCool” solar-powered coolers that not only conserve energy resources but are also functional in rural areas of emerging economies such as India, where conventional power sources are often unreliable. And Coca-Cola is now almost 100 percent “water neutral,” adding back to communities and nature the equivalent of all the fresh water that its bottlers use in the production of Coca-Cola beverages.

Finally, companies can develop a *sustainability vision*, which serves as a guide to the future. It shows how the company’s products and services, processes, and policies must evolve and what new technologies must be developed to get there.
