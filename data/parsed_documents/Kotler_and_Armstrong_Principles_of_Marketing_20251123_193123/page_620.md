# Sustainable Marketing: Social Responsibility and Ethics

“I don’t regret the decision,” says SC Johnson’s CEO. “Despite the cost, it was the right thing to do, and . . . I sleep better at night because of it. We gained a surer sense of who we are as a company and what we want SC Johnson to represent.”

As with environmentalism, the issue of ethics presents special challenges for international marketers. Business standards and practices vary a great deal from one country to the next. For example, bribes and kickbacks are illegal for U.S. firms, and various treaties against bribery and corruption have been signed and ratified by more than 60 countries. Yet these are still standard business practices in many countries. The World Bank estimates that bribes totaling more than $1 trillion per year are paid out worldwide. One study showed that the most flagrant bribe-paying firms were from Indonesia, Mexico, China, and Russia. Other countries where corruption is common include Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Yemen. The least corrupt were companies from Australia, Denmark, Finland, and Japan. The question arises as to whether a company must lower its ethical standards to compete effectively in countries with lower standards. The answer is no. Companies should make a commitment to a common set of shared standards worldwide.

Many industrial and professional associations have suggested codes of ethics, and many companies are now adopting their own codes. For example, the American Marketing Association, an international association of marketing managers and scholars, developed a code of ethics that calls on marketers to adopt the following ethical norms:

* *Do no harm.* This means consciously avoiding harmful actions or omissions by embodying high ethical standards and adhering to all applicable laws and regulations in the choices we make.
* *Foster trust in the marketing system.* This means striving for good faith and fair dealing so as to contribute toward the efficacy of the exchange process as well as avoiding deception in product design, pricing, communication, and delivery or distribution.
* *Embrace ethical values.* This means building relationships and enhancing consumer confidence in the integrity of marketing by affirming these core values: honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, transparency, and citizenship.

Companies are also developing programs to teach managers about important ethical issues and help them find the proper responses. They hold ethics workshops and seminars and create ethics committees. Furthermore, most major U.S. companies have appointed high-level ethics officers to champion ethical issues and help resolve ethics problems and concerns facing employees. And most companies have established their own codes of ethical conduct.

Don’t be evil  
Do the right thing

**Marketing ethics: Google’s Code of Conduct is the mechanism by which the company puts its well-known “Don’t be evil—do the right thing” motto into practice.**

Google is a good example. Its official Google Code of Conduct is the mechanism by which the company puts its well-known “Don’t be evil” motto into practice. The detailed code’s core message is simple: Google employees (known inside as “Googlers”) must earn users’ faith and trust by holding themselves to the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. The Google Code of Conduct is “about providing our users unbiased access to information, focusing on their needs, and giving them the best products and services that we can. But it’s also about doing the right thing more generally—following the law, acting honorably, and treating each other with respect.”

Google requires all Googlers—from board members to the newest employee—to take personal responsibility for practicing both the spirit and letter of the code and encouraging other Googlers to do the same. It urges employees to report violations to their managers, to human resources representatives, or using an Ethics & Compliance hotline. “If you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment, don’t be silent,” states the code.
