For example, Kohl’s gets exclusive rights to carry well-known labels such as Simply Vera by Vera Wang and a Food Network-branded line of kitchen tools, utensils, and appliances. Kohl’s also offers its own private-label lines, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow, Candies, and Apt. 9.

The *services mix* can also help set one retailer apart from another. For example, some retailers invite customers to ask questions or consult service representatives in person or via phone or tablet. Home Depot offers a diverse mix of services to do-it-yourselfers, from “how-to” classes and “do-it-herself” and kid workshops to a proprietary credit card. Nordstrom delivers top-notch service and promises to “take care of the customer, no matter what it takes.”

The *store’s atmosphere* is another important element in the reseller’s product arsenal. Retailers want to create a unique store experience, one that suits the target market and moves customers to buy. Many retailers practice *experiential retailing*. For example, L.L.Bean has turned its flagship Freeport store and campus into a full-fledged outdoor adventure center, where customers can hike, bike, golf, kayak, or even go seal watching or fishing at nearby Cisco Bay. Along with selling outdoor apparel and gear, L.L.Bean offers a slate of free in-store, hands-on clinics along with Outdoor Discovery Schools programs in snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, fly fishing, biking, birdwatching, canoeing, hunting, or any of a dozen other outdoor activities.

Similarly, up-scale home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware has unleashed a new generation of furniture galleries in Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Tampa, and Hollywood that are part store, part interior design studio, part restaurant, and part home:^[15]

> Picture this: You’re sipping a glass of good wine, surrounded by plush furnishings and crystal chandeliers with soothing music playing in the background. You’re not sure whether to order another glass of wine, a light lunch, or both. Instead, you decide to buy the furniture you’re upon which you are sitting. You’re not in a fancy restaurant; you’re in RH Chicago, a new retail concept by Restoration Hardware. Most retail furniture stores do little more than display their wares in functional fashion. Not so at RH galleries. “We wanted to blur the lines between residential and retail, and create a sense of place that is more home than store,” says Restoration Hardware’s CEO. The RH Atlanta gallery is a massive 70,000-square-foot, six-story estate on two acres, complete with a 40-foot-tall entry rotunda flanked by a double staircase, gardens, terraces, a 50-foot-long reflecting pool, and a rooftop park. Its rooms and outdoor places serve as showrooms for the goods that Restoration Hardware sells, from glasses to furniture to rugs to items for the garden. But it feels more like a grand home. You don’t just see the furnishings, you *experience* them. “We created spaces where guests who visit our new homes are saying ‘I want to live here,’” says the CEO. “I’ve been in retail almost 40 years and I’ve never heard anyone say they wanted to live in a retail store, until now.”

Successful retailers carefully orchestrate virtually every aspect of the consumer store experience. The next time you step into a retail store—whether it sells consumer electronics, hardware, food, or high fashion—stop and carefully consider your surroundings. Think about the store’s layout and displays. Listen to the background music. Check out the colors. Smell the smells. Chances are good that everything in the store, from the layout and lighting to the music and even the colors and smells, has been carefully orchestrated to help shape the customers’ shopping experiences—and open their wallets.

For example, retailers choose the colors in their logos and interiors carefully: Black suggests sophistication, orange is associated with fairness and affordability, white signifies simplicity and purity (think Apple stores), and blue connotes trust and dependability (financial institutions use it a lot). And most large retailers have developed signature scents that you smell only in their stores:^[16]

Anytime Fitness pipes in “Inspire,” a eucalyptus-mint fragrance to create a uniform scent from store to store and mask that “gym” smell. Bloomingdale’s uses different essences in different departments: the soft scent of baby powder in the baby store, coconut in the swimsuit area, lilacs in intimate apparel, and sugar cookies and evergreen scent during the holiday season.
