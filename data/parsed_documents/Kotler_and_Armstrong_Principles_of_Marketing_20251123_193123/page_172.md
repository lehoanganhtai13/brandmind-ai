# CHAPTER 5 | Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

But they are also warm and inviting. According to Shinola’s marketer director, “Shinola’s stores are more than a place to buy stuff—they’re centers of activity complete with permanent coffee bars and period events like whisky tastings or pop-up florists and barbershops.” The company plans to open a dozen or more new stores each year going forward.

In another throwback to a bygone era, Shinola is committed to its employees. If you take care of your people, the company believes, they will take care of your customers and your business. Shinola pays its people above-market wages and provides amazing benefits. All employees spend time in the company’s retail stores to gain a clear understanding of the customers for whom they are making products. Shinola has a promote-from-within policy. Today, many of Shinola’s critical operations managers are people who started with the company as security guards, janitors, and delivery people. “We build our goods to last,” says Shinola, “but of all the things we make, American jobs might just be the thing we’re most proud of.”

Thus, Shinola’s well-crafted, deeply felt brand persona has made it special to consumers who identify with its personality. “Shinola is about pride and craft, making things that matter and last, and honoring the past as well as the future,” observes a business writer. “It’s a no-nonsense notion combined with a lot of nostalgia, and it’s the real deal.” “Consumers want something real, something authentic. You want to feel proud about something,” says Shinola’s marketing director. “We have good timing, a good product, and a good story.” In short, nobody’s confusing sh*t with Shinola anymore.

Consumers’ emotions and behaviors toward brands. One ad agency routinely conducts one-on-one, therapy-like interviews to delve the inner workings of consumers. Another company asks consumers to describe their favorite brands as animals or cars (say, a Mercedes versus a Chevy) to assess the prestige associated with various brands. Still others rely on hypnosis, dream therapy, or soft lights and mood music to plumb the murky depths of consumer psyches.

Such projective techniques might seem pretty goofy, and some marketers dismiss such motivation research as mumbo jumbo. But many marketers use such touchy-feely approaches, now sometimes called *interpretive consumer research*, to dig deeper into consumer psyches and develop better marketing strategies.

Abraham Maslow sought to explain why people are driven by particular needs at particular times. Why does one person spend a lot of time and energy on personal safety and another on gaining the esteem of others? Maslow’s answer is that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy, as shown in **Figure 5.3**, from the most pressing at the bottom to the least pressing at the top. They include *physiological* needs, *safety* needs, *social* needs, *esteem* needs, and *self-actualization* needs.

Figure 5.3 illustrates Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, presenting a hierarchical structure of human requirements. At the base are Physiological needs, encompassing hunger and thirst, followed by Safety needs, which include security and protection. Ascending further, Social needs represent the desire for a sense of belonging and love. Above these are Esteem needs, characterized by self-esteem, recognition, and status. Finally, at the apex are Self-actualization needs, relating to self-development and realization. The diagram emphasizes that these needs are arranged in a hierarchy, suggesting that lower-level needs must be met before individuals can focus on higher-level ones, as starving individuals will prioritize basic survival over abstract pursuits. A person tries to satisfy the most important need first.
