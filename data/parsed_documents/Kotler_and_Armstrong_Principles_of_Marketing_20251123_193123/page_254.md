feelings evoked by the logos of companies such as Google, Coca-Cola, Twitter, Apple, and Nike. Logos must be redesigned from time to time. For example, brands ranging from Yahoo!, eBay, and Southwest Airlines to Wendy’s, Pizza Hut, Black+Decker, and Hershey have successfully adapted their logos to keep them contemporary and to meet the needs of new digital devices and interactive platforms such as the mobile apps and social media (see Real Marketing 8.1).

However, companies must take care when changing such important brand symbols. Customers often form strong connections to the visual representations of their brands and may react strongly to changes. ● The Starbucks logo has become one of the most recognizable icons across the globe. The logo has gone through many changes over time with the increasing popularity of the Starbucks brand. However, the company has been careful not to break away from its key design element, the iconic two-tailed mermaid.

Along with the positives, there has been a long history of legal concerns about labels and packaging. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 held that false, misleading, or deceptive labels or packages constitute unfair competition. Labels can mislead customers, fail to describe important ingredients, or fail to include needed safety warnings. As a result, several federal and state laws regulate labeling. The most prominent is the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act of 1966, which set mandatory labeling requirements, encouraged voluntary industry packaging standards, and allowed federal agencies to set packaging regulations in specific industries. The Nutritional Labeling and Educational Act of 1990 requires sellers to provide detailed nutritional information on food products, and recent sweeping actions by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate the use of health-related terms such as *low fat*, *light*, *high fiber*, and *organic*. Sellers must ensure that their labels contain all the required information.

## Product Support Services

Customer service is another element of product strategy. A company’s offer usually includes some support services, which can be a minor part or a major part of the total offering. Later in this chapter, we will discuss services as products in themselves. Here, we discuss services that augment actual products.

Support services are an important part of the customer’s overall brand experience. Lexus knows that good marketing doesn’t end with making a sale. Keeping customers happy *after* the sale is the key to building lasting relationships. Lexus believes that if you delight the customer, and continue to delight the customer, you will have a customer for life. So Lexus dealers across the country will go to almost any lengths to take care of customers and keep them coming back:14

> The typical Lexus dealership is, well, anything but typical. For example, in addition to its Starbucks coffee shop, one Florida Lexus dealership features four massage chairs, two putting greens, two customer lounges, and a library. At another Lexus dealership in a nearby city, “guests” leave their cars with a valet and are then guided by a concierge to a European-style coffee bar offering complimentary espresso, cappuccino, and a selection of pastries prepared by a chef trained in Rome. But at Lexus, customer service goes much deeper than just dealership amenities. From the very start, Lexus set out to revolutionize the auto ownership experience.

Of course, Lexus knows that the best dealership visit is the one you never have to make. So it builds customer-pleasing cars to start with. ● In its “Lexus Covenant,” the company vows that it will make “the finest cars ever built”—high-quality cars that need little servicing. However, the covenant also vows to value customers as important individuals and “treat each customer as we would a guest in our own home.” So, when a car does need servicing, Lexus goes out of its way to make it easy and painless. Most dealers will even pick up a car and then return it when the maintenance is finished. And the car comes back spotless, thanks to a complimentary cleaning. You might even be surprised to find that they’ve touched up a door ding to help restore the car to its fresh-from-the-factory luster.
