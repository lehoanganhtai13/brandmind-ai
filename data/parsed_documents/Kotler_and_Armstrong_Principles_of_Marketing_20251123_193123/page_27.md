# 1 Marketing  
## Creating Customer Value and Engagement

> **CHAPTER PREVIEW**  
> This first chapter introduces you to the basic concepts of marketing. We start with the question: What is marketing? Simply put, marketing is engaging customers and managing profitable customer relationships. The aim of marketing is to create value for customers in order to capture value from customers in return. Next we discuss the five steps in the marketing process—from understanding customer needs, to designing customer value–driven marketing strategies and integrated marketing programs, to building customer relationships and capturing value for the firm. Finally, we discuss the major trends and forces affecting marketing in this new age of digital, mobile, and social media. Understanding these basic concepts and forming your own ideas about what they really mean to you will provide a solid foundation for all that follows.  
> Let’s start with a good story about marketing in action at Emirates, the largest international airline in the world and one of the best-known brands on the planet. Emirate’s success results from much more than just offering a way to connect people from point A to point B. It’s based on a customer-focused marketing strategy by which Emirates creates customer value through deep brand–customer engagement and close brand community with and among its customers.

## EMIRATES’ CUSTOMER VALUE—DRIVEN MARKETING: Engaging Customers and Building a Brand Community

The Emirates Group operates across six continents and 150 cities with a 95,000-strong team comprised of over 160 nationalities. The Emirates airline, headquartered in Dubai, UAE, was founded in 1985. The financial year ending March 31, 2016, saw the Group achieve its 28th consecutive year of profit in a financial year. The company successfully capitalized on its location—a small city-state strategically located to reach three-fourths of the world population in a flight of less than eight hours—to build a fast-growing and profitable hub-based business model, making it the largest international airline in the world.

Emirates set out to be an innovative, modern, and customer-oriented provider of high-quality air travel services. Through the years, Emirates has successfully and continuously created a customer-focused value proposition by offering a combination of products, services, information, and experiences customized for its market demographics for each of its destinations. This approach had led to an array of product offerings such as its onboard Information, Communication, and Entertainment (ICE) system, an all-in-one communications device accommodating customer needs of surfing the Internet, emailing, or simply calling a land line while in the airplane, as well as exclusive lounges for its clientele. These offerings have allowed Emirates to deliver its value proposition to its customers and support its mission statement of committing to high standards.

The Skywards Program, the airlines’ frequent traveler loyalty program, also plays a key role in helping Emirates build strong customer relationships. In an industry-leading innovation, members now earn miles by zone instead of actual miles flown. A “miles accelerator feature” offers bonus miles on specific flights and is designed to boost turnover on flights with less full flights.

Facing increased and fierce competition, Emirates has launched a range of customer service initiatives that support differentiation, including Dubai Connect, an incentive for premium-class passengers offering free luxury hotel accommodation, including meals, ground transportation, and visa costs in Dubai. Another differentiating element of its customer service is Chauffeur-drive, a service offered to customers flying first-class or business-class. Emirates chauffeurs collect customers from their doorstep or will be present to take them to their final destination when they land. This could be straight to the customer’s hotel, their next meeting, their favorite restaurant, or even to the course for a round of golf.
