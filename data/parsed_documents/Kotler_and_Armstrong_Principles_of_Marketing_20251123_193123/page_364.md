For example, the McDonald’s conflict with its franchisees might represent normal give-and-take over the respective rights of the channel partners. However, severe or prolonged conflict can disrupt channel effectiveness and cause lasting harm to channel relationships. McDonald’s should manage the channel conflict carefully to keep it from getting out of hand.

## Vertical Marketing Systems

For the channel as a whole to perform well, each channel member’s role must be specified, and channel conflict must be managed. The channel will perform better if it includes a firm, agency, or mechanism that provides leadership and has the power to assign roles and manage conflict.

Historically, *conventional distribution channels* have lacked such leadership and power, often resulting in damaging conflict and poor performance. One of the biggest channel developments over the years has been the emergence of *vertical marketing systems* that provide channel leadership.  
**Figure 12.3** contrasts the two types of channel arrangements.

A **conventional distribution channel** consists of one or more independent producers, wholesalers, and retailers. Each is a separate business seeking to maximize its own profits, perhaps even at the expense of the system as a whole. No channel member has much control over the other members, and no formal means exists for assigning roles and resolving channel conflict.

In contrast, a **vertical marketing system (VMS)** consists of producers, wholesalers, and retailers acting as a unified system. One channel member owns the others, has contracts with them, or wields so much power that they must all cooperate. The VMS can be dominated by the producer, the wholesaler, or the retailer.

We look now at three major types of VMSs: *corporate*, *contractual*, and *administered*. Each uses a different means for setting up leadership and power in the channel.

### Corporate VMS

A **corporate VMS** integrates successive stages of production and distribution under single ownership. Coordination and conflict management are attained through regular organizational channels. For example, grocery giant Kroger owns and operates 37 manufacturing plants—17 dairies, 6 bakery plants, 5 grocery plants, 1 deli plant, 2 frozen dough plants, 2 beverage plants, 2 cheese plants, and 2 meat plants. That gives it factory-to-store channel control over 40 percent of the 13,000 private-label items found on its shelves.  
Similarly, little-known Italian eyewear maker Luxottica produces many famous eyewear brands—including its own Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol, and Vogue Eyewear.

### Definitions (from left column):

**Conventional distribution channel**  
A channel consisting of one or more independent producers, wholesalers, and retailers, each a separate business seeking to maximize its own profits, perhaps even at the expense of profits for the system as a whole.

**Vertical marketing system (VMS)**  
A channel structure in which producers, wholesalers, and retailers act as a unified system. One channel member owns the others, has contracts with them, or has so much power that they all cooperate.

**Corporate VMS**  
A vertical marketing system that combines successive stages of production and distribution under single ownership—channel leadership is established through common ownership.

### Figure 12.3  
**Comparison of Conventional Distribution Channel with Vertical Marketing System**

This table contrasts conventional marketing channels with vertical marketing systems, illustrating their structural differences. In a conventional channel, the flow is linear: a Producer sells to a Wholesaler, who then sells to a Retailer, and finally to the Consumer. This represents a series of independent entities operating sequentially. In contrast, a vertical marketing system, as depicted, shows a more integrated structure where a Producer might directly engage with a Wholesaler, who in turn works with a Retailer. The key distinction lies in the coordinated efforts within a vertical system, aiming for greater efficiency and control compared to the fragmented nature of conventional channels. The red highlighting on "Retailer" within the vertical system suggests a potential point of emphasis or a specific type of integration being illustrated.

> Vertical marketing system—here’s another fancy term for a simple concept. It’s simply a channel in which members at different levels (hence, vertical) work together in a unified way (hence, system) to accomplish the work of the channel.
