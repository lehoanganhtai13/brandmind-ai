# Company Case Alibaba: The World’s Largest E-tailer Is Not Amazon

There’s a new king of e-commerce, and it dwarfs Amazon. Introducing Alibaba, the China-based behemoth that sold more than $485 billion worth of goods and services last year and is rapidly building an online empire that will include businesses ranging from a traditional online marketplace to online investment services. As successful as Amazon has been, its annual sales of $107 billion are but a fraction of what Alibaba pulled in. In fact, with last year’s take, Alibaba surpassed Walmart to become the largest company on the planet. How is this Chinese upstart pulling off such a startling internet and retailing feat? Let’s start by looking at Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma.

## Unlikely Beginnings  
Jack Ma is an unlikely figure to be atop one of the world’s most powerful companies. Time and again, U.S. tech start-ups have emerged from California garages. However, perhaps none of those start-ups were founded by individuals as seemingly unprepared as Ma. Growing up in Shanghai, Ma did poorly in school. He failed the college entrance exam twice before getting in and completing a teaching degree. He learned to speak English by hanging out around tourists and listening to radio broadcasts. Ma was rejected for a number of jobs—including being a manager for KFC—before finally landing a job teaching English for $12 a month.  
But Ma was animated and energetic, and he had lofty goals and ambitions, a combination that earned him the nickname “Crazy Jack.” During China’s export boom in the 1990s, Ma started a translation company. On a business trip to the United States, he was exposed to the World Wide Web and was surprised to find almost no Chinese content. After a failed attempt at starting an internet company in China, Ma corralled 17 friends in his apartment in 1999 and set out to build an online marketplace. Substituting vision and charisma for coding skills, Ma started Alibaba.com only a few years after legendary e-commerce marketers Amazon and eBay got their starts.

## Feeding the Masses  
It’s difficult to examine Alibaba without making comparisons to the more globally familiar online sellers. In fact, Alibaba is often referred to as the “Amazon of China.” But it’s the differences between Alibaba and the Amazons, eBays, Googles, Walmarts, Costcos, Sears, and thousands of other successful e-tailers that explain how the Chinese company has grown so big and will grow so much bigger in the future.  
For starters, consider the respective domestic markets. Amazon and the others got their starts in the United States, home to roughly 320 million people. This market serves up the most developed retail industry and the highest standard of living in the world. As the tech boom took off, numerous ambitious upstarts competed fiercely to transfer America’s retail businesses into the quickly developing space. Tech-savvy U.S. consumers scrambled to convert some of their buying from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchases.  

Contrast this with China. With 1.3 billion people and the fastest-growing economy in the world, the Chinese market has tremendous power and potential. But perhaps more important, China’s retail sector was still in the Dark Ages when Alibaba got its start. “E-commerce in the United States is like a dessert. It’s just supplementary to your main business,” Ma said recently. “In China, because the infrastructure of [traditional retail] commerce is [so] bad, e-commerce becomes the main course.”  
As many Chinese moved from poverty to middle-class status, their exposure to buying online coincided with their exposure to any kind of buying. Relative to the U.S. market, there were relatively few competitors. The size and nature of China’s market have Alibaba boasting more than 420 million active users, a base that comfortably exceeds the size of the entire population of the United States. And internet penetration in China is still only 52 percent compared with the much more saturated 88 percent in the United States, providing enormous growth potential.  

In adapting traditional retail to an online environment, Amazon and the other U.S. e-tailers operate a “managed marketplace”—they own their own distribution centers, sell a majority of their products directly, and even market their own brands, all characteristics that mimic traditional retail structures. This allows U.S. e-tailers to benefit from established distribution channels and to maintain a great deal of control over their operations. But it also requires massive investments in infrastructure and armies of employees, both of which result in wafer-thin profit margins. In fact, for two of the past four years, Amazon has lost money. For the other two years, the biggest profit it could muster was only 0.5 percent of sales. Walmart’s profit margin percentages for both online and offline sales are typically in the low single digits.  
But Alibaba does not own or operate massive distribution centers. It doesn’t own the items sold on its sites. And it only employs about 36,000 people, a fraction of Amazon’s 230,000 employees. Instead, Alibaba’s open market platform simply connects buyers with sellers. That might sound like an eBay approach, but Ma insists that it is not. “Amazon and eBay are e-commerce companies, and Alibaba is not an e-commerce company,” Ma said recently. “Alibaba helps others to do e-commerce. We do not sell things.” While this gives Alibaba less control over the customer experience, Ma sleeps easier at night without the burden of obsessing over keeping prices low. As market forces work to set price points, Alibaba sits back and watches the cash pour in. Its profit margin over the past three years averaged about 40 percent.

## A Little of Everything  
The continuous influx of cash has allowed Alibaba to invest in just about every kind of business imaginable. In its infancy, Alibaba.com primarily matched Chinese exporters with businesses throughout the rest of the world. But the company quickly shifted focus, catering to the growing purchasing power of its domestic market.
