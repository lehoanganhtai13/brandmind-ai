## FIGURE 13.2  
Wholesaler Marketing Strategies

This table outlines a wholesale strategy focused on creating value for targeted wholesale customers. The strategy encompasses two main areas: segmentation and targeting, and differentiation and service positioning. These strategic elements inform the wholesale marketing mix, which comprises product and service assortment, wholesale prices, promotion, and distribution, specifically location. The overarching goal is to leverage these marketing mix components to effectively serve and add value to chosen wholesale customer segments. The structure is hierarchical, with the overarching strategy guiding the tactical marketing mix elements, all aimed at the central objective of customer value creation.

> Why does this figure look so much like Figure 13.1? You guessed it. Like retailers, wholesalers must develop customer-driven marketing strategies and mixes that create value for customers and capture value in return. For example, Grainger helps its business customers “save time and money by providing them with the right products and solutions to keep their facilities up and running.”

## Marketing Mix Decisions

Like retailers, wholesalers must decide on product and service assortments, prices, promotion, and place. Wholesalers add customer value though the *products and services* they offer. They are often under great pressure to carry a full line and stock enough for immediate delivery. But this practice can damage profits. Wholesalers today are cutting down on the number of lines they carry, choosing to carry only the more profitable ones. They are also rethinking which services count most in building strong customer relationships and which should be dropped or paid for by the customer. The key for companies is to find the mix of services most valued by their target customers.

*Price* is also an important wholesaler decision. Wholesalers usually mark up the cost of goods by a standard percentage and operate on small margins. As retail and industrial customers face increasing costs and margins pressures, they turn to wholesalers, looking for lower prices. Wholesalers may, in turn, cut their margins on some lines to keep important customers. They may also ask suppliers for special price breaks in cases when they can turn them into an increase in the supplier’s sales.

Although *promotion* can be critical to wholesaler success, most wholesalers are not promotion minded. They have historically used largely scattered and unplanned trade advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, and public relations. Like other business-to-business marketers, wholesalers need to make a team effort to sell, build, and service major accounts. Wholesalers also need to adopt some of the nonpersonal promotion techniques used by retailers. They need to develop an overall promotion strategy and make greater use of supplier promotion materials and programs.

Digital and social media are playing an increasingly important role in wholesaler promotion. For example, Grainger maintains an active presence on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+. It also provides a feature-rich mobile app. On its YouTube channel, Grainger lists more than 500 videos on topics ranging from the company and its products and services to keeping down inventory costs.

Finally, *distribution* (location) is important. Wholesalers must choose their locations, facilities, and other locations carefully. There was a time when wholesalers could locate in low-rent, low-tax areas and invest little money in their buildings, equipment, and systems. Today, however, as technology zooms forward, such behavior results in outdated systems for material handling, order processing, and delivery.

Instead, today’s large and progressive wholesalers have reacted to rising costs by investing in automated warehouses and IT systems. Orders are fed from the retailer’s information system directly into the wholesaler’s, and the items are picked up by mechanical devices and automatically taken to a shipping platform where they are assembled. Most large wholesalers use technology to carry out accounting, billing, inventory control, and forecasting. Modern wholesalers are adapting their services to the needs of target customers and finding cost-reducing methods of doing business. They are also transacting more business online.
