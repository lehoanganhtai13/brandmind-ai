The company also needs to choose in *how many* countries it wants to market. Companies must be careful not to spread themselves too thin or expand beyond their capabilities by operating in too many countries too soon. Next, the company needs to decide on the *types* of countries to enter. A country’s attractiveness depends on the product, geographical factors, income and population, political climate, and other considerations. In recent years, many major new markets have emerged, offering both substantial opportunities and daunting challenges.

After listing possible international markets, the company must carefully evaluate each one. It must consider many factors. For example, Amazon’s decision to expand into India seems like a no-brainer. The online merchant is already doing well in such global markets as Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, which combined with the United States produce 95 percent of Amazon’s profits. India is now the world’s fastest-growing economy, with a population of 1.25 billion people, four times the U.S. population and double Europe’s. What’s more, only one-quarter of India’s population now has access to the internet and only a small proportion of Indians have ever shopped online, leaving explosive room for growth in online shopping.

However, as Amazon considers expanding into new markets such as India, it must ask some important questions. Can it compete effectively with local competitors? Can it master the varied cultural and buying differences of Indian consumers? Will it be able to meet environmental and regulatory hurdles in each country? Can it overcome some daunting infrastructure problems?

In entering India, Amazon faces many challenges. For example, it must confront two established local competitors there—Flipkart and Snapdeal—plus a slew of smaller Indian start-ups. Flipkart, by itself, currently captures 44 percent of India’s e-commerce compared with Amazon’s 15 percent. Amazon also faces a tangle of Indian regulations, including a law that forbids foreign companies from selling directly to Indians. Thus,

> rather than buying goods and reselling them as it does in the United States, Amazon in India will be only a platform for vendors, similar to its “fulfillment by Amazon” operations in the West.

Package delivery is another major obstacle. India is characterized by muddy, potholed rural roads or congested city streets with arcane address systems, and there are no reliable delivery services such FedEx, UPS, or the postal service. To make speedy deliveries, Amazon has had to set up its own motorcycle delivery service, consisting of thousands of motorbike riders with large black backpacks who race around the country delivering packages. Still another concern is payment. Only 60 percent of Indians have bank accounts, and only a small fraction of those have credit cards. Most customers pay cash for home-delivered purchases or when they collect their packages from local shops across the country that serve as pick-up and payment points. The small local shops also serve as online ordering spots for the majority of Indian consumers who have no internet connections. Store owners guide customers through Amazon’s site, write down their orders, and collect the cash when orders are picked up from the shop.

Entering new global markets: Amazon’s entry into India seems like a no-brainer. But it’s also a very large and complex undertaking. The challenge is summed up by this slogan: “Transforming the way India sells, transforming the way India buys.” Mint/Getty Images

Thus, Amazon’s decision to enter India is, in fact, a no-brainer. “The size of the opportunity is so large it will be measured in trillions, not billions—trillions of dollars, that is, not rupees,” says Amazon’s senior vice president for international retail. But it’s also a very large and complex undertaking. A slogan posted on the wall in Amazon’s Hyderabad warehouse sums up the challenge: “Transforming the way India sells, transforming the way India buys.”[^29]

Possible global markets should be ranked on several factors, including market size, market growth, the cost of doing business, competitive advantage, and risk level. The goal is to determine the potential of each market, using indicators such as those shown in

**Table 19.1.** Then the marketer must decide which markets offer the greatest long-run return on investment.
