# Marketing Ethics  
## Ethical Sourcing

Lush, the fresh handmade cosmetics company, was launched in 1994, and included the same creative team who designed many amazing products for The Body Shop. In less than 20 years of its establishment, Lush has grown to a network of over 850 stores in more than 50 countries worldwide and over 6,000 employees. From the outset, the company was keen on ensuring that they sourced their product ingredients ethically. This has become their key USP, and together with the anti-animal-testing stance and the ethos of making fresh cosmetics, the business stands apart from most of its competitors. It does mean that the prices of their products are marginally higher, but this is offset by the unique, minimalist packaging and general vibe of the brand. When Lush looks for suppliers, they consider the whole picture; they take into account the conditions under which the workers may operate and also consider how the production of the ingredients affects the environment. For Lush, it is important that the ingredients used for the cosmetics should be vegetarian, not tested on animals, and have minimal impact as far as transportation is concerned. Today, the company indirectly supports 400 women in Ghana who supply fair-trade Shea Butter and has stopped using palm oil from Indonesia in order to protect the natural habitat of the orangutan. They also buy directly from small farmers in Tunisia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Laos.

**12-11** Write a brief report on a business of your choice that supports ethical sourcing. What criteria are being used to establish the ethical standards under which they operate? (AACSB: Written and Oral Communication; Reflective Thinking)

**12-12** Should ethical sourcing be the default standard for all businesses? (AACSB: Written and Oral Communication; Reflective Thinking; Ethical Understanding and Reasoning)

# Marketing by the Numbers  
## Tyson Expanding Distribution

Tyson Foods is the largest U.S. beef and chicken supplier, processing more than 100,000 head of cattle and 40-plus million chickens weekly. Primary distribution channels are supermarket meat departments. However, the company is now expanding distribution into convenience stores. There are almost 150,000 gas stations and convenience stores where the company would like to sell hot buffalo chicken bites near the checkout. This is a promising channel, as sales are growing considerably at these retail outlets and profit margins on prepared foods are higher than selling raw meat to grocery stores. Tyson will have to hire 10 more sales representatives at a salary of $45,000 each to expand into this distribution channel because many of these types of stores are independently owned. Each convenience store is expected to generate an average of $50,000 in revenue for Tyson. Refer to Appendix 2: Marketing by the Numbers to answer the following questions.

**12-13** If Tyson’s contribution margin is 30 percent on this product, what increase in sales will it need to break even on the increase in fixed costs to hire the new sales reps? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

**12-14** How many new retail accounts must the company acquire to break even on this tactic? What average number of accounts must each new rep acquire? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

# Video Case  
## Progressive

Progressive has attained top-tier status in the insurance industry by focusing on innovation. Progressive was the first company to offer drive-in claims service, installment payment of premiums, and 24/7 customer service. But perhaps Progressive’s most innovative moves involve its channels of distribution. Whereas most insurance companies distribute via intermediary agents or direct-to-consumer methods, Progressive was one of the first to see value in doing both. In the late 1980s, it augmented its agency distribution with a direct 800-number channel.

Two decades ago, Progressive moved into the digital future by becoming the first major insurer to launch a website. Soon after, it allowed customers to buy auto insurance policies online in real time. Today, customers can use Progressive’s website to do everything from managing their own account information to reporting claims directly. Progressive even offers one-stop concierge claim service.

After viewing the Progressive video segment, answer the following questions about marketing channels.

**12-15** Apply the concept of the supply chain to Progressive.

**12-16** Using the model of consumer and business channels found in the chapter, sketch out as many channels for Progressive as you can. How does each of these channels meet distinct customer needs?

**12-17** Discuss the various ways that Progressive has had an impact on the insurance industry.
