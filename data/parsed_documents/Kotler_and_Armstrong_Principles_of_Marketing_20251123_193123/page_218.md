# Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

For instance, Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurants, both owned by parent company CKE Restaurants, focus on a target of “young, hungry men.” These young male customers, ages 18 to 34, fully embrace the chain’s “If you’re gonna eat, eat like you mean it” positioning. That means they wolf down a lot more Thickburgers and other indulgent items featured on the chains’ menus. ● To attract this audience, the company is known for its steamy hot-models-in-bikinis commercials, featuring models such as Kate Upton, Charlotte McKinney, Nina Agdal, and Hannah Ferguson to heat up the brands’ images. Such ads clearly show “what our target audience of young, hungry guys like,” says CKE’s chief executive.10

## Loyalty Status

A market can also be segmented by consumer loyalty. Consumers can be loyal to brands (Tide), stores (Target), and companies (Apple). Buyers can be divided into groups according to their degree of loyalty. Some consumers are completely loyal—they buy one brand all the time and can’t wait to tell others about it. For example, whether they own a MacBook Pro, an iPhone, or an iPad, Apple devotees are granite-like in their devotion to the brand. At one end are the quietly satisfied Apple users, folks who own one or several Apple devices and use them for browsing, texting, email, and social networking. At the other extreme, however, are the Apple zealots—the so-called MacHeads or Macolytes—who can’t wait to tell anyone within earshot of their latest Apple gadget. Such loyal Apple devotees helped keep Apple afloat during the lean years a decade ago, and they are now at the forefront of Apple’s huge iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iTunes empire.

Other consumers are somewhat loyal—they are loyal to two or three brands of a given product or favor one brand while sometimes buying others. Still other buyers show no loyalty to any brand—they either want something different each time they buy, or they buy whatever’s on sale.

A company can learn a lot by analyzing loyalty patterns in its market. It should start by studying its own loyal customers. Highly loyal customers can be a real asset. They often promote the brand through personal word of mouth and social media. Instead of just marketing to loyal customers, companies should engage them fully and make them partners in building the brand and telling the brand story. For example, Mountain Dew has turned its loyal customers into a “Dew Nation” of passionate superfans who have made it the nation’s number-three liquid refreshment brand behind only Coca-Cola and Pepsi (see Real Marketing 7.1).

Some companies actually put loyalists to work for the brand. For example, Patagonia relies on its most tried-and-true customers—what it calls Patagonia ambassadors—to field-test products in harsh environments, provide input for “ambassador-driven” lines of apparel and gear, and share their product experiences with others.11 In contrast, by studying its less-loyal buyers, a company can detect which brands are most competitive with its own. By looking at customers who are shifting away from its brand, the company can learn about its marketing weaknesses and take actions to correct them.

## Using Multiple Segmentation Bases

Marketers rarely limit their segmentation analysis to only one or a few variables. Rather, they often use multiple segmentation bases in an effort to identify smaller, better-defined target groups. Several business information services—such as Nielsen, Acxiom, Esri, and Experian—provide multivariable segmentation systems that merge geographic, demographic, lifestyle, and behavioral data to help companies segment their markets down to zip codes, neighborhoods, and even households.

One of the leading consumer segmentation systems is Experian Marketing Services’ Mosaic USA system. ● It classifies U.S. households into one of 71 lifestyle segments and 19 overarching groups based on income, age, buying habits, household composition, and life events. Mosaic USA segments carry exotic names such as Birkenstocks and Beemers,

Targeting heavy users: Sister chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. use steamy hot-models-in-bikinis commercials to attract an audience of “young, hungry men,” who wolf down a lot more of the chains’ featured Thickburgers and other indulgent items than consumers in other segments.
