# Retailer Marketing Decisions

> **Author Comment:** Not surprisingly, retailers must make the same types of segmentation, positioning, and marketing mix of decisions as any other marketer.

In the past, retailers attracted customers with unique product assortments and more or better services. Today, the assortments and services of various retailers are looking more and more alike. You can find most consumer brands not only in department stores but also in mass-merchandise discount stores, off-price discount stores, and all over the internet. Thus, it’s now more difficult for any one retailer to offer exclusive merchandise.

Service differentiation among retailers has also eroded. Many department stores have trimmed their services, whereas discounters have increased theirs. In addition, customers have become smarter and more price sensitive. They see no reason to pay more for identical brands, especially when service differences are shrinking. For all these reasons, many retailers today are rethinking their marketing strategies.

As shown in **Figure 13.1**, retailers face major marketing decisions about *segmentation and targeting, store differentiation and positioning*, and the *retail marketing mix*.

## Segmentation, Targeting, Differentiation, and Positioning Decisions

Retailers must first segment and define their target markets and then decide how they will differentiate and position themselves in these markets. Should they focus on upscale, midscale, or downscale shoppers? Do target shoppers want variety, depth of assortment, convenience, or low prices? Until they define and profile their markets, retailers cannot make consistent decisions about product assortment, services, pricing, advertising, store décor, online and mobile site design, or any of the other decisions that must support their positions.

Too many retailers, even big ones, fail to clearly define their target markets and positions. For example, what market does clothing chain Gap target? What is Gap’s value proposition? If you’re having trouble answering those questions, you’re not alone—so is Gap’s management.¹³

In its heyday, Gap was solidly positioned on “effortless cool”—the then-fashionable preppy look focused on comfortable, casual clothes and easy shopping. But as its core Generation X customers aged and moved on, Gap stores didn’t. Moving into the 2000s, Gap catered to short-lived fashion trends that alienated its loyal customer base. At the same time, it has struggled unsuccessfully to define new positioning that works with today’s younger shoppers. And more-contemporary fast-fashion retailers such as H&M, Forever 21, Zara, and Uniqlo have moved in aggressively on Gap’s turf. Whereas these brands are clearly targeted and positioned, Gap’s identity has become muddled. As a result, the chain’s sales have flattened or fallen off, and last year it closed 175 of its 675 North American stores. 

> “Neither they nor their consumer know exactly who they are targeting,” says one retail analyst. Gap “hasn’t got a story,” says another. Is it “trying to sell to my wife or my teenage daughter or both? I don’t think you can do both.” To rekindle the brand, Gap needs to “define who the brand’s core customers are and be exceptional to them.”

### Figure 13.1 Retailer Marketing Strategies

This table outlines the relationship between retail strategy and the retail marketing mix, both aimed at creating value for targeted retail customers. The retail strategy encompasses segmentation and targeting, defining which customer groups to serve, and store differentiation and positioning, establishing how the retail offering will be perceived relative to competitors. These strategic decisions then inform the development of the retail marketing mix, which comprises four key elements: the product and service assortment offered, the retail prices set, the promotional activities undertaken, and the distribution strategy, primarily focusing on store location. Together, these components form a cohesive approach to attracting and serving specific customer segments.

> As with other types of marketers, the name of the game for retailers is to find the customer value–driven marketing strategy and mix that will let them create value for customers and capture value in return. Think of Target’s “Expect More. Pay Less.” value proposition. And Lowe’s “Never stop improving.” By contrast, successful retailers define their target markets well and position themselves strongly.
