# The Global Marketplace

Supercenter. To offset such massive size, IKEA stores everywhere are divided into three main sections: *Showrooms* display furnishings in real-room settings, the *marketplace* houses small items, and the *warehouse* makes it easy for customers to pull their own furniture items in flat-pack boxes and cart them to checkout. At any IKEA in the world, parents can drop off their children in the IKEA Småland play area and feed the entire family in the snack bar or the three-meal-a-day restaurant, making it easy to hang around and shop for hours.

Although IKEA tries to standardize its operations as much as possible, however, it has learned that, in global marketing, one size rarely fits all. IKEA found this out the hard way in the early 1980s when it opened its first U.S. store in Philadelphia and stocked it by importing the same goods it sold in Europe. Americans weren’t much impressed. For example, IKEA carried beds that were too small and too firm for American tastes. Sales suffered, and IKEA considered pulling out of the U.S. market altogether.

Instead, the company made a decision that would become the cornerstone for its expansions into all-new international markets—study the market intensely and adapt accordingly. “The more far away we go from our culture, the more we need to understand, learn, and adapt,” says IKEA’s head of research. Fueled by a better understanding of U.S. consumers, IKEA changed the composition of its mattresses and added king-size beds. After similar changes storewide, sales took off. The United States is now IKEA’s second-largest market behind only Germany.

IKEA now routinely adjusts its product designs and assortments worldwide to meet the distinct needs and tastes of local consumers. For example, although IKEA stores in China carry many of the same items found in other parts of the world, they also heavy up on rice cookers and chopsticks. The Chinese love a good, hard mattress, so IKEA sells mostly firmer ones there. And because the average living space in China’s crowded cities is much smaller than in Europe and the United States, Chinese IKEAs stock smaller appliances and products geared toward saving space and organizing a household.

But there are limits to how much IKEA can adapt product designs and assortments without increasing costs. Says one analyst, “The IKEA model, remember, is volume, volume, volume: It needs vast economies of scale to keep costs low, and that means creating one-size-fits-all solutions as often as possible.” So instead of making wholesale product changes around the globe, IKEA often simply adapts its marketing and merchandising to show locals how IKEA’s standard products fit with their lives and cultures. “IKEA has gotten awfully good at showing how the same product can mesh with different regional habitats,” says the analyst.

For example, showrooms in Japan and the Netherlands may feature the same beds and cabinets, but the Japanese display might show tatami mats while the Dutch room incorporates slanted ceilings. In the United States, those same beds will be covered with decorative pillows. Similarly, the heavily circulated IKEA catalog (more than 217 million printed each year) is customized to show standard IKEA products in localized settings. IKEA publishes 67 versions of the catalog in 32 languages, each one carefully prepared to reflect local tastes and preferences.

Beyond adapting designs, assortments, and merchandising, IKEA often adjusts its basic store operations to turn local cultural nuances into competitive advantages. For example, IKEA’s Chinese stores are a big draw for up-and-coming Chinese consumers. But IKEA customers in China want a lot more from its stores than just affordable Scandinavian-designed furniture.

In Chinese, IKEA is known as Yi Jia. Translated, it means “comfortable home,” a concept taken literally by the millions of consumers who visit one of IKEA’s 20 huge Chinese stores each year. “Customers come on family outings, hop into display beds and nap, pose for snapshots with the décor, and hang out for hours to enjoy the air conditioning and free soda refills,” notes one observer. On a typical Saturday afternoon, for example, display beds and other furniture in a huge Chinese IKEA store are occupied, with customers of all ages lounging or even fast asleep. One Chinese IKEA has even hosted several weddings.

Whereas this might be considered as unwanted loitering in the United States or other Western markets, IKEA managers in China encourage such behavior, figuring that familiarity with the store will result in later purchasing when shoppers’ incomes eventually rise to match their aspirations. “Maybe if you’ve been visiting IKEA, eating meatballs, hot dogs, or ice cream for 10 years, then maybe you will consider IKEA when you get yourself a sofa,” says the company’s Asia-Pacific president.

No matter where in the world you shop at IKEA, you’ll find the huge and familiar blue-and-yellow stores and large selections of Scandinavian-design furnishings at affordable prices. At the same time, IKEA carefully adapts its merchandise and marketing to the unique needs of customers in specific global markets.
