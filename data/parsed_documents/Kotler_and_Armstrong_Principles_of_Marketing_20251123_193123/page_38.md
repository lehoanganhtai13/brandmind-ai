# Three Considerations Underlying the Societal Marketing Concept

The societal marketing concept is depicted as a framework integrating three key stakeholders: Consumers, the Company, and Society. Consumers are driven by their want satisfaction, while the Company aims for profits. Society's interests are represented by human welfare. The overarching societal marketing concept acts as a central integrating element, mediating the relationship between these three components. This structure suggests a balanced approach where consumer needs and company objectives are pursued in a manner that also considers and promotes the well-being of society. The diagram illustrates a multi-faceted consideration beyond simple buyer-seller exchanges, emphasizing a broader societal impact.

### Societal marketing concept

The idea that a company’s marketing decisions should consider consumers’ wants, the company’s requirements, consumers’ long-run interests, and society’s long-run interests.

### The Societal Marketing Concept

The **societal marketing concept** questions whether the pure marketing concept overlooks possible conflicts between consumer *short-run wants* and consumer *long-run welfare*. Is a firm that satisfies the immediate needs and wants of target markets always doing what’s best for its consumers in the long run? The societal marketing concept holds that marketing strategy should deliver value to customers in a way that maintains or improves both the consumer’s *and* society’s well-being. It calls for **sustainable marketing**, socially and environmentally responsible marketing that meets the present needs of consumers and businesses while also preserving or enhancing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Even more broadly, many leading business and marketing thinkers are now preaching the concept of **shared value**, which recognizes that societal needs, not just economic needs, define markets. The concept of shared value focuses on creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society. A growing number of companies known for their hard-nosed approaches to business—such as GE, Dow, Google, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Nestlé, Unilever, and Walmart—are rethinking the interactions between society and corporate performance. They are concerned not just with short-term economic gains but with the well-being of their customers, the depletion of natural resources vital to their businesses, the viability of key suppliers, and the economic well-being of the communities in which they operate.

One prominent marketer calls this *Marketing 3.0*. “Marketing 3.0 organizations are values-driven,” he says. “I’m not talking about being value-driven. I’m talking about ‘values’ plural, where values amount to caring about the state of the world.” Another marketer calls it *purpose-driven marketing*. “The future of profit is purpose,” he says.

As **Figure 1.4** shows, companies should balance three considerations in setting their marketing strategies: company profits, consumer wants, *and* society’s interests. Online grocer Door to Door Organics operates this way:

- Door to Door Organics delivers fresh, high-quality, organic, natural, and local meat, dairy, produce, and groceries directly to homes, offices, and schools in 16 states across the country. Customers order online and receive weekly deliveries to their doorsteps year-round.
- But Door to Door Organics does much more than just sell groceries online for profit. It also dedicates itself to a deeply felt mission “to bring more Good Food—food that positively impacts health, communities, and the environment—to more people in a sustainable way.” It wants to “make a positive impact on our food system, make people healthier, connect communities, grow local economies, and inspire people to eat Good Food.”
- To meet its ambitious Good Food mission, Door to Door sources most of what it sells from local family farms and businesses who are “dedicated stewards of the land and use USDA-certified organic practices that are healthier for both animals and people, better for the soil, and reduce carbon emissions.” Door to Door delivers to specified areas on specific days of the week, maintaining a tight delivery radius.
