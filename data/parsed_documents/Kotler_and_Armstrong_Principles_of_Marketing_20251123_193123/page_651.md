Although each sales rep works 2,000 hours per year (50 weeks per year × 40 hours per week), they spent about 15 hours per week on nonselling activities such as administrative duties and travel. Thus, the average annual available selling time per sales rep per year is 1,250 hours (50 weeks × 25 hours per week). We can now calculate how many sales reps HD will need to cover the anticipated 2,500 retail outlets:

$$
NS = \frac{2,500 \times 20 \times 2}{1,250} = 80 \text{ salespeople}
$$

Therefore, HD will need to hire 20 more salespeople. The cost to hire these reps will be $1 million (20 salespeople × $50,000 salary per sales person).

What increase in sales will be required to break even on this increase in fixed costs? The 10% commission is already accounted for in the contribution margin, so the contribution margin remains unchanged at 21%. Thus, the increase in sales needed to cover this increase in fixed costs can be calculated by:

$$
\text{Increase in sales} = \frac{\text{increase in fixed cost}}{\text{contribution margin}} = \frac{1,000,000}{0.21} = \$4,761,905
$$

That is, HD’s sales must increase almost $5 million to break even on this tactic. So, how many new retail outlets will the company need to secure to achieve this sales increase? The average revenue generated per current outlet is $53,333 ($100 million in sales divided by 1,875 outlets). To achieve the nearly $5 million sales increase needed to break even, HD would need about 90 new outlets ($4,761,905 ÷ $53,333 = 89.3 outlets), or about 4.5 outlets per new rep. Given that current reps cover about 31 outlets apiece (1,875 outlets ÷ 60 reps), this seems very reasonable.

## Decrease Price

HD is also considering lowering its price to increase sales revenue through increased volume. The company’s research has shown that demand for most types of consumer electronics products is elastic—that is, the percentage increase in the quantity demanded is greater than the percentage decrease in price.

What increase in sales would be necessary to break even on a 10% decrease in price? That is, what increase in sales will be needed to maintain the total contribution that HD realized at the higher price? The current total contribution can be determined by multiplying the contribution margin by total sales:

$$
\text{Current total contribution} = \text{contribution margin} \times \text{sales} = 0.21 \times 100 \text{ million} = 21 \text{ million}
$$

Price changes result in changes in unit contribution and contribution margin. Recall that the contribution margin of 21% was based on variable costs representing 79% of sales. Therefore, unit variable costs can be determined by multiplying the original price by this percentage: $168 \times 0.79 = 132.72$ per unit. If price is decreased by 10%, the new price is $151.20. However, variable costs do not change just because price decreased, so the contribution and contribution margin decrease as follows:

This data presents a comparative analysis of pricing and cost components before and after a 10% price reduction. The 'Old' column shows an initial price of $168 with a unit variable cost of $132.72, resulting in a unit contribution of $35.28 and a contribution margin of 21%. The 'New (reduced 10%)' column illustrates the impact of the price decrease, with the new price set at $151.20. Crucially, the unit variable cost remains unchanged at $132.72. This leads to a significantly reduced unit contribution of $18.48 and a corresponding drop in the contribution margin to 12%. The structure highlights the direct relationship between price changes and contribution margin, assuming stable variable costs. So a 10% reduction in price results in a decrease in the contribution margin from 21% to 12%.⁶ To determine the sales level needed to break even on this price reduction, we calculate the level of sales that must be attained at the new contribution margin to achieve the original total contribution of $21 million:
