the company and its products. Conversely, poor salesperson relationships will probably result in poor company and product relationships.

## Coordinating Marketing and Sales

Ideally, the sales force and other marketing functions (marketing planners, brand managers, marketing content managers, and researchers) should work together closely to jointly create value for customers. Unfortunately, however, some companies still treat sales and marketing as separate functions. When this happens, the separate sales and marketing groups may not get along well. When things go wrong, marketers blame the sales force for its poor execution of what they see as an otherwise splendid strategy. In turn, the sales team blames the marketers for being out of touch with what’s really going on with customers. Neither group fully values the other’s contributions. However, if not repaired, such disconnects between marketing and sales can damage customer relationships and company performance.

A company can take several actions to help bring its marketing and sales functions closer together. At the most basic level, it can increase communications between the two groups by arranging joint meetings and spelling out communication channels. It can create opportunities for salespeople and marketers to work together. Brand managers and researchers can tag along on sales calls or sit in on sales planning sessions. In turn, salespeople can sit in on marketing planning sessions and share their firsthand customer knowledge.

A company can also create joint objectives and reward systems for sales and marketing teams or appoint marketing–sales liaisons—people from marketing who “live with the sales force” and help coordinate marketing and sales force programs and efforts. Finally, it can appoint a high-level marketing executive to oversee both marketing and sales. Such a person can help infuse marketing and sales with the common goal of creating value for customers to capture value in return.²

## Managing the Sales Force

We define **sales force management** as analyzing, planning, implementing, and controlling sales force activities. It includes designing sales force strategy and structure as well as recruiting, selecting, training, compensating, supervising, and evaluating the firm’s salespeople. These major sales force management decisions are shown in Figure 16.1 and discussed in the following sections.

## Designing the Sales Force Strategy and Structure

Marketing managers face several sales force strategy and design questions. How should salespeople and their tasks be structured? How big should the sales force be? Should salespeople sell alone or work in teams with other people in the company? Should they sell in the field, by phone, or using online and social media? We address these issues next.

Figure 16.1 outlines the major steps involved in sales force management, presenting a sequential, process-based structure. The process begins with designing the overall sales force strategy and structure. This is followed by the crucial steps of recruiting and selecting appropriate individuals for the sales team. Once recruited, salespeople undergo training to equip them with necessary skills and knowledge. Subsequently, a compensation system is established to incentivize and reward performance. The management process continues with supervising salespeople to ensure adherence to strategies and provide ongoing support. Finally, the cycle concludes with the evaluation of salespeople, likely to assess performance against objectives and inform future strategic decisions.

> The goal of this process? You guessed it! The company wants to build a skilled and motivated sales team that will help to engage customers, create customer value, and build strong customer relationships.
