# APPENDIX 2 | Marketing by the Numbers

Markups are usually expressed as a percentage, and there are two different ways to compute markups—on *cost* or on *selling price*:

$$
\text{Markup percentage on cost} = \frac{\text{dollar markup}}{\text{cost}}
$$

$$
\text{Markup percentage on selling price} = \frac{\text{dollar markup}}{\text{selling price}}
$$

To apply reseller margin analysis, HD must first set the suggested retail price and then work back to the price at which it must sell the product to a wholesaler. Suppose retailers expect a 30% margin and wholesalers want a 20% margin based on their respective selling prices. And suppose that HD sets a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $299.99 for its product.

HD selected the $299.99 MSRP because it is lower than most competitors’ prices but is not so low that consumers might perceive it to be of poor quality. And the company’s research shows that it is below the threshold at which more consumers are willing to purchase the product. By using buyers’ perceptions of value and not the seller’s cost to determine the MSRP, HD is using **value-based pricing**. For simplicity, we will use an MSRP of $300 in further analyses.

To determine the price HD will charge wholesalers, we must first subtract the retailer’s margin from the retail price to determine the retailer’s cost ($300 − ($300 × 0.30) = $210). The retailer’s cost is the wholesaler’s price, so HD next subtracts the wholesaler’s margin ($210 − ($210 × 0.20) = $168). Thus, the **markup chain** representing the sequence of markups used by firms at each level in a channel for HD’s new product is:

This data outlines a cost breakdown, illustrating a hierarchical price reduction from suggested retail price to the manufacturer's (HD's) price. It begins with a suggested retail price of $300, from which a 30% retail margin of $90 is subtracted, resulting in a retailer's cost or wholesaler's price of $210. This wholesaler's price is then reduced by a 20% wholesaler's margin of $42. The final figure presented is the wholesaler's cost, which is also identified as HD's price, calculated at $168. The structure is comparative, showing how each successive margin reduces the overall price down the supply chain.

By deducting the markups for each level in the markup chain, HD arrives at a price for the product to wholesalers of $168.

## Break-Even and Margin Analysis

The previous analyses derived a value-based price of $168 for HD’s product. Although this price is higher than the break-even price of $145 and covers costs, that price assumed a demand of 1 million units. But how many units and what level of dollar sales must HD achieve to break even at the $168 price? And what level of sales must be achieved to realize various profit goals? These questions can be answered through break-even and margin analysis.

### Determining Break-Even Unit Volume and Dollar Sales

Based on an understanding of costs, consumer value, the competitive environment, and reseller requirements, HD has decided to set its price to wholesalers at $168. At that price, what sales level will be needed for HD to break even or make a profit on its product? **Break-even analysis** determines the unit volume and dollar sales needed to be profitable given a particular price and cost structure. At the break-even point, total revenue equals total costs and profit is zero. Above this point, the company will make a profit; below it, the company will lose money. HD can calculate break-even volume using the following formula:

$$
\text{Break-even volume} = \frac{\text{fixed costs}}{\text{price} - \text{unit variable cost}}
$$

The denominator (price − unit variable cost) is called **unit contribution** (sometimes called contribution margin). It represents the amount that each unit contributes to covering fixed costs—the difference between price and variable costs.
