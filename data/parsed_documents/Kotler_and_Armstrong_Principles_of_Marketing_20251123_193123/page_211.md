# 7 Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy:  
## Creating Value for Target Customers

> So far, you’ve learned what marketing is and about the importance of understanding consumers and the marketplace. With that as a background, we now delve deeper into marketing strategy and tactics. This chapter looks further into key customer value–driven marketing strategy decisions—dividing up markets into meaningful customer groups (*segmentation*), choosing which customer groups to serve (*targeting*), creating market offerings that best serve targeted customers (*differentiation*), and positioning the offerings in the minds of consumers (*positioning*). The chapters that follow explore the tactical marketing tools—the four Ps—by which marketers bring these strategies to life.  
> To open our discussion of segmentation, targeting, differentiation, and positioning, let’s look at Henkel. For nearly 140 years, Henkel has wielded a leader’s influence with its varied offering of products that address the specialized needs of global customers. Henkel’s brand Persil has revolutionized the Middle Eastern market through sophisticated segmentation and targeting, with each product line offering a unique value proposition to a distinct segment of customers.

## HENKEL’S PERSIL: A “Glocal” Marketing Success

Henkel AG & Company, KGaA, a well-known German multinational company active both in the consumer and industrial sector, was founded in September 1876 by Fritz Henkel in Aachen, Germany. The first product it launched was a silicate-based universal detergent; ever since, the company has been successful through continuous innovation in new products that satisfy a range of diverse customers and their different needs and preferences across the globe. Today, Henkel—which is headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany—is globally ranked among the Fortune Global 500 companies. In the fiscal year 2015, Henkel reported sales of $18.97 billion and an operating profit of $3.06 billion. In *Fortune*’s recent “World’s Most Admired Companies” ranking, Henkel was confirmed as one of the most reputable companies in its industry category, finishing in fourth place. In 2016, Henkel was again the only German company in the Top 50 of the world’s biggest consumer-goods manufacturers worldwide according to consulting firm OC&C’s study “Trends and Strategies on the Consumer-goods Market.”  
Henkel’s force of around 50,000 employees worldwide is working hard to gain the trust of a customer base in more than 120 countries with several successful brands, particularly Persil. For over 109 years, Persil has been regarded as the expert in sparkling clean laundry. Its name has stood for quality and trust, making it, for example, Germany’s most trusted laundry detergent. The Persil product line has included many successful products since it was first introduced in the market back in 1907 and revolutionized the laundry process. The product combined sodium silicate with sodium perborate, which releases fine pearling oxygen when the laundry is boiled. The result is an especially textile-friendly and odorless bleach, in contrast to the chlorine used till then. It also reduces the strenuous and time-consuming rubbing, swinging, and scrubbing of laundry that had hitherto been the norm. The first self-acting detergent was born: Persil.  

Over its history, Henkel has wielded a leader’s influence through different brands and technology, enabling people to live easier and better lives. The company has managed to successfully capitalize on its customer-driven “glocal” marketing strategy, blending global understanding with local implementation, as in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The other member states are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Each of these countries has very different needs based on its culture. Saudi Arabia offers an
