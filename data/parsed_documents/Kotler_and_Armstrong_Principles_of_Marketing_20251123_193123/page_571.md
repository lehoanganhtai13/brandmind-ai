This table outlines a six-stage decision process for global marketing. It begins with an initial assessment of the global marketing environment, followed by a strategic decision on whether to pursue global expansion. Subsequently, the process involves identifying and selecting specific foreign markets for entry. Once target markets are chosen, the next step is to determine the most appropriate mode of market entry. This is followed by the development of the global marketing program, encompassing product, price, place, and promotion strategies tailored for international markets. The final stage involves establishing the global marketing organization, defining its structure and operational framework to manage international marketing activities effectively. This structured approach guides businesses through the complexities of international market engagement.

For example, Coca-Cola markets its products in hundreds of countries around the globe. It must understand the varying trade, economic, cultural, and political environments in each market.

# Elements of the Global Marketing Environment

That environment has changed a great deal in recent decades, creating both new opportunities and new problems.

## The International Trade System

U.S. companies looking abroad must start by understanding the international *trade system*. When selling to another country, a firm may face restrictions on trade between nations. Governments may charge *tariffs* or *duties*, taxes on certain imported products designed to raise revenue or protect domestic firms. Tariffs and duties are often used to force favorable trade behaviors from other nations.

For example, the European Union (EU) recently placed import duties on Chinese solar panels after determining that Chinese companies were selling the panels in EU countries at under-market prices. To retaliate, the very next day, the Chinese government placed duties on EU wine exports to China. The duties targeted the wines of Spain, France, and Italy but spared Germany, which had taken China’s side in the solar panel dispute. The disputes were resolved when Chinese solar panel producers agreed to a minimum price in Europe and Europe agreed to help China develop its own wine industry in return for promoting European wines there.⁶

Countries may set *quotas*, limits on the amount of foreign imports that they will accept in certain product categories. The purpose of a quota is to conserve on foreign exchange and protect local industry and employment. Firms may also encounter *exchange controls*, which limit the amount of foreign exchange and the exchange rate against other currencies.

A company also may face *nontariff trade barriers*, such as biases against its bids, restrictive product standards, or excessive host-country regulations or enforcement.  
For example, Walmart recently scaled down its once-ambitious plans to expand into India’s huge but fragmented retail market by opening hundreds of Walmart superstores there. Beyond difficult market conditions, such as spotty electricity and poor roads, India is notorious for throwing up nontariff obstacles to protect the nation’s own predominately mom-and-pop retailers, which control 96 percent of India’s $500 billion in retail sales. One such obstacle is a government regulation requiring foreign retailers in India to buy 30 percent of the merchandise they sell from local small businesses. Such a requirement is nearly impossible for
