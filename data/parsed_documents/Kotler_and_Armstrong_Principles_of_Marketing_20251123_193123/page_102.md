# Chapter 3 | Analyzing the Marketing Environment

workforce in 1970 to 47 percent of the workforce today. American women now make up 40 percent of primary family breadwinners in households with children under 18. Among households made up of married couples with children, 60 percent are dual-income households; only the husband works in 27 percent. Meanwhile, more men also stay home with their children and manage the household while their wives go to work.¹

Companies are now adapting their marketing to reflect the changing dynamics of American families. For example, whereas fathers were once ignored or portrayed as dolts in family-oriented ads, today’s advertisers are showing more caring and capable dads. One recent Samsung Galaxy phone ad, for instance, features a dad swaddling and calming his newborn son while Mom runs errands. When the anxious mom calls home to check in, the newly minted swaddle master replies, “We’re having a dudes’ day here. We’re fiiiiine. You take the *weekend* if you want to.”

Other ads reflect the evolving diversity in modern American households. For example, Campbell Soup’s recent “Your Father” commercial—part of the brand’s “Made for Real. Real Life” campaign—features a real-life same-sex couple feeding their son Campbell’s Star Wars soup as they mimic Darth Vader’s famous Star Wars line “I am your father.” The commercial, like others in the campaign, aligns the brand with the company’s purpose: “Real food that matters for real life moments.” Similarly, General Mills ran a series of commercials for Cheerios featuring an interracial couple and their daughter portraying typical young family scenarios—from the daughter pouring Cheerios on her sleeping dad’s chest after learning that Cheerios are good for your heart to her negotiating for a new puppy after learning that she is going to have a baby brother. Said a General Mills marketer, “At Cheerios, we know there are many kinds of families and we celebrate them all.”²

## Geographic Shifts in Population

This is a period of great migratory movements between and within countries. Americans, for example, are a mobile people, with about 12 percent of all U.S. residents moving each year. Over the past two decades, the U.S. population has shifted toward the Sunbelt states. The West and South have grown, whereas the Midwest and Northeast states have lost population.³ Such population shifts interest marketers because people in different regions buy differently. For example, people in the Midwest buy more winter clothing than people in the Southeast.

Also, for more than a century, Americans have been moving from rural to metropolitan areas. In the 1950s, they made a massive exit from the cities to the suburbs. Today, the migration to the suburbs continues. And more and more Americans are moving to “micropolitan areas,” small cities located beyond congested metropolitan areas, such as Minot, North Dakota; Boone, North Carolina; Traverse City, Michigan; and Concord, New Hampshire. These smaller micros offer many of the advantages of metro areas—jobs, restaurants, diversions, community organizations—but without the population crush, traffic jams, high crime rates, and high property taxes often associated with heavily urbanized areas. Ten percent of the U.S. population now resides in micropolitan areas.⁴

The shift in where people live has also caused a shift in where they work. For example, the migration toward micropolitan and suburban areas has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of people who “telecommute”—work at home or in a remote office and conduct business by phone or the internet. This trend, in turn, has created a booming SOHO (small office/home office) market. Increasing numbers of people are working from home with the help of electronic conveniences such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, and broadband internet access. One recent study estimates that 37 percent of employed individuals do some or all of their work at home.⁵

Many marketers are actively courting the lucrative telecommuting market. For example, online applications such as Citrix’s GoToMeeting, Sqwiggle, and Cisco’s WebEx help connect people who telecommute or work remotely. With such applications, people can meet and collaborate online via computer, tablet, or smartphone, no matter what their work location.
