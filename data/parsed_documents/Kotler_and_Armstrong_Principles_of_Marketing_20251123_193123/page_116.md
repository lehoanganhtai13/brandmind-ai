and stage media events to gain favorable press coverage. They take to the social media and run blogs to shape public opinion. They press lawsuits and file complaints with regulators to keep competitors in line, and they form contractual agreements to better control their distribution channels.

By taking action, companies can often overcome seemingly uncontrollable environmental events. For example, whereas some companies try to hush up negative talk about their products, others proactively counter false information. McDonald’s did this when a photo went viral showing unappetizing “mechanically separated chicken” (also known as “pink goop”) and associating it with the company’s Chicken McNuggets:52

> McDonald’s quickly issued statements disclaiming the pink goop photo as a hoax and noting that McNuggets are made using only boneless white breast meat chicken in a process that never produces anything remotely resembling the weird pink substance. But McDonald’s took its response an important step further. It created its own nearly three-minute social media video giving a tour of a company processing plant in Canada, showing the step-by-step process by which McNuggets are made. In the process, fresh chicken breasts are ground and seasoned, stamped into four nugget shapes (balls, bells, boots, and bow ties), battered, flash-fried, frozen, packaged, and shipped out to local McDonald’s restaurants where they are fully cooked. There’s not a trace of the gross pink goop anywhere in the process. The proactive video itself went viral, garnering more than 3.5 million YouTube views in less than six weeks. As a follow-up, McDonald’s launched an “Our Food. Your Questions.” campaign inviting consumers to submit questions about its food-making processes via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media. It then addressed the top concerns in a series of “behind-the-scenes” webisodes.

Marketing management cannot always control environmental forces. In many cases, it must settle for simply watching and reacting to the environment. For example, a company would have little success trying to influence geographic population shifts, the economic environment, or major cultural values. But whenever possible, smart marketing managers take a *proactive* rather than *reactive* approach to the marketing environment (see Real Marketing 3.2).

## 3.2 In the Social Media Age: When the Dialogue Gets Nasty

Marketers have hailed the internet and social media as the great new way to engage customers and nurture customer relationships. In turn, today’s more-empowered consumers use the new digital media to share their brand experiences with companies and with each other. All of this back and forth helps both the company and its customers. But sometimes, the dialogue can get nasty. Consider the following examples:

* Upon receiving a severely damaged computer monitor via FedEx, YouTube user goobie55 posts footage from his security camera. The video clearly shows a FedEx delivery man hoisting the monitor package over his head and tossing it over goobie55’s front gate without ever attempting to ring the bell, open the gate, or walk the package to the door. The video—with FedEx’s familiar purple and orange logo prominently displayed on everything from the driver’s shirt to the package and the truck—goes viral, with 5 million hits in just five days. TV news and talk shows go crazy discussing the clip.

* A young creative team at Ford’s ad agency in India produces a Ford Figo print ad and releases it to the internet without approval. The ad features three women—bound, gagged, and scantily clad—in the hatch of a Figo, with a caricature of a grinning Silvio Berlusconi (Italy’s sex-scandal-plagued ex-prime minister) at the wheel. The ad’s tagline: “Leave your worries behind with Figo’s extra-large boot (trunk).” Ford quickly pulls the ad, but not before it goes viral. Within days, millions of people around the world have viewed the ad, causing an online uproar and giving Ford a global black eye.

* When eight-year-old Harry Winsor sends a crayon drawing of an airplane he’s designed to Boeing with a suggestion that the company might want to manufacture it, the company responds with a stern, legal-form letter. “We do not accept unsolicited ideas,” the letter states. “We regret to inform you that we have disposed of your message and retain no copies.” The embarrassing blunder would probably go unnoticed were it not for the fact that Harry’s father—John Winsor, a prominent ad exec—blogs and tweets about the incident, making it instant national news.

Extreme events? Not anymore. The internet and social media have turned the traditional power relationship between businesses and consumers upside down. In the good old days, disgruntled consumers could do little more than bellow at a company service rep or shout out their complaints from a street corner. Now, armed with only a laptop or smartphone, they can take it public, airing their gripes to millions on blogs, social media sites, or even hate sites devoted exclusively to their least favorite corporations. “A consumer’s megaphone is now [sometimes] more powerful than a brand’s,” says one ad agency executive. “Individuals can bring a huge company to its knees … simply by sharing their experiences and opinions on Facebook, Yelp, Twitter, Instagram, or other social forums.”
