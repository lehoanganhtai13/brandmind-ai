# Innovative Marketing

The principle of **innovative marketing** requires that the company continuously seek real product and marketing improvements. The company that overlooks new and better ways to do things will eventually lose customers to another company that has found a better way.

Innovative marketers never stop looking for new and better ways to create customer value. For example, fast and dependable delivery is highly important to online shoppers. So Amazon delighted customers by being the first to innovate with free shipping on orders over $50. But Amazon didn’t stop there. It next introduced Amazon Prime, by which customers could receive their packages within only two days for no extra charge or in one day for a small additional fee. Still not satisfied, Amazon innovated with Amazon Prime Now, which offers super-fast same-day delivery—or even one-hour delivery—on tens of thousands of items in major metropolitan areas. In its never-ending quest to shorten delivery times, Amazon has even invested heavily in research on drones, driverless vehicles, and robots. This and a seemingly endless list of other innovations over the years—from Recommendations for You, Customer Reviews, and 1-Click Ordering features to the Amazon Marketplace, Kindle e-readers, and Amazon Cloud services—have helped Amazon to enhance the shopping customer experience and dominate online retailing.

# Sense-of-Mission Marketing

**Sense-of-mission marketing** means that the company should define its mission in broad *social* terms rather than narrow *product* terms. When a company defines a social mission, employees feel better about their work and have a clearer sense of direction. Brands linked with broader missions can serve the best long-run interests of both the brand and consumers.

For example, successful home furnishings retailer IKEA has a deeply ingrained sense of mission—called The IKEA Way—to create a better everyday life for people by “offering well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.” Johnson & Johnson’s flagship Johnson’s Baby brand dedicates itself to a mission of understanding babies and the special nurturing they require, then uses that knowledge to provide parents with safe and effective baby-care products. The company’s recently launched “Our Promise” advertising and social media campaign—which will include some 40 videos featuring and shared by Johnson’s Baby brand employees—assures parents that “It’s a responsibility we take seriously as we continue to apply our knowledge and research to bring you safe, innovative products that live up to our pure, mild, and gentle promise.” The first “Our Promise” video states that “We are moms and dads just like you. We’ll always listen and be here for you. Promise.” Sense-of-mission marketing has made Johnson’s Baby the world’s leading baby-care brand, with a nearly 25 percent worldwide market share.

Some companies define their overall corporate missions in broad societal terms. For example, under its buy-one-give-one model, shoe maker TOMS seeks both profits and to make the world a better place. Thus, at TOMS, “doing good” and “doing well” go hand in hand. To achieve its social-change mission, TOMS has to make money. At the same time, the brand’s social mission gives customers a powerful reason to buy.

However, having a *double bottom line* of values and profits isn’t easy. Over the years, brands such as Ben & Jerry’s, Timberland, The Body Shop, and Burt’s Bees—all known and respected for putting “principles before profits”—have at times struggled with less-than-stellar financial returns. In recent years, however, a new generation of social entrepreneurs has emerged, well-trained business managers who know that to *do good*, they must first *do well* in terms of profitable business operations.

Moreover, today, socially responsible business is no longer the sole province of small, socially conscious entrepreneurs. Many large, established companies and brands—from Walmart and Nike to Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and CVS Health—have A company should make marketing decisions by considering consumers’ wants, the company’s requirements, consumers’ long-run interests, and society’s long-run interests.
