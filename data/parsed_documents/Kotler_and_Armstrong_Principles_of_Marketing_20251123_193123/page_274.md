# OBJECTIVE 8-2 Describe the decisions companies make regarding their individual products and services, product lines, and product mixes. _(pp 249–257)_

Individual product decisions involve product attributes, branding, packaging, labeling, and product support services. **Product attribute** decisions involve product quality, features, and style and design. **Branding** decisions include selecting a brand name and developing a brand strategy. **Packaging** provides many key benefits, such as protection, economy, convenience, and promotion. Package decisions often include designing *labels and logos*, which identify, describe, and possibly promote the product. Companies also develop **product support services** that enhance customer service and satisfaction and safeguard against competitors.

Most companies produce a product line rather than a single product. A **product line** is a group of products that are related in function, customer-purchase needs, or distribution channels. All product lines and items offered to customers by a particular seller make up the **product mix**. The mix can be described by four dimensions: width, length, depth, and consistency. These dimensions are the tools for developing the company’s product strategy.

# OBJECTIVE 8-3 Identify the four characteristics that affect the marketing of services and the additional marketing considerations that services require. _(pp 258–264)_

Services are characterized by four key aspects: they are *intangible*, *inseparable*, *variable*, and *perishable*. Each characteristic poses problems and marketing requirements. Marketers work to find ways to make the service more tangible, increase the productivity of providers who are inseparable from their products, standardize quality in the face of variability, and improve demand movements and supply capacities in the face of service perishability.

Good service companies focus attention on **both** customers and employees. They understand the **service profit chain**, which links service firm profits with employee and customer satisfaction. Services marketing strategy calls not only for external marketing but also for **internal marketing** to motivate employees and **interactive marketing** to create service delivery skills among service providers. To succeed, service marketers must create *competitive differentiation*, offer high *service quality*, and find ways to increase *service productivity*.

# OBJECTIVE 8-4 Discuss branding strategy — the decisions companies make in building and managing their brands. _(pp 264–272)_

Some analysts see brands as *the* major enduring asset of a company. Brands are more than just names and symbols; they embody everything that the product or the service *means* to consumers. **Brand equity** is the positive differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer response to the product or the service. A brand with strong brand equity is a very valuable asset.

In building brands, companies need to make decisions about brand positioning, brand name selection, brand sponsorship, and brand development. The most powerful **brand positioning** builds around strong consumer beliefs and values. **Brand name selection** involves finding the best brand name based on a careful review of product benefits, the target market, and proposed marketing strategies. A manufacturer has four **brand sponsorship** options: It can launch a *national brand* (or manufacturer’s brand), sell to resellers that use a *private brand*, market *licensed brands*, or join forces with another company to *co-brand* a product. A company also has four choices when it comes to developing brands. It can introduce **line extensions**, **brand extensions**, **multibrands**, or **new brands**.

Companies must build and manage their brands carefully. The brand’s positioning must be continuously communicated to consumers. Advertising can help. However, brands are not maintained by advertising but by customers’ **brand experiences**. Customers come to know a brand through a wide range of contacts and interactions. The company must put as much care into managing these touch points as it does into producing its ads. Companies must periodically audit their brands’ strengths and weaknesses.
