At the same time, tickets for the final match of the sports competition were being offered at around $7,000 each. Although there is no suggestion that StubHub or Viagogo, the two resale sites in this case, had done anything illegal in hosting a third-party sale, it does illustrate the fact that within minutes of an event’s tickets being available online, they are sold out. In many cases, tickets are being offered even before the tickets are officially on sale, and at inflated prices. The ticket resellers need to be fairly confident that they can secure the tickets. This is usually done with the help of specially programmed software that they use to ensure their ticket orders get to the front of the queue, making a huge profit for them.

## Marketing Ethics  The Cost of a Life

When loved ones are critically ill, what are families willing to pay to keep them on a path to improved health? In 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals found itself in the middle of a controversial issue when it purchased an existing drug—Daraprim—from another pharmaceutical company. Daraprim has been around for 62 years and is used to treat life-threatening parasitic infections in AIDS and cancer patients. After acquiring Daraprim, Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli quickly raised its price from the previous $13.50 per pill to a whopping $750 per pill. According to CNN Money, CEO Shkreli stated, “We needed to turn a profit on this drug.” He added the company would use the profits to research better ways to treat diseases.

**10-11** Research the Daraprim pricing issue. Is it wrong for Turing Pharmaceuticals to charge such a high price for this medication? Support your position. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning)

**10-12** According to one *Harvard Business Review* article (see www.hbr.org/2015/09/its-time-to-rein-in-exorbitant-pharmaceutical-prices), over the past five years returns for the S&P Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index have been virtually doubled those of the broader S&P 500 (roughly 24 percent versus 12 percent annually). What factors affect profitability in the pharmaceutical industry? Are these high profit levels a good or bad thing? Explain.

## Marketing by the Numbers  Pricey Sheets

Many luxury sheets cost less than $200 to make but sell for more than $500 in retail stores. Some cost even more—consumers pay almost $3,000 for Frett’e “Tangeri Pizzo” kingsize luxury linens. The creators of a new brand of luxury linens, called Boll & Branch, have entered this market and are determining the price at which to sell their sheets directly to consumers online. They want to price their sheets lower than most brands but still want to earn an adequate margin on sales. The sheets come in a luxurious box that can be reused to store lingerie, jewelry, or other keepsakes. The Boll & Branch brand touts fair-trade practices when sourcing its high-grade long-staple organic cotton from India. Given the cost information below, refer to Appendix 2: Marketing by the Numbers to answer the following questions.

This data outlines the cost breakdown for a King-Size Set, presenting a process-based structure of expenses from raw materials to customer delivery. The initial stage involves the cost of raw cotton at $28.00, followed by manufacturing processes including spinning, weaving, dyeing ($12.00), and cut, sew, and finishing ($10.00). Subsequent costs cover logistics such as material transportation ($3.00), factory fees ($16.00), and inspection/import fees ($14.00). Further transportation and handling expenses include ocean freight and insurance ($5.00), warehousing ($8.00), and packaging ($15.00). The final stages involve marketing and distribution, with promotion costs at $30.00 and customer shipping at $15.00, culminating the cost accumulation for the product.

**10-13** Given the cost per king-size sheet set above and assuming the manufacturer has total fixed costs of $500,000 and estimates first year sales will be 50,000 sets, determine the price to consumers if the company desires a 40 percent margin on sales. (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

**10-14** If the company decides to sell through retailers instead of directly to consumers online, to maintain the consumer price you calculated in the previous question, at what price must it sell the product to a wholesaler who then sells it to retailers? Assume wholesalers desire a 10 percent margin and retailers get a 20 percent margin, both based on their respective selling prices. (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning) Fast-food chains are locked in a fierce battle that has them practically giving food away.
