# The New Product Development Process

Rather than leaving new products to chance, a company must carry out strong new product planning and set up a systematic, customer-driven *new product development process* for finding and growing new products. **Figure 9.1** shows the eight major steps in this process.

## Idea Generation

New product development starts with **idea generation**—the systematic search for new product ideas. A company typically generates hundreds—even thousands—of ideas to find a few good ones. Major sources of new product ideas include internal sources and external sources such as customers, competitors, distributors and suppliers, and others.

### Internal Idea Sources

Using *internal sources*, the company can find new ideas through formal R&D. For example, Ford operates an innovation and mobility center in Silicon Valley staffed by engineers, app developers, and scientists working on everything from driverless cars to Works with Nest apps that let consumers control home heating, lighting, and appliances from their vehicles. Chick-fil-A set up a large innovation center called Hatch, where its staff and partners explore new ideas in food, design, and service. Hatch is a place to “ideate, explore, and imagine the future,” to hatch new food and restaurant ideas and bring them to life.⁴

Beyond its internal R&D process, a company can pick the brains of its own people—from executives to salespeople to scientists, engineers, and manufacturing staff. Many companies have developed successful internal social networks and *intrapreneurial* programs that encourage employees to develop new product ideas. For example, AT&T has set up an internal online innovation community called The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), through which AT&T employees from all areas and levels of the company submit, discuss, and vote on new product and service ideas. Each quarter, the “founders” of top vote-getting ideas pitch them to AT&T senior executives, who select the best three for further funding and development. Since its inception in 2009, AT&T employees have submitted more than 28,000 ideas to the TIP community, and the company has funded more than 75 TIP projects ranging from customer service enhancements to new product offerings.⁵

Tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter sponsor periodic “hackathons,” in which employees take a day or a week away from their day-to-day work to develop new ideas. LinkedIn, the 300 million–member professional social media network, holds “hackdays,” one Friday each month when it encourages employees to work on whatever

This table outlines a sequential process for new product development, beginning with **Idea generation** and progressing through several distinct stages. Following idea generation, **Idea screening** serves to filter and select promising concepts. The selected ideas then move to **Concept development and testing**, where they are refined and evaluated with potential customers. Subsequently, **Marketing strategy development** focuses on planning how to bring the product to market. The process continues with **Business analysis**, which assesses the financial viability of the product. This leads to **Product development**, the actual creation of the product. **Test marketing** then involves a trial launch in a limited market to gauge consumer response and refine the strategy. Finally, the process culminates in **Commercialization**, the full-scale introduction of the product to the market. The structure is linear and progressive, with each stage building upon the outcomes of the previous one.
