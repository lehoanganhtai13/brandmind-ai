# Sustainable Marketing: Social Responsibility and Ethics

These goals span the entire value chain, from how the company sources raw materials to how consumers use and dispose of its products. “Our aim is to make our activities more sustainable and also encourage our customers, suppliers, and others to do the same,” says the company.

On the “upstream supply side,” more than half of Unilever’s raw materials come from agriculture, so the company is helping suppliers develop sustainable farming practices that meet its own high expectations for environmental and social impact. Unilever assesses suppliers against two sets of standards. The first is the Unilever Supplier Code, which calls for socially responsible actions regarding human rights, labor practices, product safety, and care for the environment. Second, specifically for agricultural suppliers, the Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code details Unilever’s expectations for sustainable agriculture practices so that it and its suppliers “can commit to the sustainability journey together.”

But Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan goes far beyond simply creating more responsible supply and distribution chains. Approximately 68 percent of the total greenhouse gas footprint of Unilever’s products and 50 percent of the water footprint occur during consumer use. So Unilever is also working with its customers to improve the environmental impact of its products in use. About 2 billion people in 190 markets worldwide use a Unilever product on any given day. Therefore, small everyday consumer actions can add up to a big difference. Unilever sums it up with this equation: 

$$\text{Unilever brands} \times \text{small everyday actions} \times \text{billions of consumers} = \text{big difference}.$$

For example, almost one-third of households worldwide use Unilever laundry products to do their washing—approximately 125 billion washes every year. Therefore, under its Sustainable Living Plan, Unilever is both creating more eco-friendly laundry products and motivating consumers to improve their laundry habits.

Around the world, for instance, Unilever is encouraging consumers to wash clothes at lower temperatures and use the correct dosage of detergent. Unilever products such as OMO and Persil Small & Mighty concentrated laundry detergents use less packaging, making them cheaper and less polluting to transport. More important, they’ve been reformulated to wash efficiently at lower temperatures, using less energy and water. Unilever estimates that these changes have achieved a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Another Unilever product, Comfort One Rinse fabric conditioner, was created for hand-washing clothes in developing and emerging markets where water is often in short supply. The innovative product requires only one bucket of water for rinsing rather than three, saving consumers time, effort, and 30 liters of water per wash.

Such energy and water savings don’t show up on Unilever’s income statement, but they will be extremely important to the people and the planet. “Ultimately,” says the company, “we will only succeed if we inspire people around the world to take small, everyday actions that can add up to a big difference for the world.” To meet this objective, Unilever has identified “Five Levers for Change”—things that its marketers can do to inspire people to adopt specific sustainable behaviors. The model helps marketers identify the barriers and triggers for change. The levers for change are: make it understood, make it easy, make it desirable, make it rewarding, and make it a habit.

Will Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan produce results for the company? So far, so good. Unilever is making excellent progress on its overall mission of “making sustainable living commonplace” and on its 79 aggressive Sustainable Living Plan goals. The company has already achieved 13 specific targets, is right on pace with 57 more, and is making good progress on the other nine. And despite volatility in its global markets, Unilever’s profits continue to grow.

The sustainability plan is not just the right thing to do for people and the environment, claims Polman, it’s also right for Unilever. The quest for sustainability saves money by reducing energy use and minimizing waste. It fuels innovation, resulting in new products and new consumer benefits. And it creates new market opportunities: More than half of Unilever’s sales are from developing countries, the very places that face the greatest sustainability challenges.
