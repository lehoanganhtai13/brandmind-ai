that parents can once again love. ● One 30-second TV ad shows variations on a familiar family scene—a young child asking a parent to do something again—“Do it again! Again!” It finishes with a father throwing a handful of Trix in the air and catching the cereal in his mouth as his daughter enthusiastically urges him to do it again. The extensive “Love Cereal Again” campaign, wrapped in the nostalgia of childhood breakfast, uses a broad range of traditional, digital, mobile, social, and in-store media to quickly create awareness and knowledge across the entire market.⁸

Assuming that target consumers *know* about a product, how do they *feel* about it? Almost all American consumers know about Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and other BigG cereals. These brands have been around since the late 1950s. General Mills wants to move buyers through successively stronger stages of feelings toward the revamped cereals. These stages include *liking* (feeling favorable about BigG cereals), *preference* (preferring the BigG cereals to competing brands), and *conviction* (believing that BigG cereals are the best cereals for them).

General Mills marketers use a combination of promotion mix tools to create positive feelings and conviction. Initial TV commercials help build anticipation and an emotional brand connection. Images, text, and videos on General Mills’ social media sites engage, entertain, and educate potential buyers on the reformulation of the cereal products. Press releases and other PR activities help keep the buzz going about the products. A packed microsite (www.generalmills.com/cereal) provides additional information and buying opportunities.

Finally, some members of the target market might be convinced about the product but not quite get around to making the *purchase*. The communicator must lead these consumers to take the final step. To help reluctant consumers over such hurdles, General Mills might offer buyers special promotional prices (coupons, in-store discounts, and special offers) and support the product with comments and reviews from customers at its web and social media sites and elsewhere.

Of course, marketing communications alone cannot create positive feelings and purchases for BigG cereals. The cereal itself must provide superior value for customers. In fact, outstanding marketing communications can actually speed the demise of a poor product. The more quickly potential buyers learn about a poor product, the more quickly they become aware of its faults. Thus, good marketing communications call for “good deeds followed by good words.” For example, to ensure that the healthier versions of its old BigG favorites would succeed, before introducing the reformulated versions, General Mills researched 69 colors and 86 flavors, did 98 consumer tastings, completed 301 recipe experiments, and spent 140 hours listening to customers about the products.

## Designing a Message

Having defined the desired audience response, the communicator then turns to developing an effective message. Ideally, the message should get *attention*, hold *interest*, arouse *desire*, and obtain *action* (a framework known as the *AIDA model*). In practice, few messages take the consumer *all* the way from awareness to purchase, but the AIDA framework suggests the desirable qualities of a good message.

When putting a message together, the marketing communicator must decide what to say (*message content*) and how to say it (*message structure* and *format*).

**Message Content.** The marketer has to figure out an appeal or theme that will produce the desired response. There are three types of appeals: rational, emotional, and moral. *Rational appeals* relate to the audience’s self-interest. They show that the product will produce the desired benefits.
