However, such captive-product costs might make others avoid buying the device in the first place or cause discomfort during use after purchase.  
In the case of services, captive-product pricing is called *two-part pricing*. The price of the service is broken into a *fixed fee* plus a *variable usage rate*. Thus, at Six Flags and other amusement parks, you pay a daily ticket or season pass charge plus additional fees for food and other in-park features.

## By-Product Pricing  
Producing products and services often generates by-products. If the by-products have no value and if getting rid of them is costly, this will affect the pricing of the main product. Using **by-product pricing**, the company seeks a market for these by-products to help offset the costs of disposing of them and help make the price of the main product more competitive.  
The by-products themselves can even turn out to be profitable—turning trash into cash. For example, cheese makers in Wisconsin have discovered a use for their leftover brine, a salt solution used in the cheese-making process. Instead of paying to have it disposed of, they now sell it to local city and county highway departments, which use it in conjunction with salt to melt icy roads. It doesn’t stop there. In New Jersey, pickle makers sell their leftover brine for similar uses. In Tennessee, distilleries sell off potato juice, a by-product of vodka distillation. And on many highways across the nation, highway crews use a product called Beet Heet, which is made from—you guessed it—beet juice brine by-products. The only side effect of these brine solutions is a slight odor. Says one highway department official about cheese brine, “If you were behind a snow plow, you’d immediately smell it.”[^7]

## Product Bundle Pricing  
Using **product bundle pricing**, sellers often combine several products and offer the bundle at a reduced price. For example, fast-food restaurants bundle a burger, fries, and a soft drink at a “combo” price. Microsoft Office is sold as a bundle of computer software, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. And Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and other telecommunications companies bundle TV service, phone service, and high-speed internet connections at a low combined price. Price bundling can promote the sales of products consumers might not otherwise buy, but the combined price must be low enough to get them to buy the bundle.

# Price Adjustment Strategies  
Companies usually adjust their basic prices to account for various customer differences and changing situations. Here we examine the seven price adjustment strategies summarized in **Table 11.2**: *discount and allowance pricing, segmented pricing, psychological pricing, promotional pricing, geographical pricing, dynamic pricing,* and *international pricing*.

## Discount and Allowance Pricing  
Most companies adjust their basic price to reward customers for certain responses, such as paying bills early, volume purchases, and off-season buying. These price adjustments—called *discounts* and *allowances*—can take many forms.  
One form of **discount** is a *cash discount*, a price reduction to buyers who pay their bills promptly. A typical example is “2/10, net 30,” which means that although payment is due within 30 days, the buyer can deduct 2 percent if the bill is paid within 10 days. A *quantity discount* is a price reduction to buyers who buy large volumes. A seller offers a *functional discount* (also called a *trade discount*) to trade-channel members who perform certain functions, such as selling, storing, and record keeping. A *seasonal discount* is a price reduction to buyers who buy merchandise or services out of season.

> **Discount**  
> A straight reduction in price on purchases during a stated period of time or of larger quantities.
