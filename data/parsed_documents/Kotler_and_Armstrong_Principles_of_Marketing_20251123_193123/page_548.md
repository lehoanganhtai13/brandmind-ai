# Creating Competitive Advantage

Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and T-Mobile have aggressively attacked each other in comparative ads:

Verizon started the most recent round of attacks with TV ads using colorful balls to illustrate its supposed network dominance over specifically named competitors. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint responded with vigorous counterattacks debunking Verizon’s claims. For example, T-Mobile launched a #BallBusterChallenge campaign inviting consumers and media to make side-by-side comparisons of T-Mobile’s full network against Verizon’s, claiming that its LTE network is not just the nation’s fastest, it’s also the nation’s fastest growing. The challenge traveled across the country, urging Verizon users to match T-Mobile’s network head-on, testing data speeds, texting, and calls. If a customer’s Verizon network beat out T-Mobile’s two out of three times, the customer received $100.  
When customers lost, they posed for a photo with sign such as “T-Mobile’s network was just as good as Verizon’s #BallBusterChallenge” or “Verizon’s network just got spanked by T-Mobile #BallBusterChallenge.” At the same time, T-Mobile ran its own “balls” ad on the Super Bowl correcting Verizon’s dated facts, complete with a #Ballogize hashtag.

In some cases, such competitive exchanges can provide useful information to consumers and advantages for brands. In other cases, they can reflect unfavorably on the entire industry.

## Selecting Competitors to Attack and Avoid

A company has already largely selected its major competitors through prior decisions on customer targets, positioning, and its marketing mix strategy. Management now must decide which competitors to compete against most vigorously.

### Strong or Weak Competitors

A company can focus on one of several classes of competitors. Most companies prefer to compete against weak competitors. This requires fewer resources and less time. But in the process, the firm may gain little. You could argue that a firm also should compete with strong competitors to sharpen its abilities. And sometimes, a company can’t avoid its largest competitors, as in the case of T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. But even strong competitors have some weaknesses, and succeeding against them often provides greater returns.

A useful tool for assessing competitor strengths and weaknesses is **customer value analysis**. The aim of customer value analysis is to determine the benefits that target customers value and how customers rate the relative value of various competitors’ offers. In conducting a customer value analysis, the company first identifies the major attributes that customers value and the importance customers place on these attributes. Next, it assesses its performance against competitors on those valued attributes.

The key to gaining competitive advantage is to examine how a company’s offer compares to that of its major competitors in each customer segment. The company wants to find the place in the market where it meets customers’ needs in a way rivals can’t. If the company’s offer delivers greater value than the competitor’s offer on important attributes, it can charge a higher price and earn higher profits, or it can charge the same price and gain more market share. But if the company is seen as performing at a lower level than its major competitors on some important attributes, it must invest in strengthening those attributes or finding other important attributes where it can build a lead.

### Good or Bad Competitors

A company really needs and benefits from competitors. The existence of competitors results in several strategic benefits. Competitors may share the costs of market and product development and help legitimize new technologies. They may serve less-attractive segments or lead to more product differentiation. Finally, competitors may help increase total demand.

For example, you might think that Apple’s introduction of its iPad tablet would have spelled trouble for Amazon’s smaller, dowdier Kindle e-reader, which had been on the market for three years prior to the iPad’s debut. Many analysts thought that Apple had created the “Kindle killer.” However, as it turns out, the competing iPad created a stunning surge in tablet demand that benefited both companies. Kindle e-reader sales increased sharply with the iPad introduction, and new tablet demand spurred Amazon to introduce its own full line of Kindle tablets. As an added bonus, the surge in iPad usage increased Amazon’s sales of e-books and other digital content, which can be read on the iPad using a free Kindle for iPad app.
