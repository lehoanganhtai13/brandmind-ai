# Video Case Sprout

In the world of children’s television programming, Sprout is a relative newcomer. Owned by NBCUniversal, Sprout airs PBS Kids programming as well as additional acquired material. A true multiplatform network, Sprout can be accessed as regular cable programming, as on-demand programming through Comcast, and online through Sproutonline.com.

Sprout does not target only kids, however. It targets preschool families—households that have one or more preschool-age children. Parents need to be involved with their children’s viewing of interactive content, multiple access points, and 24-hour programming. For this reason, Sprout’s promotional efforts are geared toward parents as well as children.

After viewing the video featuring Sprout, answer the following questions:

- **7-16** Why does Sprout target preschool families rather than focusing solely on children? Give examples.  
- **7-17** Which target marketing strategy best describes Sprout’s efforts? Support your choice.

# Company Case Virgin America: Flight Service for the Tech Savvy

After an exceptionally frustrating day at the office, Jessica set out to unwind in one of her favorite third places. The mood lighting immediately brought her blood pressure down as she walked in and took a deep, relaxing breath. She was happy that her favorite spot was available—a comfy leather chair in the back corner of the room, where she used the touchscreen at the table in front of her to order her favorite drink. Then, putting on a set of noise-canceling headphones, Jessica began catching up on her favorite TV show with her own personal entertainment portal.

If this sounds like a local Starbucks or trendy nightclub, think again. Jessica had just boarded a flight on Virgin America, one of the youngest airlines in the United States. It’s also the hottest airline, besting all competition in various industry and customer surveys. And after just six years in business, Virgin America also reached profitability faster than any other airline in all of airdom.

How does a startup airline break into one of the most competitive industries in the world, notorious for barriers to entry? For Virgin America, the answer is two-fold—by putting customers first and by targeting the right customer segment.

## Targeting the Right Customers

Virgin America first took to the skies in 2007. This wouldn’t be the first shot at starting an airline for Richard Branson—founder of parent company Virgin Group. Virgin’s international airline, Virgin Atlantic, had been crossing the pond between the United States and Europe since 1984. But Virgin America would be an entirely independent enterprise. And while Branson and other Virgin Group executives make no day-to-day decisions at Virgin America, the unorthodox Virgin culture—fun, creative, even whacky—is unmistakable.

One of Branson’s core values that permeates Virgin America is this: Take care of your people first and profits will follow. In an industry characterized by customer complaints about service, it would seem that a customer-centric approach would be enough to gain a foothold in the market. But when Virgin started air service in the United States, at least a few other airlines had already established themselves based on a “customer first” mantra, including industry leader Southwest Airlines. And Virgin America knew that it could not expect to succeed by playing the low-price game. Not only was Southwest the reigning champion on value, but the bulk of airline competitors were already beating each other up for low-price dominance.

Virgin America found a different competitive hook. It targeted a segment of frequent fliers who were young, savvy, influential, and willing to pay just a little bit more for an airline that would take care of them—the Silicon Valley faction. By providing exceptional service and amenities that appeal to this particular slice of airline customers, Virgin America has been able to charge slightly higher fares and still establish a growing base of fiercely loyal patrons.

## Homing in on the Details

Offering unique amenities in the airline business is a challenge for any company. But from the beginning, the Virgin America experience was designed with its target customer in mind. Its fleet consists of 61 Airbus A300 series planes, each brand new when it went into service, minimizing the unexpected delays due to maintenance and repairs. Custom-designed leather seats are roomier and more comfortable than average coach seating. And that mood lighting? Not only does it bathe the aircraft cabin in an appealing purplish glow, it automatically adjusts to one of 12 different shades based on outside light.

To appeal to tech gurus, Virgin America focused on equipping its planes with the latest hardware and software. From day one, Virgin was the only domestic carrier to offer fleetwide in-flight Wi-Fi—a distinction that it maintains to this day, even as it has stayed ahead of the competition by upgrading the network to
