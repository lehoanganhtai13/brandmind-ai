# 13 Retailing and Wholesaling

## CHAPTER PREVIEW

We now look more deeply into the two major intermediary marketing channel functions: retailing and wholesaling. You already know something about retailing—retailers of all shapes and sizes serve you every day, both in stores and online. However, you probably know much less about the hoard of wholesalers working behind the scenes. In this chapter, we examine the characteristics of different kinds of retailers and wholesalers, the marketing decisions they make, and trends for the future.

Fast Retailing, Asia’s top and the world’s fourth-largest apparel retailer, has revolutionized the retail clothing industry by creating and fostering innovative retail experiences. The company has turned UNIQLO, its key brand, into a global one by living up to its “Made for All” credo. The company has built long-term relationships with material manufacturers and cooperates with them to offer high-quality products at affordable prices. UNIQLO’s specific attention to customer service has further contributed to its global success.

## UNIQLO: The Innovative Route in Fashion Retailing

UNIQLO Co., Ltd. is a Japanese casual wear designer, manufacturer, and retailer. Since 2005, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Retailing Co., Ltd. UNIQLO Japan is the nation’s largest apparel retail chain, with a 6.5 percent market share of the Japanese apparel market and a network of 841 stores at the end of November 2016 generating annual net sales in 2015 (the year ending August 31) of over $6.6 billion. The company contributes more than 50 percent of the group’s net sales. From there, UNIQLO International has been driving group growth by opening new stores each year in various countries outside Japan. The company has more than 1,795 stores as of August 2016 worldwide, including Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom. UNIQLO International contributes about one-third to group sales. This makes Fast Retailing the latest global company from Japan and Asia’s top—as well as the world’s fourth-largest—apparel retailer, following Inditex (Zara), Hennes & Mauritz (H&M), and Gap.

Founded by President and CEO Tadashi Yanai, UNIQLO’s first store opened as a “unique clothing warehouse” selling unisex casual clothing in Hiroshima in 1984. It was later renamed Fast Retailing Co. in 1991. At this time, the company was simply reselling garments that it bought from other manufacturers, but a key turning point for the brand came about when it decided in 1997 to take on more elements of the value chain and begin producing its own clothes. This transformed UNIQLO from a suburban casual clothing store into a Japanese household name, and the company became Japan’s first specialty store retailer of private label apparel (known as an SPA). Ever since, the company has refined this business model, allowing sophisticated control of the entire business process, from planning and design to material procurement and sales. As a consequence, UNIQLO won the fiscal 2014 Retailer of the Year Award from the World Retail Congress for exceptional, world-class performance and has successfully developed into a global brand. Tadashi Yanai believes that this global development and growth is a testament to UNIQLO’s unique position as the world’s only “lifewear” brand, which means everyday clothes for a better life—high quality, fashionable, affordable, and comfortable.

How did Fast Retailing manage to turn UNIQLO into a global fashion retail brand? Steered by the philosophy “Made for All,” UNIQLO offers high-quality products at affordable prices; for example, a pair of jeans may be priced as low as $9. The UNIQLO Material Development Team is able to procure high-quality materials at low costs through direct relationships with and bulk purchases from material manufacturers globally.
