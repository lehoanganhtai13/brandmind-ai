In addition, the range has clear and easy-to-understand nutrition and allergy information on all packaging to help chefs understand what is in the products, and in turn inform their customers as necessary. For the product launch itself, select trade media such as *Catering Update*, *Caterer*, and *Hotelkeeper* carried advertising and promotional material. In addition, eight-page supplements were produced to communicate the new brand proposition, supported by direct mailing of informative literature to chefs and other users. Maggi also sponsors events for chefs that involve using Maggi—A Natural Choice products, such as the Nestlé Toque d’Or competition, in which teams have to battle against each other and the clock in a live cooking arena. This event has become the top event for the top talents in the United Kingdom. Maggi works closely with the main food services wholesalers and cash-and-carry operators, and supports them with promotional material about new products to coincide with the launch. This ensures that distribution of Maggi—A Natural Choice to caterers and chefs is effective and efficient.

Against the background of its customer-centered new product development, Nestlé continues to improve its range further and extend its approach to providing healthier food. For example, in 2012 the company substantially reduced the salt in its products to support a World Health Organization salt target of no more than 5 grams of salt per person, per day, by 2025. In 2013, the company announced its commitment to a new nutrition labeling scheme, the latest food pledge in the government’s Public Health Responsibility Deal. The new scheme, created by the Department of Health alongside health organizations, retailers, and manufacturers, aims to provide British shoppers with dependable nutrition labeling. The scheme combines Guideline Daily Amount information with an at-a-glance color coding system. The consistent system combines red, amber, and green color-coding and nutritional information to show how much fat, saturated fat, salt, sugar, and calories are in food products.

Nestlé’s work has yielded dividends. In April 2016, Nestlé ranked second in Oxfam’s Behind the Brands scorecard, in which the NGO ranks the world’s Top 10 consumer food and beverage companies on their policies and commitments to improve food security and sustainability. In all, Nestlé has succeeded in carrying out strong new product planning and setting up a systematic and customer-driven new product development process for finding and growing new market offerings.

2. *Introduction* is a period of slow sales growth as the product is introduced in the market. Profits are nonexistent in this stage because of the heavy expenses of product introduction.  
3. *Growth* is a period of rapid market acceptance and increasing profits.  
4. *Maturity* is a period of slowdown in sales growth because the product has achieved acceptance by most potential buyers. Profits level off or decline because of increased marketing outlays to defend the product against competition.  
5. *Decline* is the period when sales fall off and profits drop.

Not all products follow all five stages of the PLC. Some products are introduced and die quickly; others stay in the mature stage for a long, long time. Some enter the decline stage and are then cycled back into the growth stage through strong promotion or repositioning. It seems that a well-managed brand could live forever. Venerable brands like Coca-Cola, Gillette, Budweiser, Guinness, American Express, Wells Fargo, Heinz, Kikkoman, and TABASCO sauce, for instance, are still going strong after more than 100 years. Guinness beer has been around for more than 250 years,  
🔵 Life Savers Mints recently celebrated “100 years of keeping mouths feeling fresh,” and 147-year-old TABASCO sauce brags that it’s “over 140 years old and still able to totally whup your butt!”

The PLC concept can describe a *product class* (gasoline-powered automobiles), a *product form* (SUVs), or a *brand* (the Ford Escape). The PLC concept applies differently in each case. Product classes have the longest life cycles; the sales of many product classes stay in the mature stage for a long time. Product forms, in contrast, tend to have the standard PLC shape. Product forms such as dial telephones, VHS tapes, and film cameras passed through a regular history of introduction, rapid growth, maturity, and decline.

A specific brand’s life cycle can change quickly because of changing competitive attacks and responses. For example, although laundry soaps (product class) and powdered detergents (product form) have enjoyed fairly long life cycles, the life cycles of specific brands have tended to be much shorter.
