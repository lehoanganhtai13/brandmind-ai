# Managing Marketing Information to Gain Customer Insights

As a result, they usually garner higher response rates. The internet is an excellent medium for reaching the hard-to-reach consumer—for example, the often-elusive teen, single, affluent, and well-educated audiences. It’s also good for reaching people who lead busy lives, from working mothers to on-the-go executives. Such people are well represented online, and they can respond in their own space and at their own convenience.

Just as marketing researchers have rushed to use the internet for quantitative surveys and data collection, they are now also adopting *qualitative* internet-based research approaches, such as online focus groups, blogs, and social networks. The internet can provide a fast, low-cost way to gain qualitative customer insights.

A primary qualitative internet-based research approach is **online focus groups**. For example, online research firm FocusVision offers its InterVu service, which harnesses the power of the internet to conduct focus groups with participants at remote locations, anywhere in the world, at any time. Using their own webcams, InterVu participants can log on to focus sessions from their homes or offices and see, hear, and react to each other in real-time, face-to-face discussions. Such focus groups can be conducted in any language and viewed with simultaneous translation. They work well for bringing together people from different parts of the country or world at low cost. Researchers can view the sessions in real time from just about anywhere, eliminating travel, lodging, and facility costs. Finally, although online focus groups require some advance scheduling, results are almost immediate.

Although growing rapidly, both quantitative and qualitative internet-based research have some drawbacks. One major problem is controlling who’s in the online sample. Without seeing respondents, it’s difficult to know who they really are. To overcome such sample and context problems, many online research firms use opt-in communities and respondent panels.

Alternatively, many companies have now developed their own “insight communities” from which they obtain customer feedback and insights. For example, NASCAR has built an online community of 12,000 core fans called the NASCAR Fan Council from which it obtains quick and relevant feedback from fans. Similarly, women’s magazine *Allure* formed its own insight community—called Beauty Enthusiasts, now 35,000 members strong—from which it solicits feedback both on its own content and on advertisers’ brands. When Beauty Enthusiast members first join the community, they provide detailed information about their demographics, product needs, and preferences. Brands can then interact online with specific segments of the Beauty Enthusiasts community about brand perceptions, product ideas, beauty trends, and marketing moves. Says one analyst, “The feedback combines the precision of quantitative research with the qualitative results of focus groups, as people write their reactions to products in their own words.”

## Online Behavioral and Social Tracking and Targeting

Thus, in recent years, the internet has become an important tool for conducting research and developing customer insights. But today’s marketing researchers are going even further—well beyond online surveys, focus groups, and online communities. Increasingly, they are listening to and watching consumers by actively mining the rich veins of unsolicited, unstructured, “bottom-up” customer information already coursing around the internet. Whereas traditional marketing research provides more logical consumer responses to structured and intrusive research questions, online listening provides the passion and spontaneity of unsolicited consumer opinions.

Tracking consumers online might be as simple as scanning customer reviews and comments on the company’s brand site or on shopping sites such as Amazon.com or BestBuy.com. Or it might mean using sophisticated online-analysis tools to deeply analyze the mountains of consumer brand-related comments and messages found in blogs or on social media sites. Listening to and engaging customers online can provide valuable insights into what consumers are saying or feeling about a brand. It can also provide opportunities for building positive brand experiences and relationships. Many companies now excel at
