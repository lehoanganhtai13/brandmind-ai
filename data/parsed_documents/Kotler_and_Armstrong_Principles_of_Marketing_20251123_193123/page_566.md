Rather, Google is out to fortify its position as the online video leader based on its own strengths—and that means YouTube. Last year, YouTube launched its own paid subscription service, Red. For $9.99 a month, viewers receive ad-free access to all YouTube content across all YouTube interfaces. Subscribers can save videos and playlists on devices to be viewed offline. There is even a “music only” setting for music videos, integrating with YouTube Music and Google Play Music to make Red a commercial-free streaming music service.

Although such features are nice, YouTube Red’s biggest draw will likely be its recently launched Originals—original programming available exclusively to Red subscribers. But unlike Netflix, Amazon, and even Apple, YouTube is developing content with its own twist. First and foremost, it’s capitalizing on the personalities made famous at home. There’s *Scare PewDiePie*, a scripted reality horror show from the producers of *The Walking Dead* and starring YouTube’s biggest celebrity, Felix Kjellberg. There’s *A Trip to Unicorn Island*, a documentary focusing on Lilly “Superwoman” Singh. And there’s *Fight of the Living Dead*, which puts YouTube talent in a fight to survive a zombie apocalypse.

But even as YouTube signs its own celebrities to star in top-quality programs, it doesn’t have a lock on these stars. In a first-ever competitive move, Netflix recently signed YouTube sensation Miranda Sings to star in an original comedy series, *Haters Back Off!* Although YouTube has plenty of homegrown personalities to choose from, it must now add them to the list of possible competitive threats.

YouTube Red currently has 10 programs available. And with many more in the works, including more high-profile shows featuring high-profile industry talent, YouTube Originals is off and running. Offering very competitive compensation for personalities, directors, and producers, Hollywood insiders as well as Google’s competitors have gotten the message—YouTube means business.
