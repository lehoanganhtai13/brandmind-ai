# Forms of Direct and Digital Marketing

This table outlines direct marketing strategies, emphasizing the integration of both digital and traditional approaches for optimal impact. Digital and social media marketing encompasses online marketing activities such as websites, online advertising, email, online videos, and blogs, alongside social media marketing and mobile marketing. The overarching goal of these digital efforts is to build direct customer engagement and community. Complementing these are traditional direct marketing methods, which include face-to-face selling, direct-mail marketing, catalog marketing, telemarketing, direct-response TV marketing, and kiosk marketing. The structure highlights a dual-pronged strategy, leveraging the reach and interactivity of digital channels while retaining the established effectiveness of traditional direct marketing techniques.

As noted earlier, **digital and social media marketing** is the fastest-growing form of direct marketing. It uses digital marketing tools such as websites, online video, email, blogs, social media, mobile ads and apps, and other digital platforms to directly engage consumers anywhere, anytime via their computers, smartphones, tablets, internet-ready TVs, and other digital devices. The widespread use of the internet and digital technologies is having a dramatic impact on both buyers and the marketers who serve them.

> Direct digital and social media marketing is surging and grabbing all the headlines these days, so we’ll start with it. But the traditional direct marketing tools are still heavily used. We’ll dig into them later in the chapter.

## Marketing, the Internet, and the Digital Age

Much of the world’s business today is carried out over digital networks that connect people and companies. These days, people connect digitally with information, brands, and each other at almost any time and from almost anywhere. In the age of the “Internet of Things” (IoT), it seems that everything and everyone will soon be connected digitally to everything and everyone else. The digital age has fundamentally changed customers’ notions of convenience, speed, price, product information, service, and brand interactions. As a result, it has given marketers a whole new way to create customer value, engage customers, and build customer relationships.

Digital usage and impact continues to grow steadily. More than 87 percent of all U.S. adults use the internet, and the average U.S. internet user spends almost six hours a day using digital media, primarily via mobile devices. Worldwide, more than 46 percent of the population has internet access. And 30 percent has access to the mobile internet, a number that’s expected to double by 2020 as mobile becomes an ever-more-popular way to get online.⁵

As a result, more than half of all U.S. households now regularly shop online, and digital buying continues to grow at a healthy double-digit rate. U.S. online retail sales were an estimated $350 billion last year, about 7.1 percent of total retail sales. By 2020, as consumers continue to shift their spending from physical to digital stores, that number is expected to grow to more than $520 billion (8.9 percent of total retail sales). Perhaps even more important, it’s estimated that more than half of all U.S. retail sales were either transacted directly online or influenced by internet research.⁶ As today’s omni-channel consumers become more and more adept at blending online and in-store shopping, digital channels will come into play for an ever-larger proportion of their purchases.

To reach this burgeoning market, most companies now market online. Some companies operate *only* online. They include a wide array of firms, from *e-tailers* such as Amazon, Overstock.com, and Expedia.com that sell products and services directly to final buyers via the internet to *search engines and portals* (such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and DuckDuckGo), *transaction sites* (eBay, Craigslist), *content sites* (the *New York Times* on the web, ESPN.com, and *Encyclopædia Britannica*), and *online social media* (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat).

Today, however, it’s hard to find a company that doesn’t have a substantial online presence. Even companies that have traditionally operated offline have now created their own online sales, marketing, and brand community channels. Traditional store retailers are reaping increasingly larger proportions of their sales online. For example, Macy’s is now the world’s seventh-largest e-tailer, with almost 20 percent of its revenues coming from Creating a seamless cross-channel buying experience that integrates in-store, online, and mobile shopping.
