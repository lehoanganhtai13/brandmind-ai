# Creating Competitive Advantage

We might all still be capturing “Kodak moments” on Kodak digital cameras and smartphones and sharing them on social media and Kodak-run online sites.

As Kodak emerged from bankruptcy, it stopped making cameras and discontinued its famous Kodachrome color film. Instead, it now licenses its name to other manufacturers that will make cameras under the Kodak brand. Almost all of its revenues now come from commercial imaging and printing products and services for business customers in graphic arts, commercial print, publishing, packaging, electronic displays, and entertainment and commercial films. So, along with Kodak’s illustrious fortunes, it looks as though the famed “Kodak moment” has now passed into history.

into consumer products through licensing partnerships with companies ranging from Pillsbury and Green Mountain Coffee to Taco Bell, Air Wick, and even Pinnacle vodka. Each partner now makes products that capture the irresistible Cinnabon taste and smell. Cinnabon now captures more than $1 billion annually in consumer packaged goods sales, accounting for 75 percent of the brand’s total revenues.

## Assessing Competitors

Having identified the main competitors, marketing management now asks: What are the competitors’ objectives? What does each seek in the marketplace? What is each competitor’s strategy? What are various competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, and how will each react to actions the company might take?

### Determining Competitors’ Objectives

Each competitor has a mix of objectives. The company wants to know the relative importance that a competitor places on current profitability, market share growth, cash flow, technological leadership, service leadership, and other goals. Knowing a competitor’s mix of objectives reveals whether the competitor is satisfied with its current situation and how it might react to different competitive actions. For example, a company that pursues low-cost leadership will react much more strongly to a competitor’s cost-reducing manufacturing breakthrough than to the same competitor’s increase in advertising.

A company also must monitor its competitors’ objectives for various segments. If the company finds that a competitor has discovered a new segment, this might be an opportunity. If it finds that competitors plan new moves into segments now served by the company, it will be forewarned and, hopefully, forearmed.

### Identifying Competitors’ Strategies

The more that one firm’s strategy resembles another firm’s strategy, the more the two firms compete. In most industries, the competitors can be sorted into groups that pursue different strategies. 

> **Strategic group**  
> A group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar strategy.

A **strategic group** is a group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar strategy in a given target market. For example, in the auto industry, Ford and Toyota belong to the same strategic group. Each produces a full line of low- to medium-price mainstream vehicles supported by great warranties and broad dealership networks. BMW, Audi, and Mercedes belong to a different strategic group that focuses more on luxury performance. In contrast, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and McLaren produce narrower lines of very high-performance, premium-priced sports cars through a highly exclusive distribution and support network.

Some important insights emerge from identifying strategic groups. For example, if a company enters a strategic group, the members of that group become its key competitors. Thus, if the company enters a group against Ford and Toyota, it can succeed only if it develops strategic advantages over these two companies. Tesla is doing this by introducing more mainstream all-electric cars such as the Tesla Model 3. Tesla can succeed only if its models outperform and outclass the hybrid and electric models of the major automakers.
