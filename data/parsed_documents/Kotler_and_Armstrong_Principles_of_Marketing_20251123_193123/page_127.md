# Assessing Information Needs and Developing Data

> **Figure 4.1** shows that the MIS begins and ends with information users—marketing managers, internal and external partners, and others who need marketing information and insights. First, it interacts with these information users to assess information needs. Next, it interacts with the marketing environment to develop needed information through internal company databases, marketing intelligence activities, and marketing research. Finally, the MIS helps users to analyze and use the information to develop customer insights, make marketing decisions, and manage customer engagement and relationships.

> **Author Comment:** The marketing information system begins and ends with users—assessing their information needs and then delivering information and insights that meet those needs.

## Assessing Marketing Information Needs

The marketing information system primarily serves the company’s marketing and other managers. However, it may also provide information to external partners, such as suppliers, resellers, or marketing services agencies. For example, Walmart’s Retail Link system gives key suppliers access to information on everything from customers’ buying patterns and store inventory levels to how many items they’ve sold in which stores in the past 24 hours.⁵

A good marketing information system balances the information users *would like* to have against what they really *need* and what is *feasible* to offer. Some managers will ask for whatever information they can get without thinking carefully about what they really need. And in this age of big data, some managers will want to collect and store vast amounts of digital data simply because technology lets them. But too much information can be as harmful as too little. In contrast, other managers may omit things they ought to know, or they may not know to ask for some types of information they should have. The MIS must monitor the marketing environment to provide decision makers with information and insights they should have to make key marketing decisions.

Finally, the costs of obtaining, analyzing, storing, and delivering information can mount quickly. The company must decide whether the value of insights gained from additional information is worth the costs of providing it, and both value and cost are often hard to assess.

> **Author Comment:** The problem isn’t *finding* information; in this “big data” age, the world is bursting with information from a glut of sources. The real challenge is to find the *right* information—from inside and outside sources—and turn it into customer insights.

## Developing Marketing Information

Marketers can obtain the needed information from *internal data*, *marketing intelligence*, and *marketing research*.

### Figure 4.1 The Marketing Information System

This diagram illustrates a Marketing Information System (MIS) designed to provide marketing managers and other users with customer and market insights. The MIS is structured around the core process of developing and utilizing information. It begins with assessing information needs, which are then met through internal databases, marketing intelligence, and marketing research. Following the development of needed information, the system moves to analyzing and using this information. All these processes are influenced by the broader marketing environment, which encompasses target markets, marketing channels, competitors, publics, and macroenvironment forces. The overall structure depicts a cyclical flow where information is gathered, processed, and applied to inform marketing decisions within a dynamic environmental context.

> This chapter is all about managing marketing information to gain customer insights. And this important figure organizes the entire chapter. Marketers start by assessing user information needs. Then they develop the needed information using internal data, marketing intelligence, and marketing research processes. Finally, they make the information available to users in the right form at the right time.
