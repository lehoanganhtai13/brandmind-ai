# Chapter 1 | Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement

of stomach.” Car companies want to increase “share of garage,” and airlines want greater “share of travel.”

To increase share of customer, firms can offer greater variety to current customers. Or they can create programs to cross-sell and up-sell to market more products and services to existing customers. For example, Amazon is highly skilled at leveraging relationships with its 304 million customers worldwide to increase its share of each customer’s spending budget:[^24]

> Once they log onto Amazon.com, customers often buy more than they intend, and Amazon does all it can to help make that happen. The online giant continues to broaden its merchandise assortment, creating an ideal spot for one-stop shopping. And based on each customer’s purchase and search history, the company recommends related products that might be of interest. This recommendation system influences perhaps a third of all sales. Amazon’s ingenious Amazon Prime two-day shipping program has also helped boost its share of customers’ wallets. For an annual fee of $99, Prime members receive delivery of all their purchases within two days, whether it’s a single paperback book or a 60-inch HDTV. According to one analyst, the ingenious Amazon Prime program “converts casual shoppers, who gorge on the gratification of having purchases reliably appear two days after the order, into Amazon addicts.” As a result, Amazon’s 54 million U.S. Prime customers now account for more than half of its U.S. sales. On average, a Prime customer spends 1.8 times more than a non-Prime customer.

## Building Customer Equity

We can now see the importance of not only acquiring customers but also keeping and growing them. The value of a company comes from the value of its current and future customers. Customer relationship management takes a long-term view. Companies want to not only create profitable customers but also “own” them for life, earn a greater share of their purchases, and capture their customer lifetime value.

### What Is Customer Equity?

The ultimate aim of customer relationship management is to produce high *customer equity.*[^25] **Customer equity** is the total combined customer lifetime values of all of the company’s current and potential customers. As such, it’s a measure of the future value of the company’s customer base. Clearly, the more loyal the firm’s profitable customers, the higher its customer equity. Customer equity may be a better measure of a firm’s performance than current sales or market share. Whereas sales and market share reflect the past, customer equity suggests the future. ● Consider Cadillac:[^26]

In the 1970s and 1980s, Cadillac had some of the most loyal customers in the industry. To an entire generation of car buyers, the name *Cadillac* defined “The Standard of the World.” Cadillac’s share of the luxury car market reached a whopping 51 percent in 1976, and based on market share and sales, the brand’s future looked rosy. However, measures of customer equity would have painted a bleaker picture. Cadillac customers were getting older (average age 60), and average customer lifetime value was falling. Many Cadillac buyers were on their last cars. Thus, although Cadillac’s market share was good, its customer equity was not.

Compare this with BMW. Its more youthful and vigorous image didn’t win BMW the early market share war. However, it did win BMW younger customers (average age about 40) with higher customer lifetime values. The result: In the years that followed, BMW’s market share and profits soared while Cadillac’s fortunes eroded badly. BMW overtook Cadillac in the 1980s. In recent years, Cadillac has struggled to make the Caddy cool again with edgier, high-performance designs that target a younger generation of consumers. More recently, the brand has billed itself as “The New Standard of the World” with marketing pitches based on “power, performance, and design,” attributes that position it more effectively against the likes of BMW and Audi. Recent ads feature young achievers and invite consumers to “Dare Greatly” and “Drive the world forward.” However, for the past decade, Cadillac’s share of the luxury car market has stagnated.
