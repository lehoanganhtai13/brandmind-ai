# Understanding the Marketplace and Consumer Value

Economic environment: Consumers adopted a new back-to-basics sensibility in their lifestyles and spending patterns. To serve the tastes of these more financially frugal buyers, companies like Target are emphasizing the “pay less” side of their value propositions.

You’d expect value pitches from the sellers of everyday products.  
*For example, as Target has shifted emphasis toward the “Pay Less” side of its “Expect More. Pay Less.” slogan, the once-chic headlines at the Target.com website have been replaced by more practical appeals such as “Our lowest prices of the season,” “Slam dunk deals,” and “Free shipping, every day.”* However, these days, even luxury-brand marketers are emphasizing good value. For example, Tiffany has long been known for selling high-end “fine jewelry” and “statement jewelry” at prices of $5,000 to $50,000 or more. However, when the Great Recession eroded Tiffany’s high-end sales, the company began offering affordable luxury items—what it calls “fashion jewelry”—priced at as little as $100 to $500. Such relatively affordable items now account for about one-quarter of Tiffany’s sales.⁴³

Marketers should pay attention to *income distribution* as well as income levels. Over the past several decades, the rich have grown richer, the middle class has shrunk, and the poor have remained poor. The top 5 percent of American earners capture 22 percent of the country’s adjusted gross income, and the top 20 percent of earners capture 51 percent of all income. In contrast, the bottom 40 percent of American earners get just 11 percent of the total income.⁴⁴

This distribution of income has created a tiered market. Many companies—such as Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus—aggressively target the affluent. Others—such as Dollar General, Five Below, and Family Dollar—target those with more modest means. Still other companies tailor their marketing offers across a range of markets, from the less affluent to the very affluent. For example, Ford offers cars ranging from the low-priced Ford Fiesta, starting at $14,090, to the luxury Lincoln Navigator SUV, starting at $63,195.

Changes in major economic variables, such as income, cost of living, interest rates, and savings and borrowing patterns, have a large impact on the marketplace. Companies watch these variables by using economic forecasting. Businesses do not have to be wiped out by an economic downturn or caught short in a boom. With adequate warning, they can take advantage of changes in the economic environment.

## The Natural and Technological Environments

> **Author Comment:**  
> Today’s enlightened companies are developing *environmentally sustainable* strategies in an effort to create a world economy that the planet can support indefinitely.

### The Natural Environment

The **natural environment** involves the physical environment and the natural resources that are needed as inputs by marketers or that are affected by marketing activities. At the most basic level, unexpected happenings in the physical environment—anything from weather to natural disasters—can affect companies and their marketing strategies. For example, during a recent cold winter—in which the term *polar vortex* gusted into the American vocabulary—sales suffered across a wide range of businesses, from florists and auto dealers to restaurants, airlines, and tourist destinations. In contrast, the severe weather boosted demand for products such as salt, snowblowers, winter clothing, and auto repair centers.

Although companies can’t prevent such natural occurrences, they should prepare for dealing with them. For example, shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS maintain corps of meteorologists on their staffs to anticipate weather conditions that might inhibit on-time deliveries around the world. “Someone awaiting a package in Bangkok doesn’t care if it snowed in Louisville, Kentucky,” says a UPS meteorologist. “They want their stuff.”⁴⁵

At a broader level, environmental sustainability concerns have grown steadily over the past several decades. In many cities around the world, air and water pollution have reached dangerous levels. World concern continues to mount about the possibilities of global warming, and many environmentalists fear that we soon will be buried in our own trash.

Marketers should be aware of several trends in the natural environment. The first involves growing *shortages of raw materials*. Air and water may seem to be infinite resources, but some groups see long-run dangers. Air pollution chokes many of the world’s large cities, and water shortages are already a big problem in some parts of the United States and the world. By 2030, more than one in three people in the world will not have enough water.
