The five major promotion tools are defined as follows:

* **Advertising.** Any paid form of nonpersonal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor.
* **Sales promotion.** Short-term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of a product or service.
* **Personal selling.** Personal customer interactions by the firm’s sales force for the purpose of engaging customers, making sales, and building customer relationships.
* **Public relations (PR).** Building good relations with the company’s various publics by obtaining favorable publicity, building up a good corporate image, and handling or heading off unfavorable rumors, stories, and events.
* **Direct and digital marketing.** Engaging directly with carefully targeted individual consumers and customer communities to both obtain an immediate response and build lasting customer relationships.

Each category involves specific promotional tools that are used to communicate with customers. For example, *advertising* includes broadcast, print, online, mobile, outdoor, and other forms. *Sales promotion* includes discounts, coupons, displays, demonstrations, and events. *Personal selling* includes sales presentations, trade shows, and incentive programs. *Public relations* includes press releases, sponsorships, events, and webpages. And *direct and digital marketing* includes direct mail, email, catalogs, online and social media, mobile marketing, and more.

At the same time, marketing communication goes beyond these specific promotion tools. The product’s design, its price, the shape and color of its package, and the stores that sell it—*all* communicate something to buyers. Thus, although the promotion mix is the company’s primary engagement and communications activity, the entire marketing mix—promotion *and* product, price, and place—must be coordinated for greatest impact.

> **Author Comment**  
> Integrated marketing communications—IMC—is a really hot topic these days. No other area of marketing is changing so quickly and profoundly. A big part of the reason is the huge surge in customer engagement through digital media—online, mobile, and social media marketing.

# Integrated Marketing Communications
In past decades, marketers perfected the art of mass marketing: selling highly standardized products to masses of customers. In the process, they developed effective mass-media communication techniques to support these strategies. Large companies now routinely invest millions or even billions of dollars in television, magazine, or other mass-media advertising, reaching tens of millions of customers with a single ad. Today, however, marketing managers face some new marketing communications realities. Perhaps no other area of marketing is changing so profoundly as marketing communications, creating both exciting and challenging times for marketing communicators.

## The New Marketing Communications Model
Several major factors are changing the face of today’s marketing communications. First, **consumers** are changing. In this digital, wireless age, consumers are better informed and more communications empowered. Rather than relying on marketer-supplied information, they can use the internet, social media, and other technologies to find information on their own. They can connect easily with other consumers to exchange brand-related information or even create their own brand messages and experiences.

Second, *marketing strategies* are changing. As mass markets have fragmented, marketers are shifting away from mass marketing. More and more, they are developing focused marketing programs designed to engage customers and build customer relationships in more narrowly defined micromarkets.

Finally, sweeping advances in *digital technology* are causing remarkable changes in the ways companies and customers communicate with each other. The digital age has spawned a host of new information and communication tools—from satellite and cable television systems to smartphones and tablets to the many faces of the internet (brand websites, email, blogs, social media and online communities, the mobile web), and so much more.
