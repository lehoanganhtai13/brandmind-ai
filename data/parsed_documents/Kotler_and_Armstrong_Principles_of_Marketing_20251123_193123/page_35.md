# Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process

## Figure 1.2  
### A Modern Marketing System

This diagram illustrates the relationship between suppliers, marketing intermediaries, and final consumers within a market environment. Suppliers, encompassing both individual companies and competitors, interact with marketing intermediaries. These intermediaries, in turn, facilitate the flow of goods or services to the final consumers. The entire system is influenced by major environmental forces, which are presented as an overarching element impacting all other components. The structure suggests a supply chain or distribution channel model, highlighting the roles of different entities and the external factors that shape their interactions in reaching the end-user.

> Each party in the system adds value.  
> Walmart cannot fulfill its promise of low prices unless its suppliers provide low costs. Ford cannot deliver a high-quality car-ownership experience unless its dealers provide outstanding service.

> Arrows represent relationships that must be developed and managed to create customer value and profitable customer relationships.

Figure 1.2 shows the main elements in a marketing system. Marketing involves serving a market of final consumers in the face of competitors. The company and competitors research the market and interact with consumers to understand their needs. Then they create and exchange market offerings, messages, and other marketing content with consumers, either directly or through marketing intermediaries. Each party in the system is affected by major environmental forces (demographic, economic, natural, technological, political, and social/cultural).

Each party in the system adds value for the next level. The arrows represent relationships that must be developed and managed. Thus, a company’s success at engaging customers and building profitable relationships depends not only on its own actions but also on how well the entire system serves the needs of final consumers. Walmart cannot fulfill its promise of low prices unless its suppliers provide merchandise at low costs. And Ford cannot deliver a high-quality car-ownership experience unless its dealers provide outstanding sales and service.

> **Author Comment:** Once a company fully understands its consumers and the marketplace, it must decide which customers it will serve and how it will bring them value.

# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy and Plan

## Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

Once it fully understands consumers and the marketplace, marketing management can design a customer value–driven marketing strategy. We define **marketing management** as the art and science of choosing target markets and building profitable relationships with them. The marketing manager’s aim is to engage, keep, and grow target customers by creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value.

To design a winning marketing strategy, the marketing manager must answer two important questions: *What customers will we serve (what’s our target market)?* and *How can we serve these customers best (what’s our value proposition)?* We will discuss these marketing strategy concepts briefly here and then look at them in more detail in Chapters 2 and 7.

## Selecting Customers to Serve

The company must first decide *whom* it will serve. It does this by dividing the market into segments of customers (*market segmentation*) and selecting which segments it will go after (*target marketing*). Some people think of marketing management as finding as many customers as possible and increasing demand. But marketing managers know that they cannot serve all customers in every way. By trying to serve all customers, they may not serve any customers well. Instead, the company wants to select only customers that it can serve well and profitably. For example, Nordstrom profitably targets affluent professionals; Dollar General profitably targets families with more modest means.

Ultimately, marketing managers must decide which customers they want to target and on the level, timing, and nature of their demand. Simply put, marketing management is *customer management* and *demand management*.
