In 2005, 7-Eleven Japan created Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings, which acquired the remaining shares of 7-Eleven. Then, in a case of the student becoming the teacher, the new parent corporation applied its well-honed “retailer initiative” skills to strengthen the U.S. division.

Wherever it operates, 7-Eleven seeks to become a part of the local culture. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Indonesia, one of 7-Eleven’s newest markets. On a typical Saturday night, thousands of young Indonesians gather at one of the country’s 200 7-Eleven’s to sip coffee or beer at outdoor café tables, listen to live music, and engage in their newest passion—the internet. Sounds more like Starbucks? That’s no accident. As Seven & I Holdings analyzed the Indonesian market, it learned that hanging out and doing nothing—something the locals refer to as “nongkrong”—is a favorite pastime. People gather at street markets, roadside food stalls, and Western fast-food outlets simply to pass the time and share stories. However, when 7-Eleven entered Indonesia, such hangouts were in short supply and few hangouts provided wireless connectivity. So 7-Eleven Indonesia adopted the Starbucks-like concept of a “third place”—somewhere to go that’s away from home and work.

7-Eleven Indonesia still offers basic convenience store products, such as inexpensive readymade food, snacks, and a variety of popular beverages. And its 24-hour operations are perfect for an Indonesian culture not bound by time. But to appeal more strongly to plugged-in 18- to 35-year-old customers, 7-Eleven Indonesia also provides hassle-free parking (a premium convenience in the traffic-choked island nation), a venue for local bands, air-conditioning, free wireless connectivity, and lots and lots of space to hang out. More than a no-frills store where customers can grab snacks and everyday products, 7-Eleven Indonesia has become a trendy place where young people spend time, surf the internet, and meet friends.

Thus, 7-Eleven’s fine-tuned global marketing strategy has made it the world’s largest convenience store chain. Wherever 7-Eleven operates, its overall brand identity and convenience positioning remain constant: “At 7-Eleven, our purpose and mission is to make life a little easier for our guests,” says the company, by “giving customers what they want, when and where they want it.” But 7-Eleven knows that those whats, whens, and wheres can shift dramatically from market to market. The real secret is to weave the global 7-Eleven strategy into the fabric of each local culture.

Collectively, local brands still account for the overwhelming majority of consumer purchases. Most consumers, wherever they live, lead very local lives. So a global brand must engage consumers at a local level, respecting the culture and becoming a part of it. For example, 7-Eleven has become the world’s largest convenience store chain by skillfully adapting its operations in each global market to match widely differing local definitions of just what “convenience” means (see Real Marketing 19.2).

## Product

Five strategies are used for adapting product and marketing communication strategies to a global market (see green circle Figure 19.3). We first discuss the three product strategies and then turn to the two communication strategies.

**Straight product extension** means marketing a product in a foreign market without making significant changes to the product. Top management tells its marketing people, “Take the product as is and find customers for it.” The first step, however, should be to find out whether foreign consumers use that product and what form they prefer.

Straight extension has been successful in some cases and disastrous in others. Apple iPads, Gillette razors, and Black & Decker tools are all sold successfully in about the same form around the world. But when General Foods introduced its standard powdered JELL-O in the British market, it discovered that British consumers prefer a solid wafer or

This table outlines a framework for product and communications strategy, categorizing approaches based on whether the product and its associated communications are changed or adapted. The structure presents a 2x3 matrix, where the rows represent the level of change in communications ("Don't change communications" and "Adapt communications") and the columns represent the level of change in the product ("Don't change product," "Adapt product," and "Develop new product"). The intersections yield four distinct strategic approaches: "Straight extension" (no change in either product or communications), "Product adaptation" (product adapted, communications unchanged), "Communication adaptation" (communications adapted, product unchanged), and "Dual adaptation" (both product and communications adapted). A fifth category, "Product invention," arises when new products are developed, irrespective of whether communications are changed or adapted. This framework illustrates how product and communication modifications can be combined to create different market entry or repositioning strategies.

> The real question buried in this figure is this: How much should a company standardize or adapt its products and marketing across global markets?
