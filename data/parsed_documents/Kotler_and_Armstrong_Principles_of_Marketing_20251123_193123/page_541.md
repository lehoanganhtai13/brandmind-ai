# 18 Creating Competitive Advantage

> **CHAPTER PREVIEW**  
> In previous chapters, you explored the basics of marketing. You learned that the aim of marketing is to engage customers and to create value for them in order to capture value *from* them in return. Good marketing companies win, keep, and grow customers by understanding customer needs, designing customer-driven marketing strategies, constructing value-delivering marketing programs, engaging customers, and building customer and marketing partner relationships. In the final three chapters, we’ll extend this concept to three special areas: creating competitive advantage, global marketing, and social and environmental marketing sustainability.

To start, let’s dig into the competitive strategy of Microsoft, the technology giant that dominated the computer software world throughout the 1990s and much of the 2000s. Its Windows and Office products have long been must-haves in the PC market. But with the decline in standalone personal computers and the surge in digitally connected devices—everything from smartphones and tablets to internet-connected TVs—mighty Microsoft recently found itself struggling to revamp its competitive marketing strategy in a fast-changing digital environment. The tech giant is now reinventing itself as a relevant brand that consumers can’t live without in the post-PC era.

## MICROSOFT: A New Competitive Marketing Strategy for the Post-PC Era

Fifteen years ago, talking high-tech meant talking about the almighty personal computer. Intel provided the PC microprocessors, and manufacturers such as Dell and HP built and marketed the machines. But it was Microsoft that really drove the PC industry—it made the operating systems that made most PCs go. As the dominant software developer, Microsoft put its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite on almost every computer sold.

The huge success of Windows drove Microsoft’s revenues, profits, and stock price to dizzying heights. By the start of 2000, the total value of Microsoft’s stock had hit a record $619 billion, making it the most valuable company in history. In those heady days, no company was more relevant than Microsoft. And from a competitive standpoint, no company was more powerful.

But moving through the first decade of the new millennium, PC sales growth flattened as the world fell in love with a rush of alluring new digital devices and technologies. It started with iPods and smartphones and evolved rapidly into a full complement of digital devices—from e-readers, tablets, and sleek new laptops to internet-connected TVs and game consoles. These devices are connected and mobile, not stationary standalones like the old PCs. They link users to an ever-on, head-spinning new world of information, entertainment, and socialization options. And, for the most part, these new devices were coming to market without the need for Microsoft’s tried-and-true products. Increasingly, even the trusty old PC became a digital-connection device—a gateway to the web, social media, and cloud computing. And much of that could be done without once-indispensable Microsoft software.

More than just making the software that makes PCs run, Microsoft now wants to be a full-line digital devices and services company that connects people to communication, productivity, entertainment, and one another.**

In this new digitally connected world, Microsoft found itself lagging behind new, more-glamorous competitors such as Google, Apple, Samsung, and even Amazon and Facebook, which seemed to provide all things digital—the smart devices, the connecting technologies, and even the digital destinations. In the new competitive environment, although still financially strong and still the world’s dominant PC software maker, Microsoft lost some of its luster.
