However, before you engage your potential employer, be sure to research the company. Knowing about the company and understanding its place in the industry will help you shine. When you place a call, send an email, or mail a letter to a company contact, be sure to restate your interest in the position, check on the status of your résumé, and ask employers about any questions they may have.

## Letters of Recommendation

Letters of recommendation are written references by professors, former and current employers, and others that testify to your character, skills, and abilities. Some companies may request letters of recommendation, to be submitted either with the résumé or at the interview. Even if letters of recommendation aren’t requested, it’s a good idea to bring them with you to the interview. A good reference letter tells why you would be an excellent candidate for the position. In choosing someone to write a letter of recommendation, be confident that the person will give you a good reference. In addition, do not assume the person knows everything about you or the position you are seeking. Rather, provide the person with your résumé and other relevant data. As a courtesy, allow the reference writer at least a month to complete the letter and enclose a stamped, addressed envelope with your materials.

In the packet containing your résumé, cover letter, and letters of recommendation, you may also want to attach other relevant documents that support your candidacy, such as academic transcripts, graphics, portfolios, and samples of writing.

## Interview for Jobs

As the old saying goes, “The résumé gets you the interview; the interview gets you the job.” The job interview offers you an opportunity to gather more information about the organization, while at the same time allowing the organization to gather more information about you. You’ll want to present your best self. The interview process consists of three parts: before the interview, the interview itself, and after the interview. If you pass through these stages successfully, you will be called back for the follow-up interview.

### Before the Interview

In preparing for your interview, do the following:

1. Understand that interviewers have diverse styles, including the “chitchat,” let’s-get-to-know-each-other style; the interrogation style of question after question; and the tough-probing “why, why, why” style, among others. So be ready for anything.  
2. With a friend, practice being interviewed and then ask for a critique. Or videotape yourself in a practice interview so that you can critique your own performance. Your college placement service may also offer “mock” interviews to help you.  
3. Prepare at least five good questions whose answers are not easily found in the company literature, such as “What is the future direction of the firm?” “How does the firm differentiate itself from competitors?” or “Do you have a new-media division?”  
4. Anticipate possible interview questions, such as “Why do you want to work for this company?” or “Why should we hire you?” Prepare solid answers before the interview. Have a clear idea of why you are interested in joining the company and the industry to which it belongs.  
5. Avoid back-to-back interviews—they can be exhausting, and it is unpredictable how long each will last.  
6. Prepare relevant documents that support your candidacy, such as academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, graphics, portfolios, and samples of writing. Bring multiple copies to the interview.  
7. Dress conservatively and professionally. Be neat and clean.  
8. Arrive 10 minutes early to collect your thoughts and review the major points you intend to cover. Check your name on the interview schedule, noting the name of the interviewer and the room number. Be courteous and polite to office staff.  
9. Approach the interview enthusiastically. Let your personality shine through.
