scene-by-scene impact of the ad on viewer attention, emotional engagement, and memory activation. They discovered that viewer attention and emotional engagement jumped when Jules was on the screen. They also learned that the end of the ad caused confusion, with Jules, the logo, and the website URL all competing for viewer attention. The creative team re-edited the ad, increasing Jules’s onscreen moments and sharpening the ad’s ending and call to action. A second round of neuroscience tests showed that the recrafted ad held viewers’ attention better, kept them more consistently engaged, and improved ad recall. As a result, in the first three months after the launch of the refreshed ad, traffic to the Shelter Pet Project website more than doubled, a change that may have real life-or-death implications for shelter pets.

Although neuromarketing techniques can measure consumer involvement and emotional responses second by second, such brain responses can be difficult to interpret. Thus, neuromarketing is usually used in combination with other research approaches to gain a more complete picture of what goes on inside consumers’ heads.

## Implementing the Research Plan  
The researcher next puts the marketing research plan into action. This involves collecting, processing, and analyzing the information. Data collection can be carried out by the company’s marketing research staff or outside firms. Researchers should watch closely to make sure that the plan is implemented correctly. They must guard against problems with data collection techniques and technologies, data quality, and timeliness.

Researchers must also process and analyze the collected data to isolate important information and insights. They need to check data for accuracy and completeness and code them for analysis. The researchers then tabulate the results and compute statistical measures.

## Interpreting and Reporting the Findings  
The market researcher must now interpret the findings, draw conclusions, and report them to management. The researcher should not try to overwhelm managers with numbers and fancy statistical techniques. Rather, the researcher should present important findings and insights that are useful in the major decisions faced by management.

However, interpretation should not be left only to researchers. Although they are often experts in research design and statistics, the marketing manager knows more about the problem and the decisions that must be made. The best research means little if the manager blindly accepts faulty interpretations from the researcher. Similarly, managers may be biased. They might tend to accept research results that show what they expected and reject those that they did not expect or hope for. In many cases, findings can be interpreted in different ways, and discussions between researchers and managers will help point to the best interpretations. Thus, managers and researchers must work together closely when interpreting research results, and both must share responsibility for the research process and resulting decisions.

> We’ve talked generally about managing customer relationships throughout the book.  
> *But here, customer relationship management* (CRM) has a much narrower data-management meaning. It refers to capturing and using customer data from all sources to manage customer interactions, engage customers, and build customer relationships.

## Analyzing and Using Marketing Information  
Information gathered from internal databases, competitive marketing intelligence, and marketing research usually requires additional analysis. Managers may need help applying the information to gain customer and market insights that will improve their marketing decisions. This help may include advanced analytics to learn more about the relationships within sets of data. Information analysis might also involve the application of analytical models that will help marketers make better decisions.

Once the information has been processed and analyzed, it must be made available to the right decision makers at the right time. In the following sections, we look deeper into analyzing and using marketing information.
