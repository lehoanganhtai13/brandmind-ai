# High-Pressure Selling

It is often said that insurance, real estate, and used cars are *sold*, not *bought*. Salespeople are trained to deliver smooth, canned talks to entice purchases. They sell hard because sales contests promise big prizes to those who sell the most. Similarly, TV infomercial pitchmen use “yell and sell” presentations that create a sense of consumer urgency that only those with strong willpower can resist.

But in most cases, marketers have little to gain from high-pressure selling. Although such tactics may work in one-time selling situations for short-term gain, most selling involves building long-term relationships with valued customers. High-pressure or deceptive selling can seriously damage such relationships. For example, imagine a P&G account manager trying to pressure a Walmart buyer or an IBM salesperson trying to browbeat an information technology manager at GE. It simply wouldn’t work.

# Shoddy, Harmful, or Unsafe Products

Another criticism concerns poor product quality or function. One complaint is that, too often, products and services are not made well or do not perform well. A second complaint concerns product safety. Product safety has been a problem for several reasons, including company indifference, increased product complexity, and poor quality control. A third complaint is that many products deliver little benefit or may even be harmful.

For example, think about the soft drink industry. For years, industry critics have blamed the plentiful supply of sugar-laden, high-calorie soft drinks for the obesity epidemic and other health issues in the United States. They are quick to fault what they see as greedy beverage marketers for cashing in on vulnerable consumers, turning us into a nation of Big Gulpers. Although U.S. consumption of soft drinks has dropped in recent years, beverage companies are now looking to emerging markets for growth.

> **Harmful products: Is the soft drink industry being irresponsible by promoting harmful products in emerging markets, or is it simply serving the wants of consumers while letting them make their own consumption choices?**  
> Center for Science in the Public Interest

According to a report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) titled “Carbonating the World,” in 2008 emerging markets such as China, India, and Mexico accounted for just over half of global soft drink consumption. But by 2018 nearly 70 percent of soft drinks will be sold in such markets. The CSPI accuses beverage companies of behaving much like the tobacco industry, marketing their harmful products to countries already struggling to provide health care to their citizens.

Is the soft drink industry being socially irresponsible by aggressively promoting overindulgence to ill-informed or unwary consumers in emerging markets? Or is it simply serving the wants of customers by offering products that ping consumer taste buds while letting consumers make their own consumption choices? Is it the industry’s job to police public tastes? As in many matters of social responsibility, what’s right and wrong may be a matter of opinion. Whereas some analysts criticize the industry, others suggest that responsibility lies with consumers. Maybe companies shouldn’t sell Big Gulps. Then again, nobody is forced to buy and drink one.

Most manufacturers *want* to produce quality goods. After all, the way a company deals with product quality and safety problems can harm or help its reputation. Companies selling poor-quality or unsafe products risk damaging conflicts with consumer groups and regulators. Unsafe products can result in product liability suits and large awards for damages. More fundamentally, consumers who are unhappy with a firm’s products may avoid future purchases and talk other consumers into doing the same. In today’s social media and online review environment, word of poor quality can spread like wildfire. Thus, quality missteps are not consistent with sustainable marketing. Today’s marketers know that good quality results in customer value and satisfaction, which in turn create sustainable customer relationships.

# Planned Obsolescence

Critics also have charged that some companies practice *planned obsolescence*, causing their products to become obsolete before they actually should need replacement. They accuse some producers of using materials and components that will break, wear, rust, or rot sooner than they should. And if the products themselves don’t wear out fast enough, other companies are charged with
