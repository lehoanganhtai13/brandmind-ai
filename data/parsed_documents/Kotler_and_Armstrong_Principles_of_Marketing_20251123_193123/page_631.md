# Table A1.1 | Segment Needs and Corresponding Features/Benefits of NutriWater

This table outlines a product's strategy for targeting distinct customer segments, detailing their specific needs and the corresponding features or benefits offered. For athletes, the focus is on hydration and energy, met by electrolytes, carbohydrates, and B vitamins. Health-conscious individuals seek weight management, optimal nutrition, and natural ingredients, addressed by lower calorie counts, higher vitamin and mineral content, all-natural components, and diverse flavors. Socially conscious consumers are motivated by supporting charitable causes, with the product contributing a donation to Vitamin Angels per purchase. Millennials, characterized by a distrust of mass media and a fast-paced lifestyle, are targeted through less invasive online promotions, the company's private ownership status, and comprehensive vitamin and mineral content for diet enhancement. The structure is comparative, mapping segment-specific needs to tailored product attributes.

* Formulated for wellness, replenishment, and optimum energy.  
* Full recommended daily allowance (RDA) of essential vitamins and minerals (including electrolytes).  
* Higher vitamin concentration—vitamin levels are 2 to 10 times higher than market-leading products, with more vitamins and minerals than any other brand.  
* Additional vitamins—vitamins include A, E, and B₂ as well as folic acid—none of which are contained in the market-leading products.  
* All natural—no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.  
* Sweetened with pure cane sugar and Stevia, a natural zero-calorie sweetener.  
* Twenty-five cents from each purchase will be donated to Vitamin Angels, a nonprofit organization with a mission to prevent vitamin deficiency in at-risk children.

## Competitive Review

As sales of bottled waters entered a strong growth phase in the 1990s, the category began to expand. In addition to the various types of plain water, new categories emerged. These included flavored waters—such as Aquafina’s Flavorsplash—as well as functional waters. Functional waters emerged to bridge the gap between soft drinks and waters, appealing to people who knew they should drink more water and less soft drinks but still wanted flavor. Initially, development of brands for this product variation occurred in start-up and boutique beverage companies like SoBe and Glacéau, creator of Vitaminwater. In the 2000s, major beverage corporations acquired the most successful smaller brands, providing the bigger firms with a solid market position in this category and diversification in bottled waters in general. Backed by the marketing expertise and budgets of the leading beverage companies, functional water grew at a rate exceeding that of plain water.

At one point, Coca-Cola’s Vitaminwater was the fourth-largest bottled water brand, behind Nestlé Pure Life, Coca-Cola’s Dasani, and Pepsi’s Aquafina. After taking a hit in the press for the low amount of vitamins and high amount of sugar contained in most brands of vitamin-enhanced waters, sales for vitamin water brands temporarily slipped. But Coca-Cola lost no ground as sales for Smartwater—Vitaminwater’s non-flavored sibling—rose to the fourth largest brand. Currently, functional water sales account for approximately 20 percent of the total bottled water market, and industry insiders expect sales to outpace nonfunctional waters in the coming years.
