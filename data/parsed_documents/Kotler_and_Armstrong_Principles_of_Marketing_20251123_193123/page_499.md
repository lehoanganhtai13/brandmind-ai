For example, at outdoor outfitter REI, customers can pay a $20 one-time fee to become a lifetime member. Once members, they receive members-only coupons and deals, access to exclusive limited-edition products and events, and special pricing on certain REI-sponsored travel, services, and classes. Another membership perk is the REI Dividend—an annual year-end 10 percent back on all their eligible purchases. Beyond the perks, the success of REI’s membership program lies in its ability to make members feel like a genuine part of the REI outdoor adventure community.

**Consumer promotions**  
Sales promotion tools used to boost short-term customer buying and engagement or enhance long-term customer relationships.

**Consumer Promotions**  
Consumer promotions include a wide range of tools—from samples, coupons, refunds, premiums, and point-of-purchase displays to contests, sweepstakes, and event sponsorships.

*Samples* are offers of a trial amount of a product. Sampling is the most effective—but most expensive—way to introduce a new product or create new excitement for an existing one. Some samples are free; for others, the company charges a small amount to offset its cost. The sample might be sent by mail, handed out in a store or at a kiosk, attached to another product, or featured in an ad, email, or mobile offer. Samples are sometimes combined into sample packs, which can then be used to promote other products and services. Sampling can be a powerful promotional tool.  

For example, for the past 37 years, Ben & Jerry’s has set aside one day each year as Free Cone Day, on which it invites customers to stop by its scoop shops to sample any of a variety of the brand’s classic ice cream flavors for free. Around the country, the unique sampling promotion is a huge success, with lines stretching out the doors and around the block at most shops. Officially, Ben & Jerry’s uses Free Cone Day to thank its customers for being “so uniquely awesome.” But the sampling program also generates tons of buzz and draws new customers into its shops, something that Ben & Jerry’s hopes will turn into a habit.

*Coupons* are certificates that save buyers money when they purchase specified products. Most consumers love coupons. U.S. consumer packaged goods companies distributed 321 billion coupons with an average face value of $1.68 last year. Consumers redeemed more than 2.5 billion of them for a total savings of more than $3 billion.  
Coupons can promote early trial of a new brand or stimulate sales of a mature brand. However, to combat the increase in coupon clutter, most major consumer goods companies are issuing fewer coupons and targeting them more carefully.

Marketers are also cultivating new outlets for distributing coupons, such as supermarket shelf dispensers, electronic point-of-sale coupon printers, and online and mobile coupon programs. Digital coupons represent today’s fastest-growing coupon segment. Digital coupons can be individually targeted and personalized in ways that print coupons can’t. Whether printed at home or redeemed via smartphone or other mobile devices, digital coupon redemptions are growing much more rapidly than traditional coupon redemptions. According to one study, an estimated 40 percent of smartphone users will redeem a mobile coupon this year.

As mobile phones become appendages that many people can’t live without, businesses are increasingly eyeing them as prime real estate for coupons, offers, and other marketing.
