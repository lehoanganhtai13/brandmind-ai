# Breaking Through the Clutter

If all this clutter bothers some consumers, it also causes huge headaches for marketers. Take the situation facing network television advertisers. They pay an average of $342,000 to produce a single 30-second commercial. Then each time they show it, they pay an average of $112,100 for 30 seconds of advertising time during a popular primetime program. They pay even more if it’s an especially popular program, such as *Sunday Night Football* ($803,000), *Empire* ($497,000), *Big Bang Theory* ($348,000), or a mega-event such as the Super Bowl (averaging $5 million per 30 seconds!). Then their ads are sandwiched in with a clutter of other commercials, network promotions, and other nonprogram material totaling as much as 20 minutes per primetime hour, with long commercial breaks coming every six minutes on average. Such clutter in television and other ad media has created an increasingly hostile advertising environment.⁹

It used to be that television viewers were pretty much a captive audience for advertisers. But today’s digital wizardry has given viewers a rich new set of information and entertainment options—the internet, video streaming, social and mobile media, tablets and smartphones, and others.

Digital technology has also armed consumers with an arsenal of technologies for choosing what they watch or don’t watch and when. Increasingly, thanks to the growth of DVR systems and digital streaming, consumers are choosing *not* to watch ads.

Thus, advertisers can no longer force-feed the same old cookie-cutter messages and content to captive consumers through traditional media. Simply interrupting or disrupting consumers no longer works. Unless ads provide content that is engaging, useful, or entertaining, many consumers will simply ignore or skip them.

## Merging Advertising and Entertainment

To break through the clutter, many marketers have subscribed to a new merging of advertising and entertainment, dubbed **“Madison & Vine.”** You’ve probably heard of Madison Avenue, the New York City street that houses the headquarters of many of the nation’s largest advertising agencies. You may also have heard of Hollywood & Vine, the intersection of Hollywood Avenue and Vine Street in Hollywood, California, long the symbolic heart of the U.S. entertainment industry. Now, Madison Avenue and Hollywood & Vine have come together to form a new intersection—

> A term that has come to represent the merging of advertising and entertainment in an effort to break through the clutter and create new avenues for reaching customers with more engaging messages.

Madison & Vine—that represents the merging of advertising and entertainment in an effort to create new avenues for reaching consumers with more engaging messages.

This merging of advertising and entertainment takes one of two forms: advertainment or brand integrations. The aim of *advertainment* is to make ads and brand content themselves so entertaining or so useful that people *want* to watch them. There’s no chance that you’d watch ads on purpose, you say? Think again. For example, the Super Bowl has become an annual advertainment showcase. Tens of millions of people tune in to the Super Bowl each year, as much to watch the entertaining ads as to see the game. And ads and related content posted online before and after the big game draw tens of millions of views. These days, it’s common to see an entertaining ad on YouTube long before you see it on TV.

Advertisers are also creating content forms that look less like ads and more like short films or shows. A range of brand messaging platforms—from webisodes and blogs to online videos and social media posts—now blur the line between ads and other consumer content. For example, as part of its long-running, highly successful Campaign for Real Beauty, Unilever’s Dove brand has created numerous long-form ad videos about how women of all ages view themselves. Its “Real Beauty Sketches” video compared images of women drawn by an FBI-trained sketch artist based on their self-descriptions versus strangers’ descriptions of them. Side-by-side comparisons show that the stranger-described images are invariably more accurate and more flattering, creating strong reactions from the women. The tagline concludes, “You’re more beautiful than you think.” Although the award-winning video was never shown on TV, it drew more than 163 million global YouTube views within just two months, making it the most-watched video ever. Other blockbuster Dove Real Beauty videos—with titles such as “Evolution” and “Change One Thing”—have met with similar receptions.¹⁰

Marketers have tested all kinds of novel ways to break through today’s clutter and engage consumers. For example, Hostess Brands—maker of those yummy Twinkies, Ho Hos, Ding Dongs, and cream-filled cupcakes—recently shared a tweet celebrating the opening day of the Major League Baseball season.
