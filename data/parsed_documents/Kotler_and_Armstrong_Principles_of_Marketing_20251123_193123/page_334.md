# Market-Penetration Pricing

Market skimming makes sense only under certain conditions. First, the product’s quality and image must support its higher price, and enough buyers must want the product at that price. Second, the costs of producing a smaller volume cannot be so high that they cancel the advantage of charging more. Finally, competitors should not be able to enter the market easily and undercut the high price.

Rather than setting a high initial price to skim off small but profitable market segments, some companies use **market-penetration pricing**. Companies set a low initial price to *penetrate* the market quickly and deeply—to attract a large number of buyers quickly and win a large market share. The high sales volume results in falling costs, allowing companies to cut their prices even further. For example, AGIT Global used penetration pricing to quickly build demand for its Wavestorm surf boards:

> Before Wavestorm, surfers and would-be surfers typically bought custom-made or high-end surfboards at local surf shops, where entry-level boards typically run $300 to $1,000. AGIT Global had a different idea. With a mission to make surfing more accessible for both adults and children, it began 10 years ago mass-producing good quality soft-foam surfboards and selling them through big-box stores at penetration prices. For example, it sells an entry-level, 8-foot, blue-and-white Wavestorm board at Costco for only $99.99. Thanks to penetration pricing, Wavestorm is now the market leader, selling an estimated five times more boards than the other largest surfboard brands. The inexpensive boards have even become favorites of advanced surfers, who buy them for their friends or children. “Margins are slim at Costco,” says Matt Zilinskas, AGIT’s vice president of sales. “But we pump out volume and get paid on time.”

Several conditions must be met for this low-price strategy to work. First, the market must be highly price sensitive so that a low price produces more market growth. Second, production and distribution costs must decrease as sales volume increases. Finally, the low price must help keep out the competition, and the penetration pricer must maintain its low-price position. Otherwise, the price advantage may be only temporary.

> Most individual products are part of a broader product mix and must be priced accordingly. For example, Gillette prices its Fusion razors low. But once you buy the razor, you’re a captive customer for its higher-margin replacement cartridges.

# Product Mix Pricing Strategies

The strategy for setting a product’s price often has to be changed when the product is part of a product mix. In this case, the firm looks for a set of prices that maximizes its profits on the total product mix. Pricing is difficult because the various products have related demand and costs and face different degrees of competition. We now take a closer look at the five product mix pricing situations summarized in **Table 11.1**:  
*product line pricing, optional-product pricing, captive-product pricing, by-product pricing,* and *product bundle pricing*.

This table outlines five distinct pricing situations related to product strategy. Product line pricing involves setting prices for a range of related products. Optional-product pricing focuses on the pricing of accessories or add-ons that accompany a main product. Captive-product pricing addresses the pricing of essential complementary products required for the main product's use. By-product pricing deals with the strategic pricing of secondary, often low-value, outputs generated during the production of a primary product, either for disposal or profit. Finally, product bundle pricing involves setting a single price for a package of multiple products sold together. These strategies represent different approaches to managing pricing across a company's product offerings and their associated components or combinations.
