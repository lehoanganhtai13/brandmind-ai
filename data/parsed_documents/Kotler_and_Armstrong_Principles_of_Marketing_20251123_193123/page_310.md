# Major Pricing Strategies

However, smart managers treat pricing as a key strategic tool for creating and capturing customer value. Prices have a direct impact on a firm’s bottom line. A small percentage improvement in price can generate a large percentage increase in profitability. More important, as part of a company’s overall value proposition, price plays a key role in creating customer value and building customer relationships. So, instead of shying away from pricing, smart marketers are embracing it as an important competitive asset.²

> Setting the right price is one of the marketer’s most difficult tasks. A host of factors come into play. But as the opening story about Walmart and Amazon illustrates, finding and implementing the right pricing strategy is critical to success.

The price the company charges will fall somewhere between one that is too low to produce a profit and one that is too high to produce any demand.  
**Figure 10.1** summarizes the major considerations in setting prices. Customer perceptions of the product’s value set the ceiling for its price. If customers perceive that the product’s price is greater than its value, they will not buy the product. Likewise, product costs set the floor for a product’s price. If the company prices the product below its costs, the company’s profits will suffer. In setting its price between these two extremes, the company must consider several external and internal factors, including competitors’ strategies and prices, the overall marketing strategy and mix, and the nature of the market and demand.

Figure 10.1 suggests three major pricing strategies: customer value–based pricing, cost-based pricing, and competition-based pricing.

## Customer Value–Based Pricing

In the end, the customer will decide whether a product’s price is right. Pricing decisions, like other marketing mix decisions, must start with customer value. When customers buy a product, they exchange something of value (the price) to get something of value (the benefits of having or using the product). Effective customer-oriented pricing involves understanding how much value consumers place on the benefits they receive from the product and setting a price that captures that value.

**Customer value–based pricing** uses buyers’ perceptions of value as the key to pricing. Value-based pricing means that the marketer cannot design a product and marketing program and then set the price. Price is considered along with all other marketing mix variables *before* the marketing program is set.

**Figure 10.2** compares value-based pricing with cost-based pricing. Although costs are an important consideration in setting prices, cost-based pricing is often product driven. The company designs what it considers to be a good product, adds up the costs of making the product, and sets a price that covers costs plus a target profit. Marketing must then convince buyers that the product’s value at that price justifies its purchase. If the price turns out to be too high, the company must settle for lower markups or lower sales, both resulting in disappointing profits.

Value-based pricing reverses this process. The company first assesses customer needs and value perceptions. It then sets its target price based on customer perceptions of value. The targeted value and price drive decisions about what costs can be incurred and the resulting product design. As a result, pricing begins with analyzing consumer needs and value perceptions, and the price is set to match perceived value.

Setting price based on buyers’ perceptions of value rather than on the seller’s cost.

### Figure 10.1  
**Considerations in Setting Price**

This diagram illustrates the fundamental constraints and considerations in setting a product's price. The core structure is a range defined by a **price floor**, representing the minimum price at which a company can avoid losses, and a **price ceiling**, beyond which consumer demand ceases. Between these two limits, the optimal pricing strategy is determined by balancing **consumer perceptions of value** against the company's **product costs**. External influences, including **competition and other external factors** such as competitors' strategies and prices, as well as the company's own **marketing strategy, objectives, and mix**, and the **nature of the market and demand**, also play crucial roles in shaping the final price. The ultimate goal is to establish a price that simultaneously offers perceived value to customers and ensures profitability for the company. Value-Based Pricing versus Cost-Based Pricing
