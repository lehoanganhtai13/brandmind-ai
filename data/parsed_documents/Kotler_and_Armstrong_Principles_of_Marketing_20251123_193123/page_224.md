# Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

Then P&G further segments each detergent brand to serve even narrower niches. For example, you can buy any of dozens of versions of Tide—from Tide Original, Tide Coldwater, or Tide Pods to Tide Free & Gentle, Tide Vivid White + Bright, Tide Colorguard, Tide plus Febreze, or Tide with a Touch of Downy.

By offering product and marketing variations to segments, companies hope for higher sales and a stronger position within each market segment. Developing a stronger position within several segments creates more total sales than undifferentiated marketing across all segments. Thanks to its differentiated approach, P&G is really cleaning up in the $15 billion U.S. laundry detergent market.  
* Incredibly, by itself, the Tide family of brands captures a 38 percent share of all North American detergent sales; the Gain brand pulls in another 15 percent. Even more incredible, all P&G detergent brands combined capture a 60 percent U.S. market share.  
But differentiated marketing also increases the costs of doing business. A firm usually finds it more expensive to develop and produce, say, 10 units of 10 different products than 100 units of a single product. Developing separate marketing plans for separate segments requires extra marketing research, forecasting, sales analysis, promotion planning, and channel management. And trying to reach different market segments with different advertising campaigns increases promotion costs. Thus, the company must weigh increased sales against increased costs when deciding on a differentiated marketing strategy.

Differentiated marketing: P&G markets multiple laundry detergent brands, then further segments each brand to service even narrower niches. As a result, it’s really cleaning up in the U.S. laundry detergent market, with an almost 60 percent market share. © Torontonian / Alamy Stock Photo

## Concentrated Marketing

**Concentrated (niche) marketing**  
A market-coverage strategy in which a firm goes after a large share of one or a few segments or niches.

When using a **concentrated marketing** (or **niche marketing**) strategy, instead of going after a small share of a large market, a firm goes after a large share of one or a few smaller segments or niches.  
For example, consider nicher Stance Socks:

> “Rihanna designs them, Jay Z sings about them, and the rest of the world can’t seem to get enough of Stance socks,” says one observer. They’ve even become the official on-court sock of the NBA and a favorite of many professional players on game day. Nicher Stance sells socks and only socks. Yet it’s thriving in the shadows of much larger competitors who sell socks mostly as a sideline. Five years ago, Stance’s founders discovered socks as a large but largely overlooked and undervalued market. While walking through the sock section a local Target store, says Stance’s CEO and cofounder, Jeff Kearl, “It was like, black, white, brown, and gray—with some argyle—in plastic bags. I thought, we could totally [reinvent] socks, because everyone was ignoring them.”

> So Stance set out to breathe new life into the sock category by creating technically superior socks that also offered fun, style, and status. Mission accomplished. You’ll now find colorful displays of Stance’s comfortable but quirky socks in stores in more than 40 countries, from the local surf shop to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. Selling at prices ranging from $10 to $40 a pair, Stance sold an estimated 12 million pairs of socks last year. That’s small potatoes for giant competitors such as Hanes or Nike, but it’s nicely profitable for nicher Stance. Next up? Another often overlooked niche—Stance men’s underwear.

Through concentrated marketing, the firm achieves a strong market position because of its greater knowledge of consumer needs in the niches it serves and the special reputation it acquires. It can market more *effectively* by fine-tuning its products, prices, and programs to the needs of carefully defined segments. It can also market more *efficiently*, targeting its products or services, channels, and communications programs toward only consumers that it can serve best and most profitably.
