And these firms occupy different competitive positions in the target market.

We now examine competitive strategies based on the roles firms play in the target market—leader, challenger, follower, or nicher. Suppose that an industry contains the firms shown in

Figure 18.2 outlines competitive market positions and their associated roles, illustrating a market structure based on share percentage. The market leader, holding the largest share at 40%, focuses on expanding total demand and defending or increasing its market share. Market challengers, with 30% of the market, aim to attack the leader and gain share. Market followers, holding 20% of the market, are content to maintain their current share and avoid challenging competitors. Finally, market nichers, representing 10% of the market, target specific, profitable segments that are too small to attract major competitors. This structure highlights a hierarchy of market influence, from the dominant leader to specialized nichers, each employing distinct competitive strategies.

As you can see, 40 percent of the market is in the hands of the **market leader**, the firm with the largest market share. Another 30 percent is in the hands of **market challengers**, runner-up firms that are fighting hard to increase their market share. Another 20 percent is in the hands of **market followers**, other runner-up firms that want to hold their share without rocking the boat. The remaining 10 percent is in the hands of **market nichers**, firms that serve small segments not being pursued by other firms.

> **Market leader**  
> The firm in an industry with the largest market share.

> **Market challenger**  
> A runner-up firm that is fighting hard to increase its market share in an industry.

> **Market follower**  
> A runner-up firm that wants to hold its share in an industry without rocking the boat.

> **Market nicher**  
> A firm that serves small segments that the other firms in an industry overlook or ignore.

**Table 18.1** shows specific marketing strategies that are available to market leaders, challengers, followers, and nichers. Remember, however, that these classifications often do not apply to a whole company but only to its position in a specific industry. Large companies such as GE, Microsoft, Google, P&G, or Disney might be leaders in some markets and nichers in others. For example, Amazon leads the online retailing market but challenges Apple and Samsung in smartphones and tablets. P&G leads in many segments, such as laundry detergents and shampoo, but it challenges Unilever in hand soaps and Kimberly-Clark in facial tissues. Such companies often use different strategies for different business units or products, depending on the competitive situations of each.

## Market Leader Strategies

Most industries contain an acknowledged market leader. The leader has the largest market share and usually leads the other firms in price changes, new product introductions, distribution coverage, and promotion spending. The leader may or may not be admired or respected, but other firms concede its dominance. Competitors focus on the leader as a company to challenge, imitate, or avoid. Some of the best-known market leaders are Walmart (retailing), Amazon (online retailing), McDonald’s (fast food), Verizon (wireless), Coca-Cola (beverages), Caterpillar (earth-moving equipment), Nike (athletic footwear and apparel), Facebook (social media), and Google (internet search).

A leader’s life is not easy. It must maintain a constant watch. Other firms keep challenging its strengths or trying to take advantage of its weaknesses. The market leader can easily miss a turn in the market and plunge into second or third place. A product innovation may come along and hurt the leader (as when Netflix’s direct marketing and video streaming unseated then-market leader Blockbuster or when Apple developed the iPod and iTunes and took the market lead from Sony’s Walkman portable audio devices). The leader might grow arrogant or complacent and misjudge the competition (as when Sears lost its lead to Walmart). Or the leader might look old-fashioned against new and peppier rivals (as when Abercrombie & Fitch lost ground to stylish or lower-cost brands such as Zara, H&M, and Forever 21).

To remain number one, leading firms can take any of three actions. First, they can find ways to expand total demand. Second, they can protect their current market share through good defensive and offensive actions. Third, they can try to expand their market share further, even if market size remains constant.

### Expanding Total Demand

The leading firm normally gains the most when the total market expands. If Americans eat more fast food, McDonald’s stands to gain the most because it holds a much larger fast-food market share than competitors such as Subway, Burger King, or Taco Bell. If McDonald’s can convince more Americans that fast food is the best eating-out choice, it will benefit more than its competitors.
