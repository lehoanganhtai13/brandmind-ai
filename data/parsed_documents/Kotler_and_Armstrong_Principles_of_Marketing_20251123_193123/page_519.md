Similarly, while perusing your favorite backpacking site, you might see an attention-grabbing video ad from The North Face. Roll over the brand logo and up pops an interactive ad panel, with the video continuing in the upper-right corner alongside information on featured products and real-time links to The North Face website and a store locator. Such dynamic ads can engage consumers and deliver substantial impact.¹⁰

Using *search-related ads* (or *contextual advertising*), text- and image-based ads and links appear atop or alongside search engine results on sites such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. For example, search Google for “LED TVs.” At the top and side of the resulting search list, you’ll see inconspicuous ads for 10 or more advertisers, ranging from Samsung and Panasonic to Best Buy, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Crutchfield, and CDW. Almost 90 percent of Google’s $74.5 billion in revenues last year came from ad sales. Search is an always-on kind of medium, and the results are easily measured.¹¹

A search advertiser buys search terms from the search site and pays only if consumers click through to its site. For instance, enter “Coke” or “Coca-Cola” or even just “soft drinks” or “rewards” into your search engine and almost without fail “My Coke Rewards” comes up as one of the top options, perhaps along with a display ad and link to Coca-Cola’s official Google+ page. This is no coincidence. Coca-Cola supports its popular online loyalty program largely through search buys. The soft drink giant started first with traditional TV and print advertising but quickly learned that search was the most effective way to bring consumers to its www.mycokerewards.com web or mobile site to register. Now, any of dozens of purchased search terms will return mycokerewards.com at or near the top of the search list.

### Email Marketing

**Email marketing** remains an important and growing digital marketing tool. “Social media is the hot new thing,” says one observer, “but email is still the king.”¹² Around the world, more than 200 million emails are sent out every minute of every day. According to one account, 72 percent of adults prefer that companies communicate with them via email, and 91 percent say they like receiving promotional emails from companies with which they do business. What’s more, email is no longer limited to PCs; 66 percent of all emails are now opened on mobile devices. Not surprisingly, 25 percent of companies in one survey say that email is their top channel in terms of return on investment.¹³

When used properly, email can be the ultimate direct marketing medium. Today’s emails are anything but the staid, text-only messages of the past. Instead, they are colorful, inviting, and interactive. Email lets marketers send highly targeted, tightly personalized, relationship-building messages. For example, toymaker Fisher-Price uses email to send timely check-ins, updates, and birthday wishes to subscribers. A mother might receive a colorful, personalized “happy birthday to your baby” email on her child’s first birthday that contains links to age-related playtime ideas, parenting tips, and product information.¹⁴

Similarly, eyewear brand Warby Parker sends a sequence of nine informational and promotional emails to home try-on customers. Each is personally addressed and keyed to steps in the trial process, from initial registration and order confirmation to offers of selection assistance and instructions for returning frames. “The magical part was feeling like Warby Parker was right there with me throughout the process,” says one customer. Warby Parker also sends cheerful after-purchase follow-up and announcement emails. For example, it sends personalized emails to customers on the first anniversary of their purchase, with the message “You’ve had your Warby Parker frames for one year now. Tell ’em we said Happy Birthday! We hope the first 365 days have been joyful.” And just in case the customer wants “to start more traditions,” the email also includes a link to Warby Parker’s website.¹⁵ But there’s a dark side to the growing use of email marketing.
