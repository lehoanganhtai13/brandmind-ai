# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

Truly innovative companies do not rely only on one source for new product ideas.

## OBJECTIVE 9-2  
**List and define the steps in the new product development process and the major considerations in managing this process.**  
*(pp 281–289)*

The new product development process consists of eight sequential stages. The process starts with *idea generation*. Next comes *idea screening*, which reduces the number of ideas based on the company’s own criteria. Ideas that pass the screening stage continue through *product concept development*, in which a detailed version of the new product idea is stated in meaningful consumer terms. This stage includes *concept testing*, in which new product concepts are tested with a group of target consumers to determine whether the concepts have strong consumer appeal. Strong concepts proceed to *marketing strategy development*, in which an initial marketing strategy for the new product is developed from the product concept. In the *business-analysis* stage, a review of the sales, costs, and profit projections for a new product is conducted to determine whether the new product is likely to satisfy the company’s objectives. With positive results here, the ideas become more concrete through *product development* and *test marketing* and finally are launched during *commercialization*.

New product development involves more than just going through a set of steps. Companies must take a systematic, holistic approach to managing this process. Successful new product development requires a customer-centered, team-based, systematic effort.

## OBJECTIVE 9-3  
**Describe the stages of the product life cycle and how marketing strategies change during a product’s life cycle.**  
*(pp 289–297)*

Each product has a *life cycle* marked by a changing set of problems and opportunities. The sales of the typical product follow an S-shaped curve made up of five stages. The cycle begins with the *product development* stage in which the company finds and develops a new product idea. The *introduction stage* is marked by slow growth and low profits as the product is distributed to the market. If successful, the product enters a *growth stage*, which offers rapid sales growth and increasing profits. Next comes a *maturity stage* in which the product’s sales growth slows down and profits stabilize. Finally, the product enters a *decline stage* in which sales and profits dwindle. The company’s task during this stage is to recognize the decline and decide whether it should maintain, harvest, or drop the product. The different stages of the PLC require different marketing strategies and tactics.

## OBJECTIVE 9-4  
**Discuss two additional product issues: socially responsible product decisions and international product and services marketing.**  
*(pp 297–299)*

Marketers must consider two additional product issues. The first is *social responsibility*. This includes public policy issues and regulations involving acquiring or dropping products, patent protection, product quality and safety, and product warranties. The second involves the special challenges facing international product and services marketers. International marketers must decide how much to standardize or adapt their offerings for world markets.
