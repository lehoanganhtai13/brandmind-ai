# Marketing by the Numbers  
## Pop-Tarts Gone Nutty!

The new product includes flavors such as peanut butter and chocolate peanut butter. Although the new Gone Nutty! product will reap a higher wholesale price for the company ($1.20 per eight-count package of the new product versus $1.00 per package for the original product), it also comes with higher variable costs ($0.55 per eight-count package for the new product versus $0.30 per eight-count package for the original product).

**8-13**  
What brand development strategy is Kellogg undertaking? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

**8-14**  
Assume the company expects to sell 5 million packages of Pop-Tarts Gone Nutty! in the first year after introduction but expects that 80 percent of those sales will come from buyers who would normally purchase existing Pop-Tart flavors (that is, cannibalized sales). Assuming the sales of regular Pop-Tarts are normally 300 million packages per year and that the company will incur an increase in fixed costs of $500,000 during the first year to launch Gone Nutty!, will the new product be profitable for the company? Refer to the discussion of cannibalization in Appendix 2: Marketing by the Numbers for an explanation regarding how to conduct this analysis. (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning)

# Video Case  
## Plymouth Rock Assurance

Plymouth Rock Assurance is an insurance company with a branding tale to tell. What started as a single Massachusetts-based auto insurance company in the early 1980s quickly grew into a group of separate companies that write and manage property and casualty insurance in various states. To streamline operations, cut costs, and better serve customers, the company undertook a rebranding process to combine three distinct auto insurance brands—Plymouth Rock, High Point, and Palisades—into one.

Rather than remaking the brand overnight, the company carried out a gradual transformation that retained existing brand equity and put customers’ minds at ease. With Plymouth Rock as the parent brand and High Point and Palisades as sub-brands, the company transitioned the three into a single brand in incremental steps.

After viewing the video featuring Plymouth Rock Assurance, answer the following questions:

Describe the process that Plymouth Rock Assurance used to rebrand the company. How does this process differ from other options it could have pursued?

# Company Case  
## Airbnb: Making Hospitality Authentic

Like many services industries, hotel companies have done a tremendous job of ensuring the quality of the customer experience through standardization. People booking rooms through any of the major hotel chains can be pretty much assured of certain basics. They’ll enter the 13-by-25-foot room into a short hallway with a bathroom and closet on one side or the other. In the bathroom, they’ll find the basics along with a sterile display of soaps, hair care products, and other toiletries. The room features a bed or two flanked on both sides by nightstands with a reading light by each. An upholstered chair and ottoman sit at an angle in the far corner with a desk opposite. A dresser topped with a flatscreen TV sits across from the foot of the bed. Visitors might also discover a mini-fridge and a microwave oven.

The artwork and décor are fairly contemporary although impersonal and nondescript. Other details throughout the hotel property are equally predictable. And although luxury level across these features varies from chain to chain, the vibe is the same. Many travelers count on this standard experience—it assures that their experience will be within a set of narrow, expected boundaries. Minimizing the risk of negative outcomes typically results in a satisfactory lodging experience for most guests most of the time.

But one lodging provider is targeting travelers who have a different set of needs and expectations. Airbnb is turning lodging services upside down by promising a hospitality experience that is the complete opposite of the one provided by major hotel chains. A major player in the new sharing economy, Airbnb is an online community marketplace that connects people who want to rent out space in their homes with those who are looking for accommodations. Like a true online marketplace, Airbnb doesn’t own any lodging properties.
