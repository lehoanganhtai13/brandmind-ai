# 6.2 GE: A Model for B-to-B Digital and Social Media Marketing

Few brands are more familiar than GE. For more than 130 years, we’ve packed our homes with GE products—from good ol’ GE lightbulbs to refrigerators, ranges, clothes washers and dryers, microwave ovens, and hundreds of other products bearing the familiar GE script logo. But here’s a fact that might startle you. Less than a meager 8 percent of GE’s $117 billion in annual sales comes from consumer products.

The vast majority of the company’s sales comes from industrial products and services across a wide range of energy, transportation, and health-care industries. Far beyond lightbulbs and appliances, GE sells everything from jet aircraft engines, giant wind turbines, and diesel locomotives to water processing systems and high-tech medical imaging equipment. GE bills itself as an “industrial infrastructure company,” one that’s on a mission to “invent the next industrial era, to build, move, power, and cure the world.”

Jet engines? Diesel locomotives? Power turbines? Yawn. To many people, “industrial” translates to “dull.” It’s hardly the fodder for stimulating digital and social media content. But GE doesn’t see it that way. GE has a brand story to tell—a story of big, bad machines and innovative technologies that are changing the world and how we live in it. And it sees digital as an ideal platform for sharing that story. As a result, GE has become a model for B-to-B use of digital and social media.

At a core level, GE covers the digital basics well through a wide variety of platforms that inform and engage business customers directly, connect them with GE salespeople, and promote customer purchasing and relationships. For example, GE’s various divisions—from GE Aviation to GE Healthcare and GE Energy—offer dozens of industry-specific websites, containing thousands of individual site areas and tens of thousands of pages that provide B-to-B customers with purchasing solutions, product overviews, detailed technical information, online videos and webinars, live chats, and real-time customer support.

GE also helps its sales force engage business customers more deeply through a comprehensive presence in major social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Salesforce.com, and even Instagram, Pinterest, and Vine. “We have a core belief that business is social,” says GE’s chief marketing officer (CMO). “If you’re in business you need social because it’s going to get you closer to your customers. We want to get our sales team 100 percent digitized.”

But GE’s most inspired use of digital and social media goes well beyond the basics of engaging and supporting customers directly. GE also uses digital platforms to reach out to other important publics. “The more people know GE, the more they like GE,” says the company’s director of global media. “So our [digital] content strategy is about uncovering and telling great stories about innovation, technology, big data, developing healthcare, and so on. We want our customers, our shareholders, our employees to know what GE thinks about the world,” a task ideally suited to digital and social media. The goal is to make the GE brand relevant, contemporary, and accessible. “No one remembers product specs and features. But a great story well told hits home,” says GE’s CMO. “Compelling stories bring a brand to life—they make us relevant, poignant, vibrant, droll, and hopefully memorable.”

To that end, over the past several years, GE has unleashed a remarkable array of digital content that connects the brand with consumers and positions the 130-year-old company as a youthful, contemporary technology leader in the new digital industrial era. For example, one of GE’s first and most successful social media campaigns was #sixsecondscience, a program launched on Vine asking people to share their favorite science experiments in video clips of six seconds or less. The campaign drew in 400 videos in a week, including demonstrations of everything from how to make a volcano using a pile of sand, vinegar, and baking soda to a homemade Tesla coil in action. The Vine campaign won awards and accolades. More important, it got people to spend time with the GE brand.

You’ll find GE actively engaged on all the major social media. For example, GE’s numerous Pinterest, Tumblr, and Instagram sites introduce tech enthusiasts to the raw beauty of the company’s innovative industrial products and technologies. “I love our Instagram feed,” says the CMO. “It shows the majesty and scale of our big machines. It’s GE at our badass best.” In fact, the very first board at the GE Pinterest site is “Badass Machines.” Others include “From the Factory Floor,” “Minds and Machines,” and “Brilliant Machines.”

This table presents a collection of eight images, all categorized under the overarching theme of "Badass Machines." The images are arranged in a two-by-four grid, suggesting a comparative or illustrative display rather than a sequential process. Each individual image likely depicts a distinct example of a powerful or impressive machine, with no explicit hierarchical relationships or functional connections indicated between them. The presentation implies a visual showcase of various "badass machines," allowing for individual appreciation of each depicted item without a prescribed order or dependency.

**Through its inspired use of digital and social media, industrial powerhouse GE engages customers and keeps the GE brand relevant, contemporary, and accessible to important publics in today’s digital industrial era.**  
GE GE also publishes an innovative daily online B-to-B blog, called GE Reports, which features science fiction–like stories on topics such as moon power, digital pathology, and 3D printing done by hand.
