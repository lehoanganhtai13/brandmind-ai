Core, actual, and augmented product: People who buy an iPad are buying much more than a tablet computer. They are buying entertainment, self-expression, productivity, and connectivity—a mobile and personal window to the world. Betsie Van der Meer/Getty Images

> consumers seek. A woman buying lipstick buys more than lip color. Charles Revson of Revlon saw this early: “In the factory, we make cosmetics; in the store, we sell hope.” 🔵 And people who buy an Apple iPad are buying much more than just a tablet computer. They are buying entertainment, self-expression, productivity, and connectivity with friends and family—a mobile and personal window to the world.

> At the second level, product planners must turn the core benefit into an *actual product*. They need to develop product and service features, a design, a quality level, a brand name, and packaging. For example, the iPad is an actual product. Its name, parts, styling, operating system, features, packaging, and other attributes have all been carefully combined to deliver the core customer value of staying connected.

> Finally, product planners must build an *augmented product* around the core benefit and actual product by offering additional consumer services and benefits. The iPad is more than just a digital device. It provides consumers with a complete connectivity solution. Thus, when consumers buy an iPad, Apple and its resellers also might give buyers a warranty on parts and workmanship, quick repair services when needed, and web and mobile sites to use if they have problems or questions. Apple also provides access to a huge assortment of apps and accessories, along with an iCloud service that integrates buyers’ photos, music, documents, apps, calendars, contacts, and other content across all of their devices from any location.

> Consumers see products as complex bundles of benefits that satisfy their needs. When developing products, marketers first must identify the *core customer value* that consumers seek from the product. They must then design the *actual* product and find ways to *augment* it to create customer value and a full and satisfying brand experience.

## Product and Service Classifications

Products and services fall into two broad classes based on the types of consumers who use them: *consumer products* and *industrial products*. Broadly defined, products also include other marketable entities such as experiences, organizations, persons, places, and ideas.

### Consumer Products

**Consumer products** are products and services bought by final consumers for personal consumption. Marketers usually classify these products and services further based on how consumers go about buying them. Consumer products include *convenience products*, *shopping products*, *specialty products*, and *unsought products*. These products differ in the ways consumers buy them and, therefore, in how they are marketed (see 🔵 Table 8.1).

**Convenience products** are consumer products and services that customers usually buy frequently, immediately, and with minimal comparison and buying effort. Examples include laundry detergent, candy, magazines, and fast food. Convenience products are usually low priced, and marketers place them in many locations to make them readily available when customers need or want them.

**Shopping products** are less frequently purchased consumer products and services that customers compare carefully on suitability, quality, price, and style. When buying shopping products and services, consumers spend much time and effort in gathering information and making comparisons. Examples include furniture, clothing, major appliances, and hotel services. Shopping product marketers usually distribute their products through fewer outlets but provide deeper sales support to help customers in their comparison efforts.

This table outlines a classification of consumer products, differentiating them based on purchasing behavior and effort. A **Consumer product** is defined as an item acquired by end-users for personal use. Within this category, **Convenience products** are characterized by frequent, immediate purchases with minimal deliberation or effort. In contrast, **Shopping products** require customers to engage in a comparison process, evaluating attributes like suitability, quality, price, and style before making a selection and purchase. This structure presents a hierarchical breakdown of consumer goods, moving from the general definition to more specific types defined by customer engagement levels. A consumer product with unique characteristics or brand identification for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchase effort.
