# Chapter 1 | Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement

Despite their rebounding means, consumers continue to buy less, clip more coupons, swipe their credit cards less, and put more in the bank.

Many consumers are reconsidering their very definition of the good life. “People are finding happiness in old-fashioned virtues—thrift, savings, do-it-yourself projects, self-improvement, hard work, faith, and community,” says one consumer behavior expert. “We are moving from mindless to mindful consumption.”[^34] The new, more frugal spending values don’t mean that people have resigned themselves to lives of deprivation. As the economy has improved, consumers are again indulging in luxuries and bigger-ticket purchases, just more sensibly.

In response, companies in all industries—from discounters such as Target to luxury brands such as Lexus—have realigned their marketing strategies with the new economic realities. More than ever, marketers are emphasizing the *value* in their value propositions. They are focusing on value for the money, practicality, and durability in their product offerings and marketing pitches.

For example, for years discount retailer Target focused increasingly on the “Expect More” side of its “Expect More. Pay Less.” value proposition. Its carefully cultivated “upscale-discounter” image successfully differentiated it from Walmart’s more hard-nosed “lowest-price” position. But when the economy soured, many consumers worried that Target’s trendier assortments and hip marketing also meant higher prices. So Target has shifted its balance more toward the “Pay Less” half of the slogan, making certain that its prices are in line with Walmart’s and that customers know it. Although still trendy, Target’s marketing now emphasizes more practical price and savings appeals. Offering “more for your money” holds a prominent place in the Target mission. “We think a lot about your budget and how to give you the best value every time you shop with us,” says the company.[^35]

In adjusting to the new economy, companies may be tempted to cut their marketing budgets and slash prices in an effort to coax customers into opening their wallets. However, although cutting costs and offering selected discounts can be important marketing tactics, smart marketers understand that making cuts in the wrong places can damage long-term brand images and customer relationships. The challenge is to balance the brand’s value proposition with the current times while also enhancing its long-term equity. Thus, rather than slashing prices in uncertain economic times, many marketers hold the line on prices and instead explain why their brands are worth it.

## The Growth of Not-for-Profit Marketing

In recent years, marketing has also become a major part of the strategies of many not-for-profit organizations, such as colleges, hospitals, museums, zoos, symphony orchestras, foundations, and even churches. The nation’s not-for-profits face stiff competition for support and membership. Sound marketing can help them attract membership, funds, and support.

For example, not-for-profit St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has a special mission: “Finding cures. Saving children.” It directly serves some 7,800 patients each year plus countless thousands more through its affiliations and clinical trials in places across the country and around the world. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude, for treatment, travel, housing, or food. To accomplish this mission, St. Jude raises the funds for its $2.4 million daily operating budget through powerhouse marketing.[^36] Fundraising efforts include everything from public service announcements, celebrity endorsements, corporate partnerships, and an extensive online presence to events such as Trike-a-thons, Math-a-thons, an Up ’Til Dawn student challenge, and the St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway. St. Jude’s works with more than 70 corporate partners such as Target, Domino’s, Williams-Sonoma,
