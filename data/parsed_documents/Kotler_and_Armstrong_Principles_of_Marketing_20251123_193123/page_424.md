# Engaging Consumers and Communicating Customer Value

The brand needed a new creative concept—something that would rejuvenate Snickers and broaden its market appeal. Rather than abandoning its established positioning, however, Mars extended it with the fresh new “You’re not you when you’re hungry” theme. So while “Snickers satisfies” remains the brand’s baseline positioning, “You’re not you” is the creative “big idea” that now brings the positioning to life in a clever and engaging way.

“You’re not you when you’re hungry” taps into a powerful and universal emotional appeal—**hunger**. It reaches a broad market. Almost everyone can relate to how being hungry changes who you are. The positioning is as powerful for women as for men; for older generations as for younger ones; for office workers, factory workers, or students. It works across global cultural lines. Finally, the “You’re not you” theme lends itself to no end of imaginative and entertaining ads and executions across varied media platforms.

From that first Betty White Super Bowl ad, the “You’re not you” campaign has spawned a host of creative ads in more than 80 countries. One memorable TV ad featured the late Robin Williams as a football coach instructing his team to “kill them—with kindness” by making balloon animals and tea cosies. Then there was the Snickers *Brady Bunch* ad for Super Bowl XLIX in which roughneck Danny Trejo portrayed a snarling Marcia and quirky Steve Buscemi played a disgruntled Jan. That ad ranked third-highest among that year’s Super Bowl ads in terms of earned impressions and went on to win a first-ever Super Clio (the Academy Awards of advertising). During Super Bowl 50, another Snickers ad mimicked the iconic photo shoot featuring Marilyn Monroe in a white dress standing over a breezy subway grate—only this time, the updraft revealed grumpy-faced Willem Dafoe’s bony legs and tighty-whiteys. That ad pulled in more than 11 million views on the Snickers YouTube channel alone.

The “You’re not you” campaign also works well in print. One print ad shows three sprinters in start position on a track, one of them facing the wrong direction. Another shows four soccer players in position to block a free kick, all with their cupped hands protecting important body parts save one who is unguarded, hands above his head with his jersey pulled over his face. Still another ad gets the point across without using humans at all. In a reversal of roles, it shows a zebra in hot pursuit of a lion. Each simple visual is accompanied by a cross-section of a Snickers bar and the phrase “You’re not you when you’re hungry. Snickers satisfies.”

Beyond TV and print ads, the “You’re not you” campaign is fully integrated across a range of digital, mobile, positional, and other media, even packaging. Snickers’s current “Hunger Bar” wrappers directly reinforce the campaign message, with labels containing mood descriptors such as Cranky, Loopy, Spacey, Whiny, Snippy, Curmudgeon, Goofball, and Drama Mama. Snickers urges customers to call out contrarian-acting friends with an appropriately labeled Snickers bar. Mars even created a clever two-minute mini-reality show video highlighting a Snickers hotline operator who dispatches bike messengers to deliver the wrappers to deserving candidates.

The Snickers “You’re not you when you’re hungry” campaign’s numerous digital elements are designed to engage customers and trigger consumer-generated content. For example, a recent “Snap a Selfie with your Snickers Bar” contest invites the brand’s more than 11 million Facebook followers to share photos of “who R U when U R hungry”—the winner will receive $100,000 and his or her own personalized Snickers bars. A Snickers “You’re Not YouTube” campaign signed up 13 influential YouTubers, with a combined following of 7 million subscribers, to illustrate their own “You’re not you” moments. Snickers also ran a YouTube contest inviting fans to submit their own photos, videos, or memes and to share them socially with #EatASnickers.

In yet another digital campaign, this one in the United Kingdom, British celebrities posted four “out-of-character” tweets—such as professional soccer player Rio Ferdinand tweeting “Really getting into knitting!!!” or glamor model Katie Price tweeting “Large scale quantitative easing could distort liquidity of government bond market”—followed by a fifth tweet promoting Snickers bars and quoting the campaign slogan #yourenotyouwhenyourehungry. Such digital efforts effectively engage and entertain the brand’s digitally savvy fans while reinforcing the Snickers mantra.
