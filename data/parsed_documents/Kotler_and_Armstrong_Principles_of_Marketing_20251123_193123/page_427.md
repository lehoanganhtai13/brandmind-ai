more). Just as mass marketing once gave rise to a new generation of mass-media communications, the new digital and social media have given birth to a more targeted, social, and engaging marketing communications model.

Although network television, magazines, newspapers, and other traditional mass media remain very important, their dominance is declining. In their place, advertisers are now adding a broad selection of more-specialized and highly targeted media to engage smaller customer communities with more personalized, interactive content. The new media range from specialty cable television channels and made-for-the-web videos to online ads, email and texting, blogs, mobile catalogs and coupons, and a burgeoning list of social media. Such new media have taken marketing by storm.

Some advertising industry experts even predict that the old mass-media communications model will eventually become obsolete. Mass-media costs are rising, audiences are shrinking, ad clutter is increasing, and viewers are gaining control of message exposure through technologies such as video streaming or DVRs that let them skip disruptive television commercials. As a result, the skeptics suggest, marketers are shifting ever-larger portions of their marketing budgets away from old-media mainstays and moving them to online, social, mobile, and other new-age media.

In recent years, although TV remains a potent advertising medium that captures a third or more of total advertising spending, its growth has slowed or declined. Ad spending in magazines, newspapers, and radio has also lost ground. Meanwhile, spending in digital media has surged. Growing at a rate of 15 percent a year, total digital ad spending is expected to pass TV spending this year. By 2020, digital media will capture an estimated 45 percent of all ad spending compared with TV’s 33 percent. By far the fastest-growing digital category is mobile, which grew 38 percent last year and will account for an estimated 74 percent of all digital ad spending by 2020.

More and more, large advertisers—from Nike and P&G to Unilever—are moving toward a “digital-first” approach to building their brands. For example, Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, now spends as much as one-quarter of its $8 billion global marketing budget on digital media. In countries such as the United States and China, digital media account for closer to 50 percent of its marketing budget.³

Some marketers now rely almost entirely on digital and social media. ● For example, eco-friendly household products maker Method employs a full but mostly digital promotional campaign themed “Clean happy”:⁴

> Method is known for offbeat campaigns using slogans like “People against dirty” and “For the love of clean.” But the most notable thing about the “Clean happy” campaign is that it at first used zero ads in traditional media like TV or magazines. Instead, the centerpiece of the campaign was brand videos aired only on YouTube and on the Method Facebook page. The campaign also employed online media ads as well as a major presence in social media that included, in addition to YouTube and Facebook, the Method Twitter feed and blogs. The “Clean happy” campaign fit both Method’s personality and its budget. Method is the kind of grassroots brand that benefits from social media–type word of mouth. Moreover, “Clean happy” ran a first-year budget of only about $3.5 million, compared with the whopping $150 million or so that rival P&G might spend just to bring out a single new product, such as Tide Pods detergent packets.

> Method ran the digital-only campaign for a full year before beginning to bring it to TV. Even now, the “Clean happy” campaign relies heavily on digital and social media, supported only by carefully targeted regional cable TV in selected markets. More recent campaign installments include “Life’s Messy Moments,” a romantic comedy–style series of TV and online ads and other social media content that follow a young couple and their relatable messes from their first kiss to first kid to a clean, happy ending. To kick off the campaign on Facebook, Method hosted a photo contest called Clean Happy Awards, asking fans to submit their best pet, kid, and party messes. “We’re embracing this grassroots movement,” says a Method ad executive. “When you don’t have 150 million bucks, that’s what you have to do.”
