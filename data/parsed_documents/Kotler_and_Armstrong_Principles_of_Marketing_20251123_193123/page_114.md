# Chapter 3 | Analyzing the Marketing Environment

However, even when people are together, they are often “alone together”—immersed in their own little bubbles, intensely connected to tiny screens and keyboards.

This new way of interacting strongly affects how companies market their brands and communicate with customers. Consumers increasingly tap digitally into networks of friends and online brand communities to learn about and buy products and to shape and share brand experiences. As a result, it is important for brands to participate in these networks too.

## People’s Views of Organizations

People vary in their attitudes toward corporations, government agencies, trade unions, universities, and other organizations. By and large, people are willing to work for major organizations and expect them, in turn, to carry out society’s work.

The past two decades have seen a sharp decrease in confidence in and loyalty toward America’s business and political organizations and institutions. In the workplace, there has been an overall decline in organizational loyalty. Waves of company downsizings bred cynicism and distrust. In just the past decade, major corporate scandals, rounds of layoffs resulting from the Great Recession, the financial meltdown triggered by Wall Street bankers’ greed and incompetence, and other unsettling activities have resulted in a further loss of confidence in big business. Many people today see work not as a source of satisfaction but as a required chore to earn money to enjoy their nonwork hours. This trend suggests that organizations need to find new ways to win consumer and employee confidence.

## People’s Views of Society

People vary in their attitudes toward their society—patriots defend it, reformers want to change it, and malcontents want to leave it. People’s orientation to their society influences their consumption patterns and attitudes toward the marketplace.

American patriotism has been increasing gradually for the past two decades. One annual consumer survey shows that some brands are highly associated with patriotism, such as Jeep, Coca-Cola, Disney, Levi Strauss, Harley-Davidson, Gillette, and Apple. Marketers respond with renewed “Made in America” pitches and ads with patriotic themes. For example, last summer Coca-Cola launched a limited-edition red, white, and blue flag can surrounding the July 4 holiday with the patriotic song lyric “I’m proud to be an American” on the label. Apple recently kicked off a $100 million “Made in America” push with the introduction of a new high-end Mac Pro personal computer. The Mac Pro, “the most powerful Mac ever,” is built in Austin, Texas, with components made domestically. And Jeep’s recent patriotic “Portraits” Super Bowl ad—which featured famous and ordinary faces of Americans who’ve driven Jeeps through 75 years of wars, peace, boom times, and bust—resonated strongly with Americans. “We don’t make Jeep,” concludes the ad, “you do.”[^47]

Although most such marketing efforts are tasteful and well received, waving the red, white, and blue can sometimes prove tricky. Flag-waving promotions can be viewed as corny or as token attempts to cash in on the nation’s emotions. For example, some critics note that, so far, Apple’s “Made in America” push hasn’t had much real impact. The Mac Pro contributes less than 1 percent of Apple’s total revenues. More than 70 percent of the company’s revenues come from its iPhone and iPad products, both built in China. Marketers must take care when appealing to patriotism and other strong national emotions.

## People’s Views of Nature

People vary in their attitudes toward the natural world—some feel ruled by it, others feel in harmony with it, and still others seek to master it. A long-term trend has been people’s growing mastery over nature through technology and the belief that nature is bountiful. More recently, however, people have recognized that nature is finite and fragile; it can be destroyed or spoiled by human activities.

This renewed love of things natural has created a sizable market of consumers who seek out everything from natural, organic, and nutritional products to fuel-efficient cars.
