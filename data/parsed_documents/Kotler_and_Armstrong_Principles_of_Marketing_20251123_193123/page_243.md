# 8 Products, Services, and Brands  
## Building Customer Value

After examining customer value–driven marketing strategy, we now take a deeper look at the marketing mix: the tactical tools that marketers use to implement their strategies, engage customers, and deliver superior customer value. In this and the next chapter, we will study how companies develop and manage products, services, and brands. Then, in the chapters that follow, we look at pricing, distribution, and marketing communication tools. The product and brand are usually the first and most basic marketing consideration. We start with a seemingly simple question: What *is* a product? As it turns out, the answer is not so simple.

To dig a little deeper into the question of what is a product, we begin by looking at GoPro. You may never have heard of GoPro, the fast-growing company that makes tiny, wearable HD video cameras. Yet few brands can match the avid enthusiasm and loyalty that GoPro has created in the hearts and minds of its customers. GoPro knows that, deep down, its products are much more than just durable little cameras. More than that, it gives customers a way to share action-charged moments and emotions with friends.

## GOPRO: Be a HERO

An ever-growing army of GoPro customers are now strapping amazing little GoPro cameras to their bodies or mounting them on anything from the front bumpers of race cars to the heels of skydiving boots in order to capture the extreme moments of their lives and lifestyles. Then they can’t wait to share those emotion-packed GoPro moments with friends. In fact, the chances are good that you’ve seen many GoPro-created videos on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram or even on TV.

Maybe it’s the video shot by the skier who sets off an avalanche in the Swiss Alps and escapes by parachuting off a cliff—that amateur video received 2.6 million YouTube views in nine months. Or maybe you saw the one where a seagull picks up a tourist’s camera and takes off with it, capturing a bird’s-eye view of a castle in Cannes, France (3 million views in seven months). Or what about the video of the mountain biker in Africa who is ambushed by a full-grown gazelle (more than 13 million views in four months)? One video in which a tech-challenged Irishman used his son’s GoPro to capture his entire Las Vegas vacation with the camera mistakenly pointed at himself instead of the sights snared 6.9 million views in only six days.

> **GoPro’s success comes from a deep-down understanding that it’s selling much more than just tiny, wearable sports-action video cameras. GoPro helps people capture, share, and celebrate with others the most meaningful experiences in their lives.**

GoPro’s avid customers have become evangelists for the brand. GoPro holds a 47.5 percent share of the action camera market. Its sales soared to more than $1.4 billion last year, a fivefold increase in only four years.

What makes GoPro so successful? Part of the formula is the physical product itself: GoPro cameras are marvels of technology, especially given their affordable starting price of less than $200 for an entry-level model. A GoPro HD video camera looks like little more than a small gray box. But the lightweight, wearable or mountable GoPro is extremely versatile, and it packs amazing power for capturing stunning HD-quality video. A removable housing makes GoPro cameras waterproof to depths of 130 feet. And GoPro cameras are drop-proof from 3,000 feet (so claims one skydiver).

But GoPro knows that it sells much more than just a small metal box that takes action videos. GoPro users—whether extreme sports enthusiasts or just everyday video buffs—don’t just want to take videos. More than that, they want to tell the stories and share the emotions and moments in their lives. “Enabling you to share your life through incredible photos and video is what we do,” says GoPro. We “help people capture and share their lives’ most meaningful experiences with others—to celebrate them together.”
