However, a company doesn’t need to have over-the-top service to create customer delight. For example, no-frills grocery chain ALDI has highly satisfied customers, even though they have to bag their own groceries and can’t use credit cards. ALDI’s everyday very low pricing on good-quality products delights customers and keeps them coming back. Thus, customer satisfaction comes not just from service heroics but from how well a company delivers on its basic value proposition and helps customers solve their buying problems. “Most customers don’t want to be ‘wowed,’” says one marketing consultant. “They [just] want an effortless experience.”[^15]

Although a customer-centered firm seeks to deliver high customer satisfaction relative to competitors, it does not attempt to *maximize* customer satisfaction. A company can always increase customer satisfaction by lowering its prices or increasing its services. But this may result in lower profits. Thus, the purpose of marketing is to generate customer value profitably. This requires a very delicate balance: The marketer must continue to generate more customer value and satisfaction but not “give away the house.”

### Customer Relationship Levels and Tools

Companies can build customer relationships at many levels, depending on the nature of the target market. At one extreme, a company with many low-margin customers may seek to develop *basic relationships* with them. For example, P&G’s Tide detergent does not phone or call on all of its consumers to get to know them personally. Instead, Tide creates engagement and relationships through product experiences, brand-building advertising, websites, and social media. At the other extreme, in markets with few customers and high margins, sellers want to create *full partnerships* with key customers. For example, P&G sales representatives work closely with Walmart, Kroger, and other large retailers that sell Tide. In between these two extremes, other levels of customer relationships are appropriate.

Beyond offering consistently high value and satisfaction, marketers can use specific marketing tools to develop stronger bonds with customers. For example, many companies offer *frequency marketing programs* that reward customers who buy frequently or in large amounts. Airlines offer frequent-flier programs, hotels give room upgrades to frequent guests, and supermarkets give patronage discounts to “very important customers.”

These days almost every brand has a loyalty rewards program. Such programs can enhance and strengthen a customer’s brand experience. For example, Hilton’s HHonors loyalty program offers the usual ability to earn points redeemable for free stays or upgrades (anywhere, anytime, with no blackout dates) but also for flights (e.g., points can be converted into miles for flight bookings). More importantly, the member-exclusive HHonors smartphone app allows travelers to personalize their stay. It offers functionalities like an eCheck-in or the selection of on-property benefits (such as pillows or snacks) prior to arrival. Travelers can pick their room of choice before their stay, either from a digital floor plan or by choosing their room’s view with Google maps. The app also serves as
