# Chapter 6 | Business Markets and Business Buyer Behavior

## FIGURE 6.1  
A Model of Business Buyer Behavior

This table outlines a model of buyer behavior, depicting the interplay between external stimuli, the characteristics of the buying organization, and the resulting buyer responses. The environment is categorized into marketing stimuli, encompassing product, price, place, and promotion, and other stimuli, including economic, technological, political, cultural, and competitive factors. These environmental influences are presented as inputs that interact with the buying organization. The buying organization itself is implicitly understood to process these stimuli, though its internal components are not detailed in this specific table. The ultimate outcome of this interaction is the buyer responses, which represent the actions taken by the organization as a result of the environmental inputs and internal processing. The structure suggests a stimulus-response framework, where external factors trigger a decision-making process within the organization, leading to observable responses.

This table outlines the key elements of the buying center and the buying decision process. The buying center encompasses individuals and groups involved in the purchase decision. The buying decision process is influenced by both interpersonal and individual factors, as well as broader organizational influences. This structure suggests a multi-faceted approach to understanding how purchasing decisions are made, considering both the human element within the buying center and the contextual factors of the organization.

> In some ways, business markets are similar to consumer markets—this model looks a lot like the model of consumer buyer behavior presented in Figure 5.1. But there are some major differences, especially in the nature of the buying unit, the types of decisions made, and the decision process.

### Straight rebuy  
A business buying situation in which the buyer routinely reorders something without modifications.

### Modified rebuy  
A business buying situation in which the buyer wants to modify product specifications, prices, terms, or suppliers.

### New task  
A business buying situation in which the buyer purchases a product or service for the first time.

### Systems selling (or solutions selling)  
Buying a packaged solution to a problem from a single seller, thus avoiding all the separate decisions involved in a complex buying situation.

## Major Types of Buying Situations

There are three major types of buying situations. In a **straight rebuy**, the buyer reorders something without any modifications. It is usually handled on a routine basis by the purchasing department. To keep the business, “in” suppliers try to maintain customer engagement and product and service quality. “Out” suppliers try to find new ways to add value or exploit dissatisfaction so that the buyer will consider them.

In a **modified rebuy**, the buyer wants to modify product specifications, prices, terms, or suppliers. The “in” suppliers may become nervous and feel pressured to put their best foot forward to protect an account. “Out” suppliers may see the modified rebuy situation as an opportunity to make a better offer and gain new business.

A company buying a product or service for the first time faces a **new task** situation. In such cases, the greater the cost or risk, the larger the number of decision participants and the greater the company’s efforts to collect information. The new task situation is the marketer’s greatest opportunity and challenge. The marketer not only tries to reach as many key buying influences as possible but also provides help and information. The buyer makes the fewest decisions in the straight rebuy and the most in the new task decision.

Many business buyers prefer to buy a complete solution to a problem from a single seller rather than buying separate products and services from several suppliers and putting them together. The sale often goes to the firm that engages business customers deeply and provides the most complete **system** for meeting a customer’s needs and solving its problems. Such **systems selling (or solutions selling)** is often a key business marketing strategy for winning and holding accounts. Consider IBM and its customer Six Flags Entertainment Corporation:

> Six Flags operates 19 regional theme parks across North America featuring exciting rides and water attractions, world-class roller coasters, and special shows and concerts.  
> To deliver a fun and safe experience for guests, Six Flags must carefully and effectively manage thousands of park assets—from rides and equipment to buildings and other facilities. Six Flags needed a tool for managing all those assets efficiently and effectively across its far-flung collection of parks. So it turned to IBM, which has software—called Maximo Asset Management software—that handles that very problem well.

> But IBM didn’t just hand the software over to Six Flags with best wishes for happy implementation. Instead, IBM’s Maximo Professional
