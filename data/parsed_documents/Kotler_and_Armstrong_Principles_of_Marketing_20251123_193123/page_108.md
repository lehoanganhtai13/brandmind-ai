# 3.1 Unilever’s Knorr: Ways toward a Sustainable Future

Populations are growing fast, creating challenges like poverty and lack of food, basic hygiene, and sanitation. These developments and changes affect people all over the world in one way or the other and pose new challenges for enterprises too as commodity costs fluctuate, markets become unstable, and raw materials become harder to source. In order to make its business part of the solution, British–Dutch consumer goods company Unilever launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan in 2010, which is its blueprint for sustainable business. The strategic vision is to double the size of the business while reducing the environmental footprint and increasing the company’s positive social impact. The corporation’s purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace. Consequently, Unilever is developing new business practices that promote the company as well as communities, meeting people’s increasing desire for more sustainable products and creating a brighter future for everyone.

Against this background, Unilever is accelerating the integration of sustainability into more of their brands, one of which is Knorr, the largest globally within the Unilever corporation. Knorr is a German food and beverage brand owned by Unilever since 2000, when Unilever acquired Best Foods, except in Japan, where it is made under license by Ajinomoto. It produces dehydrated soup mixes and condiments, and in 2012, its global sales contributed more than 6 percent to the corporation’s total sales. In Europe alone, Unilever sells 10 million Knorr products a day, manufactured from 128,000 tonnes of fresh vegetables a year, grown on 120,000 hectares of land that are being cultivated by 5,000 farmers.

Vegetables and herbs are the main ingredients of many Knorr products. By means of sustainable cultivation, Unilever wants to reduce its ecological footprint. In order to achieve this target, the corporation created the “Knorr Partnership for Sustainability” initiative in 2010, relying on close cooperation with suppliers and farmers. By 2012, all of Knorr’s vegetable and herb suppliers had signed up to the “Knorr Partnership for Sustainability.” Having chosen sustainable sourcing as its key focus, Knorr already purchases over 90 percent of its top 13 vegetables and herbs globally from sustainable sources. By 2020, all of the further agricultural raw materials should follow. This is in line with the company’s mission, for it believes that the widespread adoption of sustainable agriculture is crucial if over 9 billion people are to be fed without further depleting the planet’s natural resources. Sustainable farming methods have the potential to increase yields considerably, mitigate the effects of climate change, and provide economic and social benefits to smallholder farmers and rural communities. In addition, sourcing sustainably helps secure Unilever’s supplies and reduces risk and volatility in their raw material supply chains.

Sourcing sustainably also opens up opportunities for innovation: by focusing on people’s sustainable living needs and consumer preference, Unilever enhances the brand equity of Knorr. In this respect, the company also helps farmers to farm sustainably via various initiatives such as the “Knorr Sustainability Partnership Fund.” The aim of the fund is to support farmers on complex sustainable agriculture projects. Knorr will invest 50 percent of any agreed project budget, matched by an equivalent investment from their partner. This allows farmers to try out new ideas and accelerate implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Within the scope of this initiative, Knorr invests $1 million every year in knowledge and equipment for their farmers to accelerate the implementation of sustainable practices.

In order to differentiate itself from the competition and at the same time meet the increasing information demands of consumers regarding the sources and manufacture of foods, Knorr began in 2010 to better communicate its commitment to sustainable agriculture. Under the motto “Good Taste Is Our Nature,” a campaign was launched with the aim of positioning Knorr as a supplier of high-quality products that taste good and are made of natural ingredients. At Knorr in Germany, over 40 chefs are responsible for optimizing the recipes of existing products and creating new products. They are convinced that flavorsome, high-quality ingredients come from responsible cultivation. Credibility for the Knorr chefs is a further target for this campaign.

The campaign aims are to be met by means of the following strategy: The Knorr Chefs as well as its farmers and suppliers give the brand a face and translate complex issues. Instruments of dialogue such as social media are used in addition to regular events to create proximity, increase transparency, enable a positive brand experience, and thus turn consumers and employees into ambassadors.

Knorr communicates its commitment to high product quality and sustainable agriculture through comprehensive above-the-line and below-the-line measures. The mix of communications includes TV commercials, print advertisements, promotions at points of sale, and extensive online activity on the brand website, in addition to setting up a separate website for specific initiatives.
