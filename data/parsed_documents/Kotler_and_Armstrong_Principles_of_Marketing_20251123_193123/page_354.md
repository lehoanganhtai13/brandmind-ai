## Video Case Hammerpress

Printing paper goods may not sound like the best business to get into these days. But Hammerpress is a company that is carving out a niche in this old industry. And Hammerpress is doing it by returning to old technology. Today’s printing firms use computer-driven graphic design techniques and printing processes. But Hammerpress creates greeting cards, calendars, and business cards that are hand-crafted by professional artists and printed using traditional letterpress technology.

When it comes to competing, this presents both opportunities and challenges. While Hammerpress’s products certainly stand out as works of art, the cost for producing such goods is considerably higher than the industry average. This video illustrates how Hammerpress employs dynamic pricing techniques in order to meet the needs of various customer segments and thrive in a competitive environment.

After viewing the video featuring Hammerpress, answer the following questions:

- **11-15** How does Hammerpress employ the concept of dynamic pricing?  
- **11-16** Discuss the three major pricing strategies in relation to Hammerpress. Which of these three do you think is the company’s core strategic strategy?  
- **11-17** Does it make sense for Hammerpress to compete in product categories where the market dictates a price that is not profitable for the company? Explain.

## Company Case Lululemon: Indulging Customers at a Premium Price

It’s a warm summer evening in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. Hundreds of yoga practitioners—commonly known as yogis—have turned out for a free class, arranged on the turf in a perfect grid, mats on the ground. Following the instructions of the class leader, it’s one long set of downward-facing dogs, half-moons, and warrior Is, IIs, and IIIs. While these New Yorkers come from various walks of life, most of them have one thing in common. They’re wearing outfits by Lululemon—the hottest yoga apparel brand this side of India. The brand’s dominance among attendees shouldn’t come as a surprise as Lululemon sponsors this free weekly event, providing yoga-appropriate music and teachers from local studios with names like Bend & Bloom, Prana Power Yoga, and Tangerine Hot Yoga. But these Lululemon loyalists have one other thing in common. They paid a premium price for their outfits—and they couldn’t be happier.

Vancouver-based Lululemon has quickly risen to the top of a bustling market that it has played a major role in defining. With approximately 400 stores around the world, Lululemon peddles its own brand of yoga-inspired apparel with its instantly recognizable logo—an iridescent lowercase a that resembles an omega. But far more than clothing, this brand perpetuates an image and a lifestyle. The company exudes the philosophy captured by its manifesto: “We are passionate about sweating every day and we want the world to know it. Breathing deeply, drinking water and getting outside also top the list of things we can’t live without.” In other words, this brand is active, healthy, and back-to-nature and isn’t shy about saying so. It’s that image complimented by a “no discounts” credo that has a fanatically loyal customer base willing to buy everything Lululemon and not even blink at paying full premium prices.

### Riding the Wave

While yoga has been practiced in the United States since the 1960s, over the past 20 years, it has emerged from a niche activity practiced by devout New Agers to become part of the cultural mainstream. Yoga is all the rage now with everyone from students to stressed-out young professionals to retirees among the devotees of this 5,000-year-old practice. Over the past four years in the United States alone, the largely female population of yogis has increased by 50 percent to more than 36 million. More than twice that many say they want to try it for the first time in the next 12 months. They won’t need to go far—there are more than a dozen different types of yoga being taught and practiced through classes in commercial studios, including hatha yoga, acro yoga, iyengar yoga, power yoga, hot yoga, prenatal yoga, and restorative yoga. Spending on classes, clothing, and equipment has also shot up in the past four years, increasing 60 percent to a whopping $16 billion.

As this fitness explosion began to take shape, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson took notice. Having developed a passion for technical athletic fabrics through 20 years in the surf, skate, and snowboarding business, Wilson was no stranger to the apparel industry. But after taking his first yoga class in the mid-1990s, he was hooked. Convinced yoga’s time had come, he put his efforts into developing alternatives to the standard cotton yoga clothing of the time—a material that to him seemed completely inappropriate for sweaty, stretchy power yoga.

After establishing the company in 1998, Wilson began selling Lululemon clothing through yoga instructors. In November 2000, the first Lululemon store opened for business in a beach town near Vancouver. The original concept was for the store to sell clothing while also serving as a community hub where the mental and spiritual aspects of living a healthy and powerful life could be taught and discussed. But the popularity of Lululemon’s clothing made it impossible for employees to focus on anything other than selling clothing. People were drawn to the fabric, a four-way stretch blend of nylon and lycra. Sub-branded “Luon,” the “sweat-wicking and cottony-soft” material is the company’s signature fabric.

Since its first products, Lululemon has focused on innovative fabrics for every application, including Luxtreme, a version of Luon designed for the most hardcore workouts; Swift, a strong and lightweight fabric designed for freedom of movement; Boolux, a blend of natural fibers designed for warmth and breathability; Nulu, a buttery-soft and superlight version of Luon designed for a “naked” feel; and Vitasea, an ultrasoft blend of cotton, spandex, and seaweed—yes, seaweed.
