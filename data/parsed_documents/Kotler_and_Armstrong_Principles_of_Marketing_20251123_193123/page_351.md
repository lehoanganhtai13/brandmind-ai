_Deceptive pricing_ occurs when a seller states prices or price savings that mislead consumers or are not actually available to consumers. This might involve bogus reference or comparison prices, as when a retailer sets artificially high “regular” prices and then announces “sale” prices close to its previous everyday prices. For example, luxury apparel and accessories retailer Michael Kors recently settled a class action lawsuit alleging that it used deceptive pricing at its outlet stores. The retailer was charged with tagging products with false “manufacturer’s suggested retail prices” to make its supposed discounted prices more appealing when, in fact, the products were sold only in the outlet stores. Such artificial comparison pricing is widespread in retailing.²²

Although comparison pricing claims are legal if they are truthful, the Federal Trade Commission’s “Guides against Deceptive Pricing” warn sellers not to advertise (1) a price reduction unless it is a savings from the usual retail price, (2) “factory” or “wholesale” prices unless such prices are what they are claimed to be, and (3) comparable value prices on imperfect goods.²³

Other deceptive pricing issues include _scanner fraud_ and price confusion. The widespread use of scanner-based computer checkouts has led to increasing complaints of retailers overcharging their customers. Most of these overcharges result from poor management, such as a failure to enter current or sale prices into the system. Other cases, however, involve intentional overcharges.

Many federal and state statutes regulate against deceptive pricing practices. For example, the Automobile Information Disclosure Act requires automakers to attach a statement on new vehicle windows stating the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the prices of optional equipment, and the dealer’s transportation charges. However, reputable sellers go beyond what is required by law. Treating customers fairly and making certain that they fully understand prices and pricing terms are an important part of building strong and lasting customer relationships.

# 11 Reviewing and Extending the Concepts

## OBJECTIVES REVIEW AND KEY TERMS

### Objectives Review

In this chapter, we examined some additional pricing considerations—new product pricing, product mix pricing, price adjustments, initiating and reacting to price changes, and pricing and public policy. A company sets not a single price but rather a _pricing structure_ that covers its entire mix of products. This pricing structure changes over time as products move through their life cycles. The company adjusts product prices to reflect changes in costs and demand and account for variations in buyers and situations. As the competitive environment changes, the company considers when to initiate price changes and when to respond to them.

**OBJECTIVE 11-1**  
_Describe the major strategies for pricing new products._ (pp 332–333)  
Pricing is a dynamic process, and pricing strategies usually change as the product passes through its life cycle. The introductory stage—setting prices for the first time—is especially challenging. The company can decide on one of several strategies for pricing innovative new products: It can use _market-skimming pricing_ by initially setting high prices to “skim” the maximum amount of revenue from various segments of the market. Or it can use _market-penetrating pricing_ by setting a low initial price to penetrate the market deeply and win a large market share. Several conditions must be set for either new product pricing strategy to work.

**OBJECTIVE 11-2**  
_Explain how companies find a set of prices that maximizes the profits from the total product mix._ (pp 333–335)  
When the product is part of a product mix, the firm searches for a set of prices that will maximize the profits from the total mix. In _product line pricing_, the company determines the price steps for the entire product line it offers. In addition, the company must set prices for _optional products_ (optional or accessory products included with the main product), _captive products_ (products that are required for using the main product), _by-products_ (waste or residual products produced when making the main product), and _product bundles_ (combinations of products at a reduced price).

**OBJECTIVE 11-3**  
_Discuss how companies adjust their prices to take into account different types of customers and situations._ (pp 335–343)  
Companies apply a variety of _price adjustment strategies_ to account for differences in consumer segments and situations. One is _discount and allowance pricing_, whereby the company establishes cash, quantity, functional, or seasonal discounts, or varying types of allowances.
