Oreos reacted in a timely way to a power outage during Super Bowl XLVII with an outage-related “You can still dunk in the dark” tweet ad. The fast-reaction ad was re-tweeted and Favorited thousands of times in only 15 minutes. Similarly, Arby’s created big buzz during a recent Grammy Awards show with a real-time tweet responding to Pharrell Williams’s infamous Vivienne Westwood hat, which looks a bit like the hat in the familiar Arby’s logo. The tweet “Hey @Pharrell, can we have our hat back?” earned more than 80,000 re-tweets and 45,000 Favorites.24

## Evaluating Advertising Effectiveness and the Return on Advertising Investment

Measuring advertising effectiveness and the **return on advertising investment** has become a hot issue for most companies. Top management at many companies is asking marketing managers, “How do we know that we’re spending the right amount on advertising?” and “What return are we getting on our advertising investment?”

Advertisers should regularly evaluate two types of advertising results: the communication effects and the sales and profit effects. Measuring the *communication effects* of an ad or ad campaign tells whether the ads and media are communicating the ad message well. Individual ads can be tested before or after they are run. Before an ad is placed, the advertiser can show it to consumers, ask how they like it, and measure message recall or attitude changes resulting from it. After an ad is run, the advertiser can measure how the ad affected consumer recall or product awareness, engagement, knowledge, and preference. Pre- and post-evaluations of communication effects can be made for entire advertising campaigns as well.

Advertisers have gotten pretty good at measuring the communication effects of their ads and ad campaigns. However, *sales and profit* effects of advertising and other content are often much harder to measure. For example, what sales and profits are produced by an ad campaign that increases brand awareness by 20 percent and brand preference by 10 percent? Sales and profits are affected by many factors other than advertising—such as product features, price, and availability.

One way to measure the sales and profit effects of advertising is to compare past sales and profits with past advertising expenditures. Another way is through experiments. For example, to test the effects of different advertising spending levels, Coca-Cola could vary the amount it spends on advertising in different market areas and measure the differences in the resulting sales and profit levels. More complex experiments could be designed to include other variables, such as differences in the ads or media used.

However, because so many factors affect advertising effectiveness, some controllable and others not, pretesting ads and measuring the results of advertising spending remains an inexact science. Managers often must rely on large doses of judgment along with quantitative analysis when assessing content and advertising performance. That’s especially true in this content-hungry digital age, where large quantities of ads and other content are produced and run on a virtual real-time basis. Thus, whereas companies tend to carefully pretest traditional big-budget media ads before running them, digital marketing content usually goes untested. For digital and social media campaigns, says one chief marketing officer, “it’s very tough to test [and measure] just because of the volume [and timing] of the content we are putting out.”25

## Other Advertising Considerations

In developing advertising strategies and programs, the company must address two additional questions. First, how will the company organize its advertising and content function—who will perform which advertising tasks? Second, how will the company adapt its advertising strategies and programs to the complexities of international markets?
