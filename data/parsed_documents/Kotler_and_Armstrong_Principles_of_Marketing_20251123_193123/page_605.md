## Extending Marketing

So Brown takes cues from high-end grocers by doing things like hand-stacking fresh fruits and produce to avoid bruising and make it more eye-catching. His ShopRite stores also hire skilled butchers, fishmongers, and in-store chefs to entice shoppers to choose healthier options, such as “fire-grilled chicken,” cooked right in the store.

Perhaps most important, Brown’s ShopRite stores have become parts of the communities in which they operate. Brown and his associates work with local leaders even before a store opens to learn exactly what they seek in a neighborhood grocery store. They research neighborhood demographics and tailor offerings to community preferences. Brown’s ShopRite stores are also community gathering places, providing community center space in stores for local meetings and events. The company even works with local nonprofits to provide free services such as credit unions, social workers, and health clinics. Such services help the community but also help Brown’s ShopRites by building a more frequent and loyal customer base. “In the end, it’s really about putting the supermarket at the center of the community,” concludes one food retailing expert.

Clearly, better marketing systems must be built to service disadvantaged consumers. In fact, like Brown’s, marketers in many industries profitably target such consumers with legitimate goods and services that create real value. In cases where marketers do not step in to fill the void, the government likely will. For example, the FTC has taken action against sellers that advertise false values, wrongfully deny services, or charge disadvantaged customers too much.

### Marketing’s Impact on Society as a Whole

The American marketing system has been accused of adding to several “evils” in American society at large, such as creating too much materialism, too few social goods, and a glut of cultural pollution.

#### False Wants and Too Much Materialism

Critics have charged that the marketing system urges too much interest in material possessions, and that America’s love affair with worldly possessions is not sustainable. Too often, people are judged by what they *own* rather than by who they *are*. The critics do not view this interest in material things as a natural state of mind but rather as a matter of false wants created by marketing. Marketers, they claim, stimulate people’s desires for goods and create materialistic models of the good life. Thus, marketers have created an endless cycle of mass consumption based on a distorted interpretation of the “American Dream.”

> In this view, marketing’s purpose is to promote consumption, and the inevitable outcome of successful marketing is unsustainable *over*consumption. According to the critics, more is not always better. Some groups have taken their concerns straight to the public. For example, the Center for a New American Dream is a nonprofit organization founded on a mission to “help Americans to reduce and shift their consumption to improve quality of life, protect the environment, and promote social justice.”

> Through educational videos and marketing campaigns such as “More fun! Less stuff!” the organization works with individuals, institutions, communities, and businesses to help conserve natural resources, counter the commercialization of culture, and promote positive changes in the way goods are produced and consumed.¹¹

Marketers respond that such criticisms overstate the power of business to create needs. They claim people have strong defenses against advertising and other marketing tools. Marketers are most effective when

they appeal to existing wants rather than when they attempt to create new ones. Furthermore, people seek information when making important purchases and often do not rely on single sources. Even minor purchases that may be affected by advertising messages lead to repeat purchases only if the product delivers the promised customer value.
