In exchange for the bare-bones environment, they offer ultralow prices and surprise deals on selected branded merchandise. Warehouse clubs have grown rapidly in recent years. These retailers appeal not only to low-income consumers seeking bargains on bare-bones products but also to all kinds of customers shopping for a wide range of goods, from necessities to extravagances.

Consider Costco, now the world’s second-largest retailer behind only Walmart. Low price is an important part of Costco’s equation, but what really sets Costco apart is the products it carries and the sense of urgency that it builds into the Costco shopper’s store experience (see Real Marketing 13.1).

## Organizational Approach

Although many retail stores are independently owned, others band together under some form of corporate or contractual organization. ● **Table 13.2** describes four major types of retail organizations—*corporate chains*, *voluntary chains*, *retailer cooperatives*, and *franchise organizations*.

**Corporate chains** are two or more outlets that are commonly owned and controlled. They have many advantages over independents. Their size allows them to buy in large quantities at lower prices and gain promotional economies. They can hire specialists to deal with areas such as pricing, promotion, merchandising, inventory control, and sales forecasting.

The great success of corporate chains caused many independents to band together in one of two forms of contractual associations. One is the *voluntary chain*—a wholesaler-sponsored group of independent retailers that engages in group buying and common merchandising. Examples include the Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA), Western Auto, and True Value hardware stores. The other type of contractual association is the *retailer cooperative*—a group of independent retailers that bands together to set up a jointly owned, central wholesale operation and conduct joint merchandising and promotion efforts. Examples are Associated Grocers and Ace Hardware. These organizations give independents the buying and promotion economies they need to meet the prices of corporate chains.

Another form of contractual retail organization is a **franchise**. The main difference between franchise organizations and other contractual systems (voluntary chains and retail cooperatives) is that franchise systems are normally based on some unique product or service; a method of doing business; or the trade name, goodwill, or patent that the franchisor has developed. Franchising has been prominent in fast-food restaurants, motels, health and fitness centers, auto sales and service dealerships, and real estate agencies.

### ● Table 13.2 | Major Types of Retail Organizations

This table outlines different types of retail organizations, categorized by their ownership and control structures. Corporate chains represent multiple outlets under common ownership, prevalent in sectors like department stores, discount stores, and grocery stores, with examples including Macy's and Target. Voluntary chains are wholesaler-sponsored alliances of independent retailers focused on collective purchasing and merchandising, such as Independent Grocers Alliance (IGA). Retailer cooperatives are similar, comprising independent retailers who jointly manage a central buying organization and promotional activities, exemplified by Associated Grocers and Ace Hardware. Finally, franchise organizations are contractual agreements where independent franchisees acquire the rights to operate units within a larger system, as seen with McDonald's and 7-Eleven. The overarching structure is comparative, differentiating these retail models based on their degree of centralization and independence. Giant Walmart is used to beating up on competitors.
