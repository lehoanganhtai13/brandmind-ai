## AS THE FERRERO STORY

highlights, good products and marketing programs begin with good customer information. Companies also need an abundance of information on competitors, resellers, and other actors and marketplace forces. But more than just gathering information, marketers must *use* the information to gain powerful *customer and market insights*.

> Marketing information by itself has little value. The value is in the *customer insights* gained from the information and how marketers use these insights to make better decisions.

## Marketing Information and Customer Insights

To create value for customers and build meaningful relationships with them, marketers must first gain fresh, deep insights into what customers need and want. Such customer insights come from good marketing information. Companies use these customer insights to develop a competitive advantage.

For example, when it began six years ago, social media site Pinterest needed to differentiate itself from the dozens, even hundreds, of existing social networking options.

Pinterest’s research uncovered a key customer insight: Many people want more than just Twitter- or Facebook-like places to swap messages and pictures. They want a way to collect, organize, and share things on the internet related to their interests and passions. So Pinterest created a social scrapbooking site where people can create and share digital pinboards—theme-based image collections of things that inspire them. “Pinterest is your own little internet of only the things you love,” says the company.

Thanks to this unique customer insight, Pinterest has been wildly popular. Today, more than 100 million active monthly Pinterest users collectively pin more than 5 million articles a day and view more than 2.5 billion Pinterest pages a month. In turn, more than a half-million businesses use Pinterest to engage and inspire their customer communities. For example, L.L.Bean has 5.1 million Pinterest followers, Nordstrom has 4.3 million followers, and Lowe’s has 3.4 million followers. Some 47 percent of U.S. online shoppers have purchased something as a result of a Pinterest recommendation.

Although customer and market insights are important for building customer value and engagement, these insights can be very difficult to obtain. Customer needs and buying motives are often anything but obvious—consumers themselves usually can’t tell you exactly what they need and why they buy. To gain good customer insights, marketers must effectively manage marketing information from a wide range of sources.
