Finally, *format* elements make a difference in an ad’s impact as well as in its cost. A small change in an ad’s design can make a big difference in its effect. In a print or display ad, the *illustration* is the first thing the reader notices—it must be strong enough to draw attention. Next, the *headline* must effectively entice the right people to read the copy. Finally, the *copy*—the main block of text in the ad—must be simple but strong and convincing. Moreover, these three elements must effectively work *together* to engage customers and persuasively present customer value. However, novel formats can help an ad stand out from the clutter. 

For example, in recent ads for Sherwin-Williams paint, eye-catching illustrations—featuring dazzling colors and unique designs—capture attention and deliver the bulk of the message. Once the illustrations engage the reader, small-print headlines ask, “Where will color take you?” while a familiar Sherwin-Williams “Cover the Earth” logo identifies the brand.

### Consumer-Generated Content

Taking advantage of today’s digital and social media technologies, many companies are now tapping consumers for marketing content, message ideas, or even actual ads and videos. Sometimes the results are outstanding; sometimes they are forgettable. If done well, however, user-generated content can incorporate the voice of the customer into brand messages and generate greater customer engagement.

Perhaps the best-known consumer-generated content effort is the former “Crash the Super Bowl Challenge” held annually by PepsiCo’s Doritos brand. For more than a decade, Doritos invited consumers to create their own 30-second video ads, with winners receiving cash awards and having their ads run during the Super Bowl. Based on the success of the “Crash the Super Bowl” contest, Doritos now runs new campaigns that create fun fan-made ads and other content throughout the year. [16]

Brands across a wide range of industries—from automakers and fast-food chains to home furnishings brands and pet food marketers—now routinely incorporate user-generated social media content into their own traditional and social media marketing campaigns. For example, trendy home furnishings maker West Elm runs a campaign called #MyWestElm. The campaign collects user-generated photos of West Elm products shared online and uses them in promotional posts on its web, Facebook, and Pinterest sites along with links to similar products on the company’s online store. So far, some 18,000 photos have been uploaded, and the MyWestElm website attracts 2 million monthly users. Moreover, 40 percent of West Elm’s product webpages now also contain user-generated photos showing buyers how fellow customers use the products in the real world. [17]

Consumer-generated content can make customers an everyday part of the brand. For example, rather than relying on high-powered advertising, shoe brand Converse steps aside and lets customers themselves co-create the brand and co-author the brand story (see Real Marketing 15.2). And action-camera maker GoPro has long featured consumer-made videos on its web and social media sites as a means of letting customers share their high-octane experiences with others. Such videos have attracted a huge following, creating an engaged GoPro customer community that helps shape and share GoPro usage and lore. The collection of high-quality user-made GoPro content contains truly spellbinding scenes captured by adventure-seeking amateurs and professionals. 

Some of the content is so good that the company has set up a GoPro Licensing division that licenses the best user-generated GoPro content to other brands for use in their own promotional campaigns, inviting them to “use the best of GoPro to tell your story.” [18]

Not all consumer-generated content efforts, however, are so successful. As many The iconic Converse brand has a long, storied history.
