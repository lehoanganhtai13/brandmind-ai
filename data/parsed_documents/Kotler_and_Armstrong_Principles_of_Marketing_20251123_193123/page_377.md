Exclusive dealing often includes *exclusive territorial agreements*. The producer may agree not to sell to other dealers in a given area, or the buyer may agree to sell only in its own territory. The first practice is normal under franchise systems as a way to increase dealer enthusiasm and commitment. It is also perfectly legal—a seller has no legal obligation to sell through more outlets than it wishes. The second practice, whereby the producer tries to keep a dealer from selling outside its territory, has become a major legal issue.

Producers of a strong brand sometimes sell it to dealers only if the dealers will take some or all of the rest of its line. This is called *full-line forcing*. Such *tying agreements* are not necessarily illegal, but they violate the Clayton Act if they tend to lessen competition substantially. The practice may prevent consumers from freely choosing among competing suppliers of these other brands.

Finally, producers are free to select their dealers, but their right to terminate dealers is somewhat restricted. In general, sellers can drop dealers “for cause.” However, they cannot drop dealers if, for example, the dealers refuse to cooperate in a doubtful legal arrangement, such as exclusive dealing or tying agreements.

# Marketing Logistics and Supply Chain Management

In today’s global marketplace, selling a product is sometimes easier than getting it to customers. Companies must decide on the best way to store, handle, and move their products and services so that they are available to customers in the right assortments, at the right time, and in the right place. Logistics effectiveness has a major impact on both customer satisfaction and company costs. Here we consider the nature and importance of logistics management in the supply chain, the goals of the logistics system, major logistics functions, and the need for integrated supply chain management.

## Nature and Importance of Marketing Logistics

To some managers, marketing logistics means only trucks and warehouses. But modern logistics is much more than this. **Marketing logistics**—also called **physical distribution**—involves planning, implementing, and controlling the physical flow of goods, services, and related information from points of origin to points of consumption to meet customer requirements at a profit. In short, it involves getting the right product to the right customer in the right place at the right time profitably.

In the past, physical distribution planners typically started with products at the plant and then tried to find low-cost solutions to get them to customers. However, today’s *customer-centered* logistics starts with the marketplace and works backward to the factory or even to sources of supply. Marketing logistics involves not only **outbound logistics** (moving products from the factory to resellers and ultimately to customers) but also **inbound logistics** (moving products and materials from suppliers to the factory) and **reverse logistics** (reusing, recycling, refurbishing, or disposing of broken, unwanted, or excess products returned by consumers or resellers). That is, it involves the entirety of **supply chain management**—managing upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among suppliers, the company, resellers, and final consumers, as shown in Figure 12.5.

The logistics manager’s task is to coordinate the activities of suppliers, purchasing agents, marketers,

This diagram illustrates a value chain model, depicting the flow of goods and services from origin to consumption, and importantly, the return flow. The primary flow begins with **Suppliers** providing inputs to the **Company**. The Company then processes these inputs and distributes finished products to **Resellers**. Finally, **Resellers** deliver these products to the end **Customers**. Complementing this forward flow is the concept of **Reverse logistics**, which represents the movement of goods from **Customers** back through **Resellers** and potentially to the **Company** or even back to **Suppliers**, encompassing returns, repairs, or recycling. This structure highlights both the primary operational flow and the critical feedback loop for product lifecycle management.

> Managing the supply chain calls for customer-centered thinking. Remember, it’s also called the customer value delivery network.
