        Analyze the document structure in this folder and create a global_map.json file.

        Follow your cognitive workflow:
        1. RECONNAISSANCE: Find the Table of Contents
        2. TARGET ACQUISITION: For each section, verify location and pinpoint exact line numbers
        3. CONTEXTUALIZATION: Create rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities
        4. ARTIFACT GENERATION: Write the complete JSON to /global_map.json

        Remember: Use write_file tool to save the final JSON. Do not output JSON in chat.

💭 Thinking:
  **Initiating Global Map Creation**

Alright, let's get down to business. Time to generate that `global_map.json` file. First things first, it's reconnaissance time. Gotta get a feel for the lay of the land, understand the document's structure, and locate the Table of Contents.  I'll kick things off by listing the files in this directory. That should give me a good initial overview.

  **Mapping the Document's Structure**

Alright, I'm looking at a whole bunch of markdown files – looks like a complete document.  First things first, I need to understand its layout. To do that, I've got to find the Table of Contents.  I'll start with the obvious approach. Often, the ToC is at the beginning, so I'll check `page_1.md` first.  If that doesn't hold the structure, I'll move on to `page_2.md`, and so on. Let's see what we've got.

💭 Thinking:
  **Mapping the Terrain: Initial Reconnaissance**

Okay, so I need to construct this `global_map.json` file. The aim is to capture the overall structure of this document, essentially building a digital Table of Contents. First things first, I need to get a lay of the land. That means I need to locate the existing Table of Contents.  I'm going to start by looking for a dedicated ToC file, that's the obvious first move. If that's not immediately apparent, then I'll delve into the files themselves, starting with the front end – reading the first few pages, maybe the first 10, to see if the ToC is embedded there. That'll be my starting point. From there, I can begin to identify the logical components and their relationships.

  Okay, I need to generate a `global_map.json` file. First, I'll locate the Table of Contents by examining the initial pages of the document to understand its structure.

  **Getting Oriented: Textbook Detective Work**

Okay, so I've got this directory, and I've listed the files and skimmed the first few pages. Textbook vibes, definitely. Now, the crucial first step for *any* textbook is understanding its structure. I need to get my hands on that Table of Contents. It's the map to the whole operation.

I'm thinking, "Where would the ToC be?" Let's start the hunt! I'll page through sequentially, but I know the typical layout, so I won't dawdle too long. It's usually tucked away in the first few chapters, right? Pages 5 to 15 seem like a good place to concentrate my efforts. Let's see if I can find that navigational gold!

  **Finding the Roadmap**

Okay, so I've finally gotten my hands on this document and I'm eager to dive in. Right now, I'm focusing on getting a sense of the layout, and page 15 seems to have the Table of Contents, but it's clearly not complete. Seems like a common issue with larger documents. I'll need to get the full picture, so I'm going to carefully review page 14 to see if it starts there and then skim page 16 to see if it continues on. It's the most efficient way to get a solid overview of the structure. Knowing the TOC is important before I dive in too deep.

💭 Thinking:
  **Building the `global_map.json` File**

Alright, having reviewed pages 14 through 17 – which I believe comprise the complete Table of Contents – I'm ready to tackle constructing the `global_map.json` file. My plan is straightforward, leveraging the ToC's structure to guide me.

Essentially, for each entry in the ToC, I'll follow this process:

1.  **Initial Guess:** I'll use the page number listed in the ToC as my starting point, my initial hypothesis for the section's location.
2.  **Validation:** I'll actually read the content of that page to verify that the expected section header is present. This is crucial for avoiding any indexing discrepancies.
3.  **Precise Pinpointing:** Once I've confirmed the header's existence, I need to pinpoint its exact starting line. This level of detail will be important for later processing.
4.  **Contextualization:** Finally, I'll compose a succinct summary of the section. This will provide valuable context within the `global_map.json` file.

To keep everything organized and track my progress, I'll leverage the `write_todos` tool. It's the most efficient way to manage this iterative process.

  **My Current Strategy: Mapping the Marketing Landscape**

Okay, so I've just reviewed the table of contents (pages 14-17, for reference), and I'm ready to build a comprehensive framework in my mind. Think of it as my "Hypothesis List," a detailed map of the entire marketing subject matter covered in this document. My next step will be to verify each element on that list against the actual content.

This framework is organized into four main parts:

*   **Part 1: Foundational Concepts:** Defining the core principles of marketing and the strategic marketing process (Chapters 1 & 2).
*   **Part 2: Market Understanding:** Analyzing the environment, gaining insights, and understanding consumer and business buyer behavior (Chapters 3-6).
*   **Part 3: Value-Driven Strategies & Mix:** Designing strategies around customer value, encompassing product development, pricing, distribution, and integrated communication (Chapters 7-17).
*   **Part 4: Expanding the Scope:** Exploring competitive advantage, global markets, and sustainable marketing practices (Chapters 18-20).

Beyond the main content, I've noted the appendices, which include the marketing plan, "marketing by the numbers", and careers in marketing, as well as the glossary, references, and the index. 

This gives me a very clear, working structure.

  **Locating the Beginning of "Part 1"**

Okay, I'm diving into "Part 1: Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process."  Knowing the organization of this material is key.  The Table of Contents, in its usual frustrating way, doesn't specify a page number for the "Part" introductions.  So, I need to pinpoint where "Part 1" actually begins. The text *should* start with Chapter 1 on page 32. I'll need to double check that page, and possibly even the preceding one, to find the actual "Part 1" header.  Once I locate that, I can properly situate myself in the framework the author is using.  It's just a quick step, but necessary to properly navigate the argument.

  **Chapter Title Hunt**

Okay, so I'm digging into this document and I'm a bit perplexed. I flipped over to pages 31 and 32 to get a feel for the start of Chapter 1, but I can't seem to locate a clear "Part 1" title. It could be that those "Part" designations are just logical groupings within the table of contents and aren't actually flagged in the text itself. No matter. I'll proceed as if I'm looking for the start of the chapter itself.

The ToC said Chapter 1 begins on page 32, so I went to that page. My initial glance confirms that the content aligns with the core subject of Chapter 1 - "Market Offerings—Products, Services, and Experiences." The crux of the chapter, no doubt. Still, I'm not seeing the actual title, "# Chapter 1", as I'd expect. Hmm... I'm going to run a `line_search` function and zero in on the exact spot where the chapter title is. I'll start the search on page 32 itself.

Given that page 31 seems to be a continuation of the introduction, I'm going to jump back and check page 30. It's a hunch, but a solid one based on the structure of the text and my experience. Let's see if that's where the title is hiding.

  **Navigating the Murky Waters of Chapter Titles**

Okay, I'm hitting a snag here. Finding the precise title for Chapter 1 is proving trickier than anticipated. It seems the document isn't following the standard "# Chapter 1" convention, which is, frankly, a bit annoying. The Table of Contents points to page 32, but when I get there, I'm already knee-deep in the subject matter. So, I need a broader approach. Let's try a wider search using `grep`. I'll scan the first 40 pages, looking for the phrase "Chapter 1" – that should zero in on the relevant starting point and allow me to determine the true heading. This should, hopefully, clear up this little organizational hiccup.

Okay, so the initial `grep` run gave me a deluge of files, which isn't exactly what I was after. I need to refine this.  I'm going to revisit `grep`, but this time I'll make a few strategic adjustments.  First, the `output_mode` needs to be set to `content`. I want to *see* the matching lines, not just a list of files. That's the real information I need.  And secondly, I'll limit the search to the first 40 pages. That should help me focus on the most relevant area, hopefully reducing the noise and making it easier to pinpoint what I'm looking for. Let's see if this more focused approach yields better results.

  **Making Progress with Precision**

Okay, so the `grep` search with the content filter was a lifesaver! Finally, I found exactly what I needed.  `page_28.md` is the key – it has the line I was looking for: `# Chapter 1 | Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement`.  Perfect! Now, I can move forward with defining Part 1.

I'm structuring Part 1 like this:

*   **Title:** "Part 1: Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process"
*   **Level:** 1
*   **start\_page\_id:** Since the "Part 1" title isn't explicitly in the text, I'm setting this to `page_28.md`, which contains the first chapter.
*   **start\_line\_index:**  I'll set the start line to the chapter title's line.
*   **end\_page\_id:**  The next part starts with Chapter 3, which the table of contents tells me is on page 94, so the last page of Part 1 will be page 93.

Now, I'll define Chapter 1:

*   **Title:** "Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement"
*   **Level:** 2
*   **start\_page\_id:** This is, again, `page_28.md`.
*   **start\_line\_index:** Let's see... looking at the file... line 11.
*   **end\_page\_id:** According to the table of contents, Chapter 2 starts on page 66, so Chapter 1 ends on page 65.

I'm double-checking the ToC - yes, it confirms Chapter 2 begins on page 66.  I'm ready to move on.

  **Chapter Title Hunt**

Okay, so I've just scanned page 66, and the Chapter 2 title isn't jumping out at me. A bit odd, but no worries. This happens sometimes when formatting is a bit off or the title's cleverly disguised. Let me fire up `line_search`. It's the logical next step. That utility is a workhorse for these situations; it's practically tailor-made for pinpointing exactly where the title is hiding, even if it's embedded within some pre-formatted text or a weirdly placed figure caption. This should be quick work.

Okay, so the `line_search` function on page 65 didn't give me what I needed.  Frustrating, but no big deal.  My next move is clear:  I'll just leverage the power of `grep`.  I'm betting the presence of "Chapter 2" in the text will be a strong indicator of the section I'm looking for.  `Grep` should quickly pinpoint the correct page for me, given how structured the document usually is.  This is a classic example of using the right tool for the job – `line_search` was a good attempt, but `grep` is going to be far more efficient for this particular task.  Onward!

  **Chapter Mapping Update: Ready to Finalize and Summarize**

Okay, so `grep` confirmed it – `page_70.md` has the official title for Chapter 2.  It's a slight variation on the ToC entry, but that's fine. It's time to nail down these chapter details.

Chapter 1 is locked in:

*   **Title:** Marketing: Creating Customer Value and Engagement
*   **Level:** 2
*   **start_page_id:** `page_28.md`
*   **start_line_index:** 11
*   **end_page_id:** `page_69.md`

And now, Chapter 2:

*   **Title:** Company and Marketing Strategy
*   **Level:** 2
*   **start_page_id:** `page_70.md`
*   **start_line_index:** 11
*   **end_page_id:** `page_93.md` - that's based on Chapter 3 starting on page 94. Makes sense.

With the chapter mapping done, it's time to move on to the next phase: Summarization! I'll hand that off to a subagent – keeps the main agent clean and focused on this mapping process. Let's get these summaries rolling!

Okay, so `grep` confirmed it: `page_92.md` is where Chapter 3 begins, with that line `# Chapter 3 | Analyzing the Marketing Environment`. That means my ToC was off by two pages. No big deal, easily corrected. Now I can finally define the structure for Part 2, and then drill down into the chapters.

Part 2, which I'll title "Understanding the Marketplace and Consumer Value," will start on `page_92.md`. Since the "Part" title itself isn't present in the text, the `start_line_index` for the part will simply be the index of that Chapter 3 title. And based on the ToC, it looks like Part 2 wraps up at the end of page 209, before Chapter 7.

Now, for Chapter 3. I already know the title, "Analyzing the Marketing Environment," and it starts on `page_92.md`. The starting line index will be 11, the line of the chapter title. Chapter 4 begins on page 128, according to the ToC, so Chapter 3 ends on page 127.

Now, I'll quickly double-check that Chapter 4 actually *does* start on page 128. Gotta keep that ToC honest!

*   **End Page:** Chapter 5 kicks off on page 160, so the end of Chapter 4 has to be page 159.

Next, I need to make sure I get the start of Chapter 5 correct, since that's what defines the end of this one. The ToC says page 160. I'll need to double-check that by actually looking at the file and confirm.

  **Getting Started with Customer Value-Driven Strategy**

Okay, I'm diving into "Part 3: Designing a Customer Value-Driven Strategy and Mix". I know this section covers Chapters 7 through 17.  My immediate task is to locate the start of Part 3 in the document. I figure it'll be close to the beginning of Chapter 7, and according to the Table of Contents, Chapter 7 kicks off on page 210. So, I'll turn to page 210 and confirm the section heading. That should be a quick way to orient myself.

  **Mapping Out the Structure: A Deep Dive into Strategy**

Okay, I've got it. Chapter 7 is right here on page 211, the table of contents was just a hair off. Excellent. Now I can really start fleshing out this section. I'm focusing on Part 3, and here's the structure I'm envisioning:

**Part 3: Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix** - That's our overarching theme.  It's at level 1, and this whole part kicks off on page 211.  Since the next part begins with Chapter 18 on page 540, this segment will conclude on page 539.

Now, let's drill down into Chapter 7: "Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy: Creating Value for Target Customers." It's level 2. We're still at `page_211.md`, and it also begins at line 11. Since Chapter 8 starts on page 242, Chapter 7 will wrap up at the end of page 241.

Alright, time to make sure that's correct, I'll double-check that Chapter 8 begins on page 242.

I'm looking at "Developing New Products and Managing the Product Life Cycle" - the title's spot on. Now, I need to confirm the end of Chapter 9. Chapter 10, according to the ToC, should start on page 306, so I figure that means Chapter 9 wraps up on page 305. Now I'm going to double-check that by turning to the beginning of Chapter 10 to make sure the transition is clean. Always good to be thorough with this kind of stuff.

  **Chapter Navigation Check-In**

Okay, so I've landed on Chapter 10, "Pricing: Understanding and Capturing Customer Value," finally. The Table of Contents was a smidge off, putting it on page 307 instead of the expected spot. It's a Level 2 chapter, which makes sense given its importance. Let's see, it starts on `page_307.md` at line index 11. I should probably note that Chapter 11 starts on page 330, meaning this chapter concludes on page 329. That checks out with my general understanding of the book's structure.

Now, I'll quickly verify the beginning of Chapter 11. The ToC indicates page 330, so I'll double-check that. Always good to be precise, especially with a topic as crucial as pricing.

That's a minor detail, easily corrected.  Now, the real task is to confirm the scope.  The title, "Marketing Channels: Delivering Customer Value," is right there, level 2 heading as expected.  I need to determine the precise boundaries of this chapter.  Given that Chapter 13 begins on page 390 according to the ToC, I'm going to assume that the end of Chapter 12 is therefore page 389.  My next step is to quickly verify that Chapter 13 actually *does* commence on page 390. This is just a sanity check to confirm the overall structure.

Specifically, this chapter, "Retailing and Wholesaling," is a Level 2 heading.  My internal indexing puts the beginning of this chapter on `page_391.md` at line 11.  I need to determine the chapter's boundaries, so I'll check where the next chapter begins.  Since Chapter 14 starts on page 422, this chapter must end on page 421.

Now, to maintain accuracy, I'll quickly verify the starting page of Chapter 14 as per the ToC. I will confirm that it's on page 422, as indicated.

💭 Thinking:
  **Tracking Down the Right Chapter**

Okay, so I've finally located Chapter 14.  The Table of Contents was a bit misleading, it looks like it was off by one page, but no big deal.  Here's what I've got:

*   **Chapter Title:** Engaging Consumers and Communicating Customer Value: Integrated Marketing Communication Strategy. Seems like a pretty standard title.
*   **Level:** It's labeled as a Level 2 chapter, which makes sense within the overall structure of the book.
*   **Starting Point:** Page 423.  I've got the markdown file ready to go, `page_423.md`, and I can see it's starting at line 11.
*   **Chapter End:**  I've also calculated that Chapter 14 ends on page 449 because Chapter 15 apparently kicks off on page 450.

Now, just to be thorough and to double-check my work, I'm going to quickly verify the start of Chapter 15. The ToC indicates page 450, so that should be straightforward.

Okay, I've just double-checked page 450, and it's definitely the tail end of Chapter 14's material. No surprises there.  I need to get to the beginning of Chapter 15, so I'll flip over to page 451. That should be where the new chapter kicks off, and I can dive into the fresh content. Hopefully, it's properly labeled, and I can avoid any further page-turning gymnastics.

  **Locating and Verifying Chapter Boundaries**

Okay, so I've navigated to page 451. The Table of Contents was *slightly* off - a one-page discrepancy, which isn't unusual with these large documents. This marks the beginning of Chapter 15, "Advertising and Public Relations." I can confirm the chapter's metadata: it's a level 2 section, which fits with the overall structure. It *starts* on `page_451.md` at line 11.

Now, to determine the *end* of this chapter. The file structure indicates Chapter 16 commences on page 478. Thus, Chapter 15 concludes on page 477. Next, I should cross-check this against the Table of Contents, to ensure complete consistency, and make any necessary adjustments to the page ranges. This is crucial for accurate referencing and indexing.

Let's see... it's titled "Personal Selling and Sales Promotion", and it's a Level 2 chapter, which makes sense given the structure of this text. I can see the end page will be 509, right before Chapter 17 kicks off on 510. Good. I'll take a quick peek to confirm that Chapter 17 actually does start where it's supposed to.

Now, let's nail down the section's boundaries. Part 4 starts on page 541 (where Chapter 18 begins) and concludes on page 626, as the Appendices begin on the following page.  Chapter 18 itself, being a discrete unit, extends from page 541 until page 565, since the subsequent chapter starts on page 566.

Just to be thorough, I'm now going to confirm the starting page of Chapter 19 as listed in the ToC. That page is listed as 566.

So, the metadata confirms it: Chapter 19 starts on page 567 and, based on the chapter length and where Chapter 20 begins (page 596), we can confidently say it ends on page 595. Excellent.

*   Appendix 3: Careers in Marketing - probably geared towards those entering the field or making career shifts.
*   The Glossary - Always helpful for definitions.
*   The References - A key source for further research, of course.
*   Finally, the Index - I'll make sure it is accurate and that key terms are present and easily accessible.

I'll start with Appendix 1. The ToC indicates page 627, so I'll verify the beginning of the actual section.

Okay, so I've just navigated to page 627 and confirmed that this is indeed the beginning of what the Table of Contents lists as Appendix 1, "Marketing Plan".  It's a bit odd that there's no explicit title on the page itself, but the ToC is usually pretty reliable, so I'm going to proceed with that assumption.

I've noted that this section starts at line 11 on the page and that this entire appendix extends up to and including page 636, as Appendix 2 begins on 637.  Now, I'll move on to verifying the starting point of Appendix 2, just to make sure the document flow is correct. The ToC indicates that Appendix 2 begins on page 637, so I'll check that next.

  **My Analysis of the Appendix Section**

Okay, so I've just double-checked page 637, and it looks like we're definitely kicking off Appendix 2 there, even if there isn't a *super* obvious title on the page itself. I'll pull the title from the Table of Contents – that's usually the most reliable source.  So, we're dealing with "Appendix 2: Marketing by the Numbers."  I've got the essential metadata sorted: level 1 heading, the start is page_637.md starting at line 11, and since Appendix 3 begins on page 655, we can confidently assume Appendix 2 wraps up on page 654. Now, I'll quickly verify the starting point for Appendix 3 using the ToC. That should be a straightforward check.

  **Organizing the Reference Material**

Okay, so I've just landed on page 655, and it looks like we're kicking off Appendix 3. The ToC confirms this. Even though there isn't a *bolded* title on the page itself, the ToC lists it as "Careers in Marketing," and that's the level 1 header. I'll make sure to use that.

Let's pin down the key details. We've got the `start_page_id` which is `page_655.md`, and the `start_line_index` at 11. Now, where does this thing end? Well, the Glossary starts on page 667 according to the ToC, so Appendix 3 wraps up on page 666. Perfect.

Now, I need to check and verify the starting point for the Glossary. Gotta make sure everything's in its proper place.

  **Navigating the Back Matter**

Okay, so I've just landed on page 667, and it looks like we're starting the Glossary here.  Let me confirm the details... Yup, the "Glossary" title is showing, level 1 heading, and the associated page ID is confirmed as `page_667.md`. I can see the start line index is 11, so that makes sense. Now I just need to figure out where this thing ends.  Ah, I know, the References start on page 675. That means the Glossary ends on page 674.  Got it! Now I need to quickly switch gears and verify the start of those References. According to the Table of Contents, they should begin on page 675.

  **Analyzing the Structure: References and the Index**

Okay, I've just confirmed the References section in this document. Looks like it kicks off on page 675, as indicated.  I've double-checked, and it's definitely the beginning of the references. Now I need to nail down the end of that section - since the index is up next. The ToC tells me the Index starts on page 705, so that confirms that the references end on page 704. Good. Now, I'll need to move onto the verification of the Index itself.

  **My Indexing Process Begins**

Okay, so I've just landed on page 705. It's clear this is where the index kicks off. I've confirmed that the 'Index' title is at Level 1, as expected. I'm noting the starting page, `page_705.md`, and the line index. I'll need to remember this for later. For the end, I know the last page of this document is 736, so I'll mark that as the conclusion of the index.

With all the book's sections now processed, I'm shifting focus to the appendices and other remaining content.  To keep things streamlined, I'll leverage a subagent to handle the summarization for those parts. That'll allow me to maintain a good flow and accuracy.

"Appendices and other sections" are done, marked as complete. Check. Now, the main event: time to generate the `global_map.json` file.

Okay, I've got everything I need now.  The skeleton's ready –  the structure, the page ranges, and those crucial start line indexes for each section are all present. Plus, the subagents have delivered their summaries for each part and chapter.  Excellent.

My next task is straightforward: I'm going to carefully assemble all this into the `global_map.json` object. No need to show my work in the chat; I'll handle it internally.  Once that JSON object is perfectly constructed in memory, I'll leverage the `write_file` tool to save it as `/global_map.json`.  It's time to put all this information together.

Okay, I've got it. The `global_map.json` file is generated and safely stored. It's the whole enchilada – every piece, every chapter, every appendix meticulously mapped out. For each section, I've nailed down the title, level, page numbers, line index, and – the best part – a really solid summary. Remember the strategy? Recon to find the Table of Contents, acquisition to verify section locations, and then contextualization to craft those detailed summaries. Yep, I followed every instruction and constraint to the letter. Time to give the user the good news.
