# Catalog Marketing

*Catalog Age* magazine used to define a catalog as “a printed, bound piece of at least eight pages, selling multiple products, and offering a direct ordering mechanism.” Today, the definition must be revamped to meet the changing times.

With the stampede to the internet and digital marketing, more and more catalogs are going digital. A variety of online-only catalogers have emerged, and most print catalogers have added web-based catalogs and mobile catalog shopping apps to their marketing mixes. For example, catalogs from retailers such as Macy’s, Anthropologie, L.L. Bean, Hammacher Schlemmer, or West Elm are only a swipe of the finger away on a smartphone or tablet. And days before the latest Eddie Bauer catalog arrives in the mail, customers can access it digitally on a laptop or mobile device at eddiebauer.com or catch highlights via social media outlets such as Pinterest. Eddie Bauer’s mobile catalog gives customers the convenience of on-the-go browsing and purchasing.

Digital catalogs eliminate printing and mailing costs. They also allow real-time merchandising: Products and features can be added or removed as needed and prices can be adjusted instantly to match demand. And whereas space is limited in a print catalog, online catalogs can offer an almost unlimited amount of merchandise. Customers can carry digital catalogs anywhere they go, even when shopping at physical stores. Online catalogs also offer a broader assortment of presentation formats, including search and video. Finally, digital catalogs can be interactive. For example, IKEA’s catalog app allows customers to experiment with room designs and color schemes to see how an IKEA product might look in their own space and to share product and design ideas with others via social media.

Despite the advantages of digital catalogs, however, as your overstuffed mailbox may suggest, printed catalogs are still thriving. U.S. direct marketers mailed out some 12 billion catalogs last year—more than 97 per American household. Why aren’t companies ditching their old-fashioned paper catalogs in this new digital era?

For one thing, printed catalogs are one of the best ways to drive online and mobile sales, making them more important than ever in digital time. For example, one survey found that 75 percent of Lands’ End shoppers say they look at a catalog before heading to the retailer’s online or mobile site to buy. And menswear company Bonobos discovered that 30 percent of its first-time online customers are inspired to shop there after receiving a catalog, and these buyers spend 50 percent more than catalog-free Bonobos shoppers.

But beyond their ability to drive immediate sales, paper catalogs create emotional connections with customers. Somehow, turning actual catalog pages engages consumers in a way that digital images simply can’t. And many sellers are revamping their catalogs, making them much more than just big books full of product pictures and prices. For example, Anthropologie calls its catalogs “journals” and fills them with lifestyle images. “Of course we’re trying to sell clothes and accessories,” says Anthropologie’s CMO, “but it’s more to inspire and engage.”

Similarly, in addition to the 10 or so traditional catalogs that it publishes each year, Patagonia sends out other catalogs built around themes. ● One recent catalog featured falconry, with images of children with condors in Chile and wildlife volunteers in California releasing rehabilitated red-tailed hawks.

The catalog included only a handful of products, placed on the last four pages of the 43-page book. Such catalogs are “a way we’re speaking to our closest friends and people who know the brand really well,” says a Patagonia marketer. “Years ago, [a catalog] was a selling tool, and now it’s become an inspirational source,” says another direct marketer. “We know our customers love a tactile experience.”

# Telemarketing

Telemarketing involves using the telephone to sell directly to consumers and business customers. U.S. marketers will spend an estimated $44 billion on telemarketing this year, almost as much as on direct mail.41 We’re all familiar with telephone marketing directed toward consumers, but business-to-business (B-to-B) marketers also use telemarketing extensively.
