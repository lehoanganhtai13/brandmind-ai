# Chapter 3 | Analyzing the Marketing Environment

to drink.³⁷ Renewable resources, such as forests and food, also have to be used wisely. Nonrenewable resources, such as oil, coal, and various minerals, pose a serious problem. Firms making products that require these scarce resources face large cost increases even if the materials remain available.

A second environmental trend is *increased pollution*. Industry will almost always damage the quality of the natural environment. Consider the disposal of chemical and nuclear wastes; the dangerous mercury levels in the ocean; the quantity of chemical pollutants in the soil and food supply; and the littering of the environment with nonbiodegradable bottles, plastics, and other packaging materials.

A third trend is *increased government intervention* in natural resource management. The governments of different countries vary in their concern and efforts to promote a clean environment. Some, such as the German government, vigorously pursue environmental quality. Others, especially many poorer nations, do little about pollution, largely because they lack the needed funds or political will.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created in 1970 to create and enforce pollution standards and conduct pollution research. In the future, companies doing business in the United States can expect continued strong controls from government and pressure groups. Instead of opposing regulation, marketers should help develop solutions to the materials and energy problems facing the world.

> **Environmental sustainability**  
> Developing strategies and practices that create a world economy that the planet can support indefinitely.

Concern for the natural environment has spawned an **environmental sustainability** movement. Today, enlightened companies go beyond what government regulations dictate. They are developing strategies and practices that create a world economy that the planet can support indefinitely. Environmental sustainability means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Many companies are responding to consumer demands with more environmentally responsible products. Others are developing recyclable or biodegradable packaging, recycled materials and components, better pollution controls, and more energy-efficient operations. Nike is not only committed to its economic objectives but positions itself as an advocate of sustainability. To that end, it tries to reduce its environmental impact through its value chain. Its key focus is to create a new generation of goods for maximum athletic performance but minimal environmental impact, an ethos that is held across all of its products. Nike thus transformed £54 million worth of factory scrap into premium materials that were used to make its performance footwear and apparel in fiscal year 2015. Without energy recovery, it diverted 92 percent of the total waste from landfill and incineration in its footwear production. The company launched its energy and carbon program in 2008, and since then, its footwear contract manufacturers have succeeded in cutting energy use per unit in half. Nike is also proud to state that 95 percent of the materials used in its production passed its restricted substance list testing. It hopes that by 2020 it will minimize its environmental footprint through a 10 percent reduction in the average environmental footprint and the elimination of waste from footwear manufacturing being consigned to incineration and landfill. It also hopes to achieve a 20 percent reduction in freshwater use in its finishing and dyeing of textile per unit of production. Ultimately, it is focused on achieving 100 percent renewable energy in its owned and operated facilities through FY25.³⁸
