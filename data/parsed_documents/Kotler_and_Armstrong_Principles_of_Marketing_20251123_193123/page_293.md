# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

brands of powdered laundry soap are Tide and Gain; the leading brands 100 years ago were Fels-Naptha and Octagon.

The PLC concept also can be applied to what are known as styles, fashions, and fads. Their special life cycles are shown in **Figure 9.3**. A **style** is a basic and distinctive mode of expression. For example, styles appear in homes (colonial, ranch, transitional), clothing (formal, casual), and art (realist, surrealist, abstract). Once a style is invented, it may last for generations, passing in and out of vogue. A style has a cycle showing several periods of renewed interest.

A **fashion** is a currently accepted or popular style in a given field. For example, the more formal “business attire” look of corporate dress of the 1980s and 1990s gave way to the “business casual” look of the 2000s and 2010s. Fashions tend to grow slowly, remain popular for a while, and then decline slowly.

**Fads** are temporary periods of unusually high sales driven by consumer enthusiasm and immediate product or brand popularity. A fad may be part of an otherwise normal life cycle, as in the case of recent surges in the sales of poker chips and accessories. Or the fad may comprise a brand’s or product’s entire life cycle. Pet Rocks are a classic example. Upon hearing his friends complain about how expensive it was to care for their dogs, advertising copywriter Gary Dahl joked about his pet rock. He soon wrote a spoof of a dog-training manual for it, titled *The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock*. Soon Dahl was selling some 1.5 million ordinary beach pebbles at $4 a pop. Yet the fad, which broke one October, had sunk like a stone by the next February. Dahl’s advice to those who want to succeed with a fad: “Enjoy it while it lasts.” Other examples of fads include Silly Bandz, Furbies, and selfie sticks.

Marketers can apply the product life-cycle concept as a useful framework for describing how products and markets work. And when used carefully, the PLC concept can help in developing good marketing strategies for the different life-cycle stages. However, using the PLC concept for forecasting product performance or developing marketing strategies presents some practical problems. For example, in practice, it is difficult to forecast the sales level at each PLC stage, the length of each stage, and the shape of the PLC curve. Using the PLC concept to develop marketing strategy also can be difficult because strategy is both a cause and a result of the PLC. The product’s current PLC position suggests the best marketing strategies, and the resulting marketing strategies affect product performance in later stages.

Moreover, marketers should not blindly push products through the traditional product life-cycle stages. Instead, marketers often defy the “rules” of the life cycle and position or reposition their products in unexpected ways. By doing this, they can rescue mature or declining products and return them to the growth phase of the life cycle. Or they can leapfrog obstacles that slow consumer acceptance and propel new products forward into the growth phase.

The moral of the product life cycle is that companies must continually innovate; otherwise, they risk extinction. No matter how successful its current product lineup, a company must skillfully manage the life cycles of existing products for future success. And to grow, the company must develop a steady stream of new products that bring new value to customers. Cosmetics giant L’Oréal had to learn this lesson as well. The company’s makeup brand L’Oréal Paris has a long history in the market. In recent years, however, as its core brand was close to reaching the maturity stage, L’Oréal’s sales were outperformed by new players on the market, making the company re-position its makeup brand (see Real Marketing 9.2).

We looked at the product development stage of the PLC in the first part of this chapter. We now look at strategies for each of the other life-cycle stages.

This table illustrates the distinct lifecycles of Style, Fashion, and Fad, all represented in relation to Sales over Time. Style exhibits a relatively stable sales trajectory, suggesting enduring appeal. Fashion shows a more pronounced but still sustained sales curve, indicating a trend with a longer lifespan. In contrast, Fad demonstrates a rapid and sharp increase in sales, followed by an equally swift decline, highlighting its ephemeral nature. The examples provided, such as the Pet Rock and low-carb diets, exemplify this characteristic short-lived, intense popularity of fads. The visual representation of sales over time, depicted by polylines, clearly differentiates the duration and intensity of these three concepts.
