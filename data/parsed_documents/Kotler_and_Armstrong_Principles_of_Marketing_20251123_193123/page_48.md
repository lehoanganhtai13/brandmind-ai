# Digital and Social Media Marketing

Branded online communities: Petco’s Community site is a place where pet lovers can connect, share, and learn via a blog and discussion boards dedicated to pets of all types, from dogs and cats to birds, fish, and reptiles. Petco

The age of the *Internet of Things* (IoT), a global environment where everything and everyone is digitally connected to everything and everyone else. More than 3.3 billion people—46 percent of the world’s population—are now online; 64 percent of all American adults own smartphones. These numbers will only grow as digital technology rockets into the future.  
Most consumers are totally smitten with all things digital. For example, according to one study, 71 percent of Americans keep their mobile phone next to them when they sleep; 3 percent sleep with phone in hand. In just the past few years, people in the United States averaged more time per day with digital media (5.25 hours) than viewing traditional TV (4.5 hours).

The consumer love affair with digital and mobile technology makes it fertile ground for marketers trying to engage customers. So it’s no surprise that the internet and rapid advances in digital and social media have taken the marketing world by storm. **Digital and social media marketing** involves using digital marketing tools such as websites, social media, mobile ads and apps, online video, email, blogs, and other digital platforms to engage consumers anywhere, anytime via their computers, smartphones, tablets, internet-ready TVs, and other digital devices. These days, it seems that every company is reaching  
out to customers with multiple websites, newsy tweets and Facebook pages, viral ads and videos posted on YouTube, rich-media emails, and mobile apps that solve consumer problems and help them shop.

At the most basic level, marketers set up company and brand websites that provide information and promote the company’s products. Many companies also set up branded community sites, where customers can congregate and exchange brand-related interests and information. For example, Petco’s Community site is a place “where pet lovers can connect, share, and learn” via a blog and discussion boards dedicated to dogs (“the bark”), cats (“the purr”), fish (“the splash”), birds (“the chirp”), reptiles (“the hiss”), and other types of pets. And Sony’s PlayStation Forums site serves as a social hub for PlayStation PS4 game enthusiasts. It’s a place where fans can follow social media posts about PS4, watch the latest PS4 videos, discover which PS4 games are trending on social networks, share content, and interact with other fans—all in real time.  
Beyond brand websites, most companies are also integrating social and mobile media into their marketing mixes.

## Social Media Marketing

It’s hard to find a brand website, or even a traditional media ad, that doesn’t feature links to the brand’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or other social media sites. Social media provide exciting opportunities to extend customer engagement and get people talking about a brand.

Some social media are huge—Facebook has more than 1.59 billion active monthly members. Instagram has more than 400 million active monthly users, Twitter has more than 315 million monthly users, Google+ racks up 300 million active monthly visitors, and Pinterest draws in more than 100 million users. Reddit, the online social news community, has 234 million unique visitors each month from 185 countries. But smaller, more focused social media sites are also thriving, such as CafeMom, an online community of 20 million moms who exchange advice, entertainment, and commiseration at the community’s online, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, Google+, and mobile sites. Even tiny sites can attract active audiences, such as Birdpost.com for avid birdwatchers or Ravelry.com for knitters and crocheters.

Online social media provide a digital home where people can connect and share important information and moments in their lives. As a result, they offer an ideal platform for *real-time marketing*, by which marketers can engage consumers in the moment by linking brands to important trending topics, real-world events, causes, personal occasions, or other important happenings in consumers’ lives (see Real Marketing 1.2).
