# Understanding the Marketplace and Consumer Value

these kids are just beginning to have their own personal style and are also beginning to influence their parents in their purchases,” says a North Face marketer. To engage kids even further, The North Face recently launched a design contest in which it invited young would-be artists ages 6 to 12 to submit new apparel and gear designs that represent what the brand’s “Never Stop Exploring” mantra means to them. The 10 winners will see their artwork featured in the brand’s youth collection. “Kids are our main source of inspiration,” says a Youth Design Team marketer. “It’s important that we make things that are ‘fun,’ and how fun would it be to have kids help design our product?” Such engagement efforts have helped to make The North Face one of today’s hottest brands among teens and tweens.

An important Generation Z marketing concern involves children’s privacy and their vulnerability to marketing pitches. Companies marketing to this group must do so responsibly or risk the wrath of parents and public policy makers.

**Generational Marketing.** Do brands need to create separate products and marketing programs for each generation? Some experts warn that marketers need to be careful about turning off one generation each time they craft a product or message that appeals effectively to another. Others caution that each generation spans decades of time and many socioeconomic levels. For example, marketers often split the baby boomers into three smaller groups—leading-edge boomers, core boomers, and trailing-edge boomers—each with its own beliefs and behaviors. Similarly, they split Generation Z into kids, tweens, and teens.

Thus, marketers need to form more precise age-specific segments within each group. More important, defining people by their birth date may be less effective than segmenting them by lifestyle, life stage, or the common values they seek in the products they buy. We will discuss many other ways to segment markets in Chapters 5 and 7.

## The Changing American Family

The traditional household consists of a husband, wife, and children (and sometimes grandparents). Yet the historic American ideal of the two-child, two-car suburban family has lately been losing some of its luster.

In the United States, fewer than half of today’s households contain married couples, down from 76 percent in 1940. Married couples with children under 18 represent only 19 percent of the nation’s 125 million households. Married couples without children represent 23 percent, and single parents are another 14 percent. A full 34 percent are nonfamily households—singles living alone or unrelated adults of one or both sexes living together.[19]

More people are divorcing or separating, choosing not to marry, marrying later, remarrying, or marrying without intending to have children. Currently, 15 percent of all new marriages are interracial or interethnic, and 7.3 percent of same-sex couple households are raising children.[20] The changing composition of today’s modern American families is increasingly reflected in popular movies and television shows, such as *Modern Family*, the award-winning TV sitcom about an extended nontraditional family. Marketers must consider the special needs of nontraditional households because they are now growing more rapidly than traditional households. Each group has distinctive needs and buying habits.
