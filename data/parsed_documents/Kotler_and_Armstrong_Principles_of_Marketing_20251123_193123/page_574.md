In recent years, as the weakened global economy has slowed growth in both domestic and emerging markets, many companies are shifting their sights to include a new target—the so-called “bottom of the economic pyramid,” the vast untapped market consisting of the world’s poorest consumers (see Real Marketing 19.1).

These days, companies in a wide range of industries—from cars to computers to soft drinks—are increasingly targeting middle-income or low-income consumers in subsistence and emerging economies. For example, as soft drink sales growth has lost its fizz in North America and Europe, Coca-Cola has had to look elsewhere to meet its ambitious growth goals. So the company has set its sights on Africa, with its promising though challenging long-term growth opportunities. Many Western companies view Africa as an untamed final frontier, plagued by poverty, political instability, unreliable transportation, and shortages of fresh water and other essential resources. But Coca-Cola sees plenty of opportunity to justify the risks. The African continent has a growing population of more than 1.1 billion people, a just-emerging middle class, and $2.4 trillion of GDP and spending power. Six of the world’s 10 fastest-growing markets are in Africa:[^16]

Coca-Cola has operated in Africa since 1929 and holds a dominant 29 percent market share in Africa and the Middle East, compared with Pepsi’s 15 percent share. However, there’s still plenty of room for Coca-Cola to grow there. For example, annual per capita consumption of Coke and other soft drinks is about 13 times less in Africa than in North America. Still, marketing in Africa is very different from marketing in more developed regions. Beyond just marketing through traditional channels in larger African cities, Coca-Cola is now invading smaller communities with more grassroots tactics.

Small stores play a big role in helping Coca-Cola to grow in Africa. ● In countless poor neighborhoods across the continent, crowded streets are lined with shops painted Coke red, selling low-priced Coca-Cola products by the bottle out of Coke-provided, refrigerated coolers. Such shops are supplied by a rudimentary but effective network of Coca-Cola distributors, whose crews often deliver crates of Coke products by hand-pulled trolleys or even a crate at a time carried on their heads. Because of the poor roads crowded with traffic, moving drinks by hand is often the best method. The company’s first rule is to get its products “cold and close.” “If they don’t have roads to move products long distances on trucks, we will use boats, canoes, or trolleys,” says the president of Coca-Cola South Africa. For example, in Nigeria’s Makako district—a maze of stilt houses on the Lagos lagoon—women crisscross the waterways in canoes selling Coca-Cola directly to residents.

## Political-Legal Environment

Nations differ greatly in their political-legal environments. In considering whether to do business in a given country, a company should consider factors such as the country’s attitudes toward international buying, government bureaucracy, political stability, and monetary regulations.

Some nations are very receptive to foreign firms; others are less accommodating. For example, India has tended to bother foreign businesses with import quotas, currency restrictions, and other limitations that make operating there a challenge. In contrast, neighboring Asian countries such as Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand court foreign investors and shower them with incentives and favorable operating conditions. Political and regulatory stability is another issue. For example, Russia is consumed by corruption and governmental red tape, which the government finds difficult to control. The country’s recent geopolitical conflicts with Europe, the United States, and other countries have made doing business in Russia difficult and risky.[^17]

Companies must also consider a country’s monetary regulations. Sellers want to take their profits in a currency of value to them. Ideally, the buyer can pay in the seller’s currency or in other world currencies. Short of this, sellers might accept a blocked currency—one whose removal from the country is restricted by the buyer’s government—if Many companies are now waking up to a shocking statistic.
