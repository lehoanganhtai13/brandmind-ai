# 9.2 Managing L’Oréal’s Product Life Cycle: More Than Just Makeup

Founded in 1909, L’Oréal has devoted itself to one business over the century: beauty. Headquartered in Clichy near Paris, the company has become the largest cosmetics company worldwide, operating in 140 countries with 32 international brands. Its mother brand, L’Oréal Paris, is the no. 1 beauty brand in the world.

In the increasingly dynamic environment of the cosmetic industry, L’Oréal has to ensure a continuous and sophisticated management of the life cycle of its products and services to bring new value and appeal to its customers. By tradition, the makeup market has long been driven by classic mass marketing brands such as Maybelline New York and Max Factor. In addition, competition is intensified by brands selling directly to customers, such as Avon, and, in particular, low-cost brands such as Essence and Kiko. While competition is fierce and challenging, the makeup market is growing fast. To a large extent this growth is driven by so-called makeup artist brands, which are product lines initially used by professionals or named after famous makeup artists such as MAC, Benefit, and Bobby Brown. There are also many makeup brands that wear the names of perfume or luxury ready-to-wear brands, such as Shiseido, Chanel, or Yves Saint Laurent.

L’Oréal’s makeup brand L’Oréal Paris has a long tradition of 30 years in the market, and it currently ranks no. 2 in the global market after Maybelline New York. The makeup market encountered a strong growth of 50 percent in the 10 years between 2003 and 2012. Even though L’Oréal’s makeup brand performed better than the market with a significant market share increase, it was outperformed by the makeup artist brands. With respect to the product life cycle, the L’Oréal makeup brand was close to the maturity phase, as the competition was fierce, profits were slowing down, and the brand’s customers were aging. An initial analysis of the market and its competitors indicated that the two fastest growing types of brands—makeup artist brands and low-cost brands—had something in common: a very large variety of colors that appealed to customers. Although L’Oréal’s makeup brand was still performing, the company realized that this might not be sustainable enough in the future to compete with its rivals. By tradition, the brand was particularly strong when it comes to foundation and mascara products but has been increasingly challenged by the fashionable segment of color variety and selection.

Yann Joffredo, Global Vice-President Cosmetics L’Oréal Paris, emphasized that the traditional market had shifted and that today’s women shop “looks” rather than products. As a result, conventional channels are no longer the only key in this new era of internet sales, cross-channel purchasers and connected beauty. Instead of pursuing an exit strategy and dropping out of the makeup market like Nivea did in 2011, L’Oréal wanted to continue building its makeup brand and avoid the decline stage. In order to achieve this target, the company looked into various market research reports and conducted a battery of tests. One study carried out in Europe showed that L’Oréal Paris was seen as a trustworthy brand whose products were highly effective and innovative, enhancing beauty in an elegant manner while bringing self-esteem to women. However, the study also discovered that the brand was not seen as the most dynamic and trendy in the industry, particularly when it comes to the younger generation, who claim that L’Oréal did not offer the right shades. All findings were analyzed in-depth in order to determine the right strategy with respect to competition and the marketing environment while still hewing close to the company’s culture and values.

L’Oréal decided to choose a different positioning from the low-cost brands. Without the cost structure that L’Oréal has, with a team of over 3,800 researchers, the latter would always win the battle of inexpensiveness. Consequently, the idea was to learn from the makeup artist brands’ success by repositioning the brand and developing an innovative color statement that appealed to young consumers. L’Oréal Paris established a new strategy platform, moving from a generalist brand to a multi-specialist one. In 2014, the name of the brand was changed to L’Oréal Makeup Designer Paris.

The value proposition is that the products are developed and endorsed by the greatest makeup artists and spokespeople. The brand is positioned on three pillars: L’Art du Regard (The Art of Looks), L’Architecture du Teint (The Architecture of Complexion), and L’Obsession de la Couleur (Color Obsession).
