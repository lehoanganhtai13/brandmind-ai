# 1.1 Buffalo Wild Wings: Fueling the Sports Fan Experience

“Wings. Beer. Sports.” That’s the long-standing motto for the fast-growing Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant chain. “B-Dubs”—as it’s known to avid regulars—focuses on food and sports and “everything in between.”

There’s no doubt about it. Buffalo Wild Wings more than lives up to the “wings” and “beer” parts of the equation. It serves up wings in an abundant variety: boned or boneless, with five dry seasonings and 17 signature sauces ranging on the heat scale from Sweet BBQ (traditional BBQ sauce: satisfyingly sweet with no heat) to Desert Heat (smoky, sweet, and chili pepper seasoning) to Reformulated Blazin’ (so good, it’s scary—made with the unrelenting heat of the ghost pepper). To wash it all down, each B-Dubs restaurant pours as many as 30 different draft beers, with a full selection of domestic, import, and craft beer brands. You won’t go hungry or thirsty at B-Dubs.

However, the Buffalo Wild Wings recipe for success goes much deeper than just selling wings and beer for profit. What really packs ’em in and keeps ’em coming back is the B-Dubs customer *experience*. Customers do gobble up the wings—more than 11 million wings chain-wide on last Super Bowl Sunday alone. But even more important, they come to B-Dubs to watch sports, trash talk, cheer on their sports teams, and meet old friends and make new ones—that is, a total eating and social experience. “We realize that we’re not just in the business of selling wings,” says the company. “We’re something much bigger. We’re in the business of fueling the sports fan experience. Our mission is to WOW people every day!”

Everything about B-Dubs is designed to deliver the ultimate sports experience, for any fan of any sport. The WOW begins the minute you step into any of Buffalo Wild Wings’s 1,100 restaurants. This is not your average dark-and-dank sports bar. Instead, a B-Dubs is like a miniature stadium, with high ceilings, ample natural light, and brightly colored furnishings and wall coverings. The newest Buffalo Wild Wings “Stadia” restaurants are divided into barrier-free zones—including a bar area and a separate dining area. And every B-Dubs has 60 to 70 really big flat-screen TVs lining the walls, over the bar, and about everywhere else, ensuring that every table has the best seat in the house no matter what your team or sport, including live streaming of local college and even high school events. B-Dubs creates an exciting environment that makes it the next best thing to being at the game—or something even better. “We consider ourselves to have 1,100 stadiums,” says the chain’s vice president for guest experience and innovation.

There’s an experience for everyone at Buffalo Wild Wings. The chain appeals to a wide range of customers, from pub-loving sports nuts to families looking for an affordable evening out. Singles and couples gravitate to the bar area; families stick to the carpeted areas with booths. In addition to streaming sports events of all kinds on the big screens, B-Dubs supplies tableside tablets upon which customers can play poker or trivia games. A social jukebox feature lets guests control the music that plays on the restaurant’s sound system.

It seems like there’s always something happening in a B-Dubs to engage customers and enhance the experience. Take the chain’s infamous Blazin’ Wing Challenge—which promises a trophy-style T-shirt and a place on the Wall of Fame to any customer who can down a dozen wings with the chain’s hottest signature sauce in no more than six minutes. That’s no easy feat considering that the Blazin’ sauce is 60 times hotter than typical jalapeño sauce. During the six-minute binge, challengers are not allowed to use napkins or utensils, touch their faces, or eat or drink anything other than the wings (no dipping sauces, please). The menu boasts plenty of warnings, and servers advise most people not to even attempt the challenge. And before taking the plunge, each challenger signs a waiver agreeing that he or she “voluntarily assumes all risk of loss, damage, injury, illness, or death that may be sustained by him or her as a result.” As you can imagine, when a challenge is announced over the PA, it usually draws a crowd.

Buffalo Wild Wings never rushes its guests. Whereas many other casual-dining restaurants have a “turn-and-burn” philosophy—cycling as many paying guests as possible through each table—at B-Dubs it’s just the opposite. Buffalo Wild Wings encourages people to linger longer, enjoy the food, and soak up the ambiance.

To help make that happen, the chain has created a new staff position at each restaurant. In addition to the usual waitstaff, each table has a “Guest Experience Captain.” According to B-Dubs’s chief marketer, the captain is “like a host at any party,” moving from table to table, chatting with guests, personalizing their experiences, and making sure their needs are met.
