The results have been spectacular. Thanks to its blue-ocean strategy, Cirque du Soleil is now the undisputed leader in the redefined circus industry. In only its first 20 years, the company achieved more revenues than Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey achieved in its first 100 years. Recently, however, as traditional circuses have updated their acts and smaller Cirque-like rivals have emerged, Cirque du Soleil’s blue ocean “is now full of sharks,” says a company executive. Cirque du Soleil must continue to find innovative new ways to separate itself from competitors in bringing value to customers.⁸

## Designing a Competitive Intelligence System

We have described the main types of information that companies need about their competitors. This information must be collected, interpreted, distributed, and used. Gathering competitive intelligence can cost much money and time, so the company must design a cost-effective competitive intelligence system.

The competitive intelligence system first identifies the vital types of competitive information needed and the best sources of this information. Then the system continuously collects information from the field (sales force, channels, suppliers, market research firms, internet and social media sites, online monitoring, and trade associations) and published data (government publications, speeches, and online databases). Next the system checks the information for validity and reliability, interprets it, and organizes it in an appropriate way. Finally, it sends relevant information to decision makers and responds to inquiries from managers about competitors.

With this system, company managers receive timely intelligence about competitors in the form of reports and assessments, posted bulletins, newsletters, and email and mobile alerts. Managers can also connect when they need to interpret a competitor’s sudden move, know a competitor’s weaknesses and strengths, or assess how a competitor will respond to a planned company move.

# Competitive Strategies

Having identified and evaluated its major competitors, a company now must design broad marketing strategies by which it can gain competitive advantage. But what broad competitive marketing strategies might the company use? Which ones are best for a particular company or for the company’s different divisions and products?

## Approaches to Marketing Strategy

No one strategy is best for all companies. Each company must determine what makes the most sense given its position in the industry and its objectives, opportunities, and resources. Even within a company, different strategies may be required for different businesses or products. Johnson & Johnson uses one marketing strategy for its leading brands in stable consumer markets, such as BAND-AID, Tylenol, Listerine, or J&J’s baby products, and a different marketing strategy for its high-tech health-care businesses and products, such as Monocryl surgical sutures or NeuFlex finger joint implants.

Companies also differ in how they approach the strategy-planning process. Many large firms develop formal competitive marketing strategies and implement them religiously. However, other companies develop strategy in a less formal and orderly fashion. Some companies, such as Harley-Davidson, Red Bull, and Shinola, succeed by breaking many of the rules of marketing strategy. Such companies don’t operate large marketing departments, conduct expensive marketing research, spell out elaborate competitive strategies, and spend huge sums on advertising. Instead, they sketch out strategies on the fly, stretch their limited resources, live close to their customers, and create more satisfying solutions to customer needs. They form buyers’ clubs, use buzz marketing, engage customers up close, and focus on winning customer loyalty. It seems that not all marketing must follow in the footsteps of marketing giants such as P&G, McDonald’s, and Microsoft.
