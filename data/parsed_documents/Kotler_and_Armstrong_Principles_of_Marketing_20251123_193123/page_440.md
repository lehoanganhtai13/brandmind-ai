# Shaping the Overall Promotion Mix

The concept of integrated marketing communications suggests that the company must blend the promotion tools carefully into a coordinated *promotion mix*. But how does it determine what mix of promotion tools to use? Companies within the same industry differ greatly in the design of their promotion mixes. For example, cosmetics maker Mary Kay spends most of its promotion funds on personal selling and direct marketing, whereas competitor CoverGirl spends heavily on consumer advertising. We now look at factors that influence the marketer’s choice of promotion tools.

> **Author Comment:** In this section, we’ll look at how marketers blend the various marketing communication tools into a smooth-functioning, integrated, and engaging promotion mix.

## The Nature of Each Promotion Tool

Each promotion tool has unique characteristics and costs. Marketers must understand these characteristics in shaping the promotion mix.

**Advertising.** Advertising can reach masses of geographically dispersed buyers at a low cost per exposure, and it enables the seller to repeat a message many times. Television advertising can reach huge audiences. For example, more than 111 million Americans watched the most recent Super Bowl, and as many as 18 million avid fans tuned in each week for the latest season of *NCIS*. What’s more, a popular TV ad’s reach can be extended through online and social media. 

● For example, consider the commercial for Supercell’s popular mobile game “Clash of Clans: Revenge” starring Liam Neeson, which aired during Super Bowl XLIX. In addition to the more than 100-plus million TV viewers, it became the most-viewed Super Bowl ad on YouTube for the year, capturing a stunning 82 million YouTube views by year’s end. Thus, for companies that want to reach a mass audience, TV is the place to be.¹⁵

Beyond its reach, large-scale advertising says something positive about the seller’s size, popularity, and success. Because of advertising’s public nature, consumers tend to view advertised products as more legitimate. Advertising is also very expressive; it allows the company to dramatize its products through the artful use of visuals, print, sound, and color. On the one hand, advertising can be used to build up a long-term image for a product (such as Coca-Cola ads). On the other hand, advertising can trigger quick sales (as when Kohl’s advertises weekend specials).

Advertising also has some shortcomings. Although it reaches many people quickly, mass-media advertising is impersonal and lacks the direct persuasiveness of company salespeople. For the most part, advertising can carry on only a one-way communication with an audience, and the audience does not feel that it has to pay attention or respond. In addition, advertising can be very costly. Although some advertising forms—such as newspaper, radio, or online advertising—can be done on smaller budgets, other forms, such as network TV advertising, require very large budgets. For example, the one-minute “Clash of Clans: Revenge” Super Bowl ad cost $9 million for media time alone, not counting the costs of producing the ad. That’s $150,000 per tick of the clock.

**Personal Selling.** Personal selling is the most effective tool at certain stages of the buying process, particularly in building up buyers’ preferences, convictions, and actions. It involves personal interaction.
