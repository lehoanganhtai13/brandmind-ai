Of course, even in highly standardized communications campaigns, some adjustments might be required for language and cultural differences. For example, ads for Pepsi’s youthful “Live for Now” campaign have a similar look worldwide but are adapted in different global markets to feature local consumers, languages, and events. Similarly, in Western markets, fast-casual clothing retailer H&M runs fashion ads with models showing liberal amounts of bare skin. But in the Middle East, where attitudes toward public nudity are more conservative, the retailer runs the same ads digitally adapted to better cover its models.

Global companies often have difficulty crossing the language barrier, with results ranging from mild embarrassment to outright failure. Seemingly innocuous brand names and advertising phrases can take on unintended or hidden meanings when translated into other languages. For example, Interbrand of London, the firm that created household names such as Prozac and Acura, recently developed a brand name “hall of shame” list, which contained these and other foreign brand names you’re never likely to see inside the local Kroger supermarket: Krapp toilet paper (Denmark), Plopp chocolate (Scandinavia), Crapsy Fruit cereal (France), Poo curry powder (Argentina), and Pschitt lemonade (France). Similarly, advertising themes often lose—or gain—something in the translation. In Chinese, the KFC slogan “finger-lickin’ good” came out as “eat your fingers off.” And Motorola’s Hellomoto ringtone sounds like “Hello, Fatty” in India.

Marketers must be watchful to avoid such mistakes, taking great care when localizing their brand names and messages to specific global markets. In important but culturally different markets such as China, finding just the right name can make or break a brand:

> After a long day’s work, an average upscale Beijinger can’t wait to dash home, lace on a comfortable pair of Enduring and Persevering, pop the top on a refreshing can of Tasty Fun, then hop into his Dashing Speed and head to the local tavern for a frosty glass of Happiness Power with friends.  
> Translation? In China, those are the brand name meanings for Nike, Coca-Cola, Mercedes, and Heineken, respectively. To Westerners, such names sound pretty silly, but to brands doing business in China, they are no laughing matter. Perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, brand names in China take on deep significance.

Ideally, to maintain global consistency, the Chinese name should sound similar to the original while at the same time conveying the brand’s benefits in meaningful symbolic terms. Nike’s Chinese brand name, Nai ke, does this well. Not only does it sound the same when pronounced in Chinese, its “enduring and persevering” meaning powerfully encapsulates the “Just Do It” essence of the Nike brand the world over. Similarly, P&G’s Tide is Taizi in China, which translates to “gets out the dirt,” a perfect moniker for a tough-acting detergent. Other names that wear well on Chinese ears while also conveying a brand’s essence include Lay’s snack foods—Le shi (“happy things”); Reebok—Rui bu (“quick steps”); and Colgate—Gau lu jie (“revealing superior cleanliness”).[^42]

Rather than standardizing their advertising globally, other companies follow a strategy of **communication adaptation**, fully adapting their advertising messages to local markets. For example, in the United States and most Western countries, where running is accepted as a positive, healthful activity, Nike advertising focuses on products and personal performance. In China, however, running is viewed as a boring sport or even a punishment—something rigorous and painful. It’s not something that most people in Asia’s polluted cities choose to do, especially on streets jammed with pedestrians, bicycles, cars, and even rickshaws. “The joke is that when there’s a person running in the city (and it’s often a Westerner), people turn to see who’s chasing him,” quips one observer.

However, China is the largest footwear market in the world, offering huge untapped potential for Nike. So, in China, rather than pushing products and performance, Nike’s advertising focuses on just trying to get more Chinese to put on running shoes. Ads and social media feature ordinary people who choose to run on city streets, letting them relate their reasons in their own words. “I run to make the hidden visible,” says one young woman. “I run to get lost,” says another. Salad—a stressed-out office worker who lives and runs in Shanghai—relates: “The city is always noisy and busy. This adds even more pressure to my day. I guess for me, running is about shutting down the noise.” To make
