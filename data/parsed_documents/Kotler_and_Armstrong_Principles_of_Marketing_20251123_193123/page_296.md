# Maturity Stage

At some point, a product’s sales growth will slow down, and it will enter the **maturity stage**. This maturity stage normally lasts longer than the previous stages, and it poses strong challenges to marketing management. Most products are in the maturity stage of the life cycle, and therefore most of marketing management deals with the mature product.

The slowdown in sales growth results in many producers with many products to sell. In turn, this overcapacity leads to greater competition. Competitors begin marking down prices, increasing their advertising and sales promotions, and upping their product development budgets to find better versions of the product. These steps lead to a drop in profit. Some of the weaker competitors start dropping out, and the industry eventually contains only well-established competitors.

Although many products in the mature stage appear to remain unchanged for long periods, most successful ones are actually evolving to meet changing consumer needs. Product managers should do more than simply ride along with or defend their mature products—a good offense is the best defense. They should consider modifying the market, product offering, and marketing mix.

In *modifying the market*, the company tries to increase consumption by finding new users and new market segments for its brands. For example, brands such as Harley-Davidson and Axe fragrances, which have typically targeted male buyers, have created products and marketing programs aimed at women. Conversely, Weight Watchers and Bath & Body Works, which have typically targeted women, have created products and programs aimed at men.

The company may also look for ways to increase usage among present customers. For example, 3M recently ran a marketing campaign to inspire more usage of its Post-it products. The Post-it “Go Ahead” campaign aimed to convince customers that the sticky pieces of paper are good for much more than just scribbling temporary notes and reminders. An initial ad showed people on a college campus blanketing a wall outside a building with Post-it Notes answering the question “What inspires you?” “Share on a real wall,” the announcer explained. Other scenes showed a young man filling a wall with mosaic artwork created from multiple colors of Post-it Notes, teachers using Post-it Notes to enliven their classrooms, and a man posting a “Morning, beautiful” note on the bathroom mirror as his wife is brushing her teeth. “Go ahead,” said the announcer, “keep the honeymoon going.” The ad ended with a hand peeling Post-it Notes off a pad one by one to reveal new, unexpected uses: “Go ahead, Connect,” “Go ahead, Inspire,” and “Go ahead, Explore.”

The company might also try *modifying the product*—changing characteristics such as quality, features, style, packaging, or technology platforms to retain current users or attract new ones. Thus, to freshen up their products for today’s technology-obsessed children, many classic toy and game makers are creating new digital versions or add-ons for old favorites. For example, the venerable Crayola brand has souped up its product line to meet the technology tastes of the new generation. With the Crayola My Virtual Fashion Show drawing kit and app, for instance, children first design fashions using the provided color pencils and sketchpad. They then take photos of the designs with their smartphones or tablets and watch their original creations magically come to life inside the app on 3D models who walk virtual runways in Milan, New York, and Paris.

Finally, the company can try *modifying the marketing mix*—improving sales by changing one or more marketing mix elements. The company can offer new or improved services to buyers. It can cut prices to attract new users and competitors’ customers. It can launch a better advertising campaign or use aggressive sales promotions—trade deals, cents-off, premiums, and contests. In addition to pricing and promotion, the company can also move into new marketing channels to help serve new users.
