In addition, the company has a team of technical specialists known as the Takumi Team, boasting many years of experience in the Japanese textile industry. These specialists are sent directly to UNIQLO’s partner factories in China to offer technical instruction and share their abundant experience. At the same time, the supervisors from the production department, based in the Shanghai office, make weekly visits to partner factories to check the quality and progress of production.

Moreover, UNIQLO has continuously innovated in functional materials through collaborations with manufacturers and suppliers as well as customers. For example, it developed a heat-generating material known as HEATTECH with Toray Industries, Inc. Launched in 2003, HEATTECH is a unique, highly functional line of innerwear that preserves body warmth and has won over a multitude of customers. As customer opinions and needs play a vital role in UNIQLO’s product development strategy, its HEATTECH products have been continuously refined each year based on customer feedback. The UNIQLO Customer Center receives approximately 100,000 comments from customers annually and it is precisely this customer feedback that makes it possible for UNIQLO to produce the high-quality apparel that it does.

In addition to the affordable prices of UNIQLO products, their trendy designs help attract customers. UNIQLO partners with renowned artists and designers from across the globe, such as German designer Jil Sander. Following a five-year absence from designing, she created a collection for UNIQLO named +J, which was launched globally and sold out in most countries in the first week. In order to position UNIQLO as a socially functional brand and not just another fashion brand, the company appoints influential brand ambassadors like chef David Chang, technology entrepreneur David Karp of Tumblr, jazz musician Esperanza Spalding, professional tennis player Novak Djokovic, and Australian golfer Adam Scott.

Another positive characteristic that UNIQLO has integrated is the world-renowned Japanese characteristic of attentiveness in customer service. At UNIQLO stores, there are “advisors” who help customers find what they need and keep the store neat and tidy at all times. Advisors are trained to project the UNIQLO way of interacting with customers.

Fast Retailing continues to revolutionize the retail clothing industry by creating innovative retail experiences. In 2013, UNIQLO’s joint project with the New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) successfully boosted the company’s visibility worldwide by enabling UNIQLO to offer a range of sweatshirts and T-shirts with cutting-edge design from both contemporary artists and established pop masters like Andy Warhol. For Fall 2015, UNIQLO announced Magic for All, a global partnership with Disney Consumer Products. In the future, the company aims at revolutionizing the retail business further by constructing state-of-the-art distribution centers, starting in Tokyo, in order to create an entirely new way of shopping: If a store runs out of a particular product a customer wants, UNIQLO can order it from their virtual store and deliver it to that customer by the time they get home.

Fast Retailing aims to achieve consolidated Group sales of $61.2 billion by 2020 with a continuous growth rate of 20 percent per year in order to become the world’s biggest specialty retailer of private label apparel. In a growing global environment in which cheap and chic also means looking and feeling good, UNIQLO has definitely found the best cut in fabric.¹
