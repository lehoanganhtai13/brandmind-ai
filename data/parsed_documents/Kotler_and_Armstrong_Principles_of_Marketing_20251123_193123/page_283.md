# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

LinkedIn takes the process a step further with its InCubator program, under which employees can form teams each quarter that pitch innovative new ideas to LinkedIn executives. If approved, the team gets up to 90 days away from its regular work to develop the idea into reality.⁶

## External Idea Sources

Companies can also obtain good new product ideas from any of a number of external sources. For example, *distributors and suppliers* can contribute ideas. Distributors are close to the market and can pass along information about consumer problems and new product possibilities. Suppliers can tell the company about new concepts, techniques, and materials that can be used to develop new products.

*Competitors* are another important source. Companies watch competitors’ ads to get clues about their new products. They buy competing new products, take them apart to see how they work, analyze their sales, and decide whether they should bring out a new product of their own. Other idea sources include trade magazines, shows, websites, and seminars; government agencies; advertising agencies; marketing research firms; university and commercial laboratories; and inventors.

Perhaps the most important sources of new product ideas are *customers* themselves. The company can analyze customer questions and complaints to find new products that better solve consumer problems. Or it can invite customers to share suggestions and ideas.

For example, The LEGO Group systematically taps users for new product ideas and input via the LEGO Ideas website:⁷

At the LEGO Ideas website, the giant toy maker turns user ideas into new LEGO building sets. The site invites customers to submit their ideas and to evaluate and vote on the ideas of others. Ideas supported by 10,000 votes head to the LEGO Review Board for an internal review by various departments including marketing and design. Ideas passing the review are made into official LEGO products. Customers whose ideas reach production earn 1 percent of total net sales of the product and receive credit as the LEGO Ideas set creator inside every set sold. So far, LEGO Ideas has resulted in 12 major new products, including the likes of LEGO *Doctor Who*, LEGO Birds, LEGO *Big Bang Theory*, LEGO *Ghostbusters*, LEGO WALL•E, LEGO *Back to the Future* DeLorean Time Machine, and the LEGO Labyrinth Marble Maze.

## Crowdsourcing

More broadly, many companies are now developing crowdsourcing or open-innovation new product idea programs. Through **crowdsourcing**, a company invites broad communities of people—customers, employees, independent scientists and researchers, and even the public at large—into the innovation process. Tapping into a breadth of sources—both inside and outside the company—can produce unexpected and powerful new ideas.

Companies large and small, across all industries, are crowdsourcing product innovation ideas rather than relying only on their own R&D labs. For example, sports apparel maker Under Armour knows that no matter how many top-notch developers it has inside, sometimes the only way to produce good outside-the-box ideas is by going outside the company. So in its quest to find the Next Big Thing, Under Armour sponsors an annual crowdsourcing competition called the Future Show Innovation Challenge:⁸

> The Future Show challenge invites entrepreneurs and inventors from around the nation to submit new product ideas. Then, from thousands of entries, an Under Armour team culls 12 finalists who go before a panel of seven judges to pitch their products in a splashy, *Shark Tank*–like reality TV setting. The winner earns $50,000 and a contract to work with Under Armour to help develop *Crowdsourcing: Under Armour sponsors an annual crowdsourcing competition called the Future Show Innovation Challenge, in which it invites outside innovators to pitch new product ideas in a splashy,* *Shark Tank*–like reality TV setting.
