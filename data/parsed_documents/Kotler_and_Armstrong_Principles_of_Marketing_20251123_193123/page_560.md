# Creating Competitive Advantage

PURRsonals.com pairs cat lovers—it’s where “cat lovers meet and greet.” SeaCaptainDate.com helps lovers of the ocean “find your first mate.” Faith-focused ChristianMingle.com is “where good people find great relationships.” And TallFriends.com brings tall people nose to nose (there’s even a choice for people taller than 6’11”!). If that’s not niche enough for you, maybe you need a super-nicher such as GlutenfreeSingles.com, with 4,000 love-seeking gluten-free users. There’s even a dating site for mustache wearers and people who love them (StachePassions.com).

Although some of these niche sites seem a bit extreme, they can be ideal for people who think they know precisely what kind of person they want.  
For example, FarmersOnly.com serves hundreds of thousands of country-folk members every day seeking like-minded mates with rural persuasions. Farmers Only founder Jerry Miller started the dating site after noticing that the isolated and demanding farming lifestyle makes it hard to find understanding partners. He cites an example in which a country girl and her city boyfriend discussed marriage. Their relationship went to seed when she said that she wanted to raise horses; he said they could keep the horses in the garage. At that point, says Miller, “She knew they were not compatible.” Hence the dating service’s popular tagline: FarmersOnly.com, because “City folks just don’t get it.”

A market nicher can specialize along any of several market, customer, product, or marketing mix lines. For example, it can specialize in serving one type of *end user*, as when a law firm specializes in the criminal, civil, or business law markets. The nicher can specialize in serving a given *customer-size* group. Many nichers specialize in serving small and midsize customers who are neglected by the majors.

Some nichers focus on one or a few *specific customers*, selling their entire output to a single company, such as Walmart or General Motors. Still other nichers specialize by *geographic market*, selling only in a certain locality, region, or area of the world. For example, Vegemite is primarily sold and consumed in Australia. *Quality-price* nichers operate at the low or high end of the market. For example, Manolo Blahnik specializes in the high-quality, high-priced women’s shoes. Finally, *service nichers* offer services not available from other firms. For example, LendingTree provides online lending and realty services, connecting homebuyers and sellers with national networks of mortgage lenders and realtors who compete for the customer’s business. “When lenders compete,” it proclaims, “you win.”

Niching carries some major risks. For example, the market niche may dry up, or it might grow to the point that it attracts larger competitors. That is why many companies practice *multiple niching*. By developing two or more niches, a company increases its chances for survival. Even some large firms prefer a multiple niche strategy to serving the total market. For example, apparel maker VF Corporation markets more than 30 premium lifestyle brands in niche markets ranging from jeanswear, sportswear, and contemporary styles to outdoor gear and imagewear (workwear). For example, VF’s Vans unit creates footwear, apparel, and accessories for skate-, surf-, and snowboarders. Its 7 for All Mankind brand offers premium denim and accessories sold in boutiques and high-end department stores. The North Face and Timberland brands offer top-of-the-line gear and apparel for outdoor enthusiasts. In contrast, the company’s Red Kap, Bulwark, and Chef Designs workwear brands provide an array of uniforms and protective apparel for businesses and public agencies, whether it’s outfitting a police force or a chef’s crew. Together, these separate niche brands combine to make VF a $12.4-billion apparel powerhouse. No matter who you are, says the company, “We fit your life.”[^21]

## Balancing Customer and Competitor Orientations

Whether a company is the market leader, challenger, follower, or nicher, it must watch its competitors closely and find the competitive marketing strategy that positions it most effectively. And it must continually adapt its strategies to the fast-changing competitive ----
