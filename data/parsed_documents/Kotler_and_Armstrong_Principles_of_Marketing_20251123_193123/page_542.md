In the year 2000—due largely to the collapse of the stock market technology bubble—Microsoft’s value plummeted by 60 percent. And whereas other tech stocks recovered, Microsoft’s share price and profits languished at early 2000’s levels for a dozen years or more.

Over the past few years, however, in an attempt to align itself better with the new digital world order and the host of new competitors, Microsoft has undergone a dramatic transformation in its vision and competitive strategy. Microsoft now wants to be a full-line digital devices and services company that delivers “delightful, seamless technology experiences” that connect people to communication, productivity, entertainment, and one another.

Under this new competitive strategy, Microsoft has unleashed a flurry of new, improved, or acquired digital products and services. Over the past few years, it has introduced new versions of Windows and Office that serve not just computers but also tablets and smartphones, a next-generation Xbox console that doubles as a TV, a music and movie service to rival iTunes and Google Play, an upgraded version of Skype, the OneDrive cloud storage solution, and even innovative new digital hardware—the Microsoft Surface tablet and Microsoft Surface Book laptop—that it hopes will lead the way to even more innovative Windows devices.

But these new individual offerings don’t begin to tell the full story of Microsoft’s transformation. More important is the way that these software, hardware, and service offerings work together to deliver a full digital experience. It all revolves around Windows 10, a dramatic digital-age metamorphosis from previous Windows versions. Windows 10 employs colorful, interactive tiles and touchscreen navigation, with interactive features that compete head-on with the systems of rivals Apple, Google, and Amazon. Best of all, Windows 10 works seamlessly across desktops and laptops, tablets, phones, and even the company’s own Xbox, providing the cloud-based connectivity that today’s users covet.

Using Windows 10 software and apps with Windows-based devices and cloud computing services, you can select a movie from a tablet, start playing it on the TV or Xbox, and finish watching it on your phone, pausing to call or text a friend using Skype. What you do on one Windows device is automatically updated on other devices. Playlists created or songs and TV programs purchased from a mobile device will be waiting for you on your home PC or laptop. And Windows 10 is a social creature; for example, it updates contacts automatically with tweets and photos from friends. The new Windows seems to be pushing all the right digital buttons for customers. In its first eight months, it was placed on 270 million active devices, making it the most successful launch in Windows’s nearly 30-year history.

The latest version of Microsoft Office—Office 365—has also been transformed for the connected age. Office 365 positions Microsoft’s venerable productivity suite as a service, not just standalone software. With an annual subscription, you get the latest version of Office, a terabyte of cloud storage on OneDrive, 60 minutes of Skype calls per month, free updates and new features, and free tech support by phone or chat through the Microsoft Answer Desk. Microsoft also released an Office version for Apple devices. So Office now works across devices, operating systems, and the cloud, making it easier than ever to stay connected with others and to create and share documents on the go.

Perhaps Microsoft’s biggest about-face is the development of its own hardware devices. In the past, the company has relied on partners like Dell, HP, and Nokia to develop the PCs, tablets, and phones that run its software. But to gain better control in today’s superheated digital and mobile markets, Microsoft is now doing its own development of Windows-enabled devices.

For starters, Microsoft developed the cutting-edge Surface tablet, a unique combination of tablet and mini-laptop. More recently, it released its first dedicated laptop, the Surface Book, which goes head-to-head with the Apple MacBook Pro. Microsoft is also dabbling seriously with mobile phones, first buying then selling phone maker Nokia and now rumored to soon be introducing a Windows-based Surface phone of its own. The Surface line, along with Xbox, will give Microsoft better control of access to three important digital screens beyond the PC—tablets, TVs, and phones.

Microsoft’s revamped competitive strategy also plays to the company’s long-held competitive advantage in business markets as the company plunges headlong into new business products and services. In addition to flexible bundling of its Windows, Office, and Enterprise Mobility Suite for business customers, Microsoft now offers Azure, a “cloud for modern business.” And it recently acquired Yammer, a web-services provider and hip maker of business social networking tools—a sort of Facebook for businesses. Finally, Microsoft is now exploring a wide range of futuristic digital technologies, from intelligent chatbots, machine learning, and augmented/virtual reality to Internet of Things applications.

In the fast-changing digital environment, Microsoft is revamping its competitive strategy to make itself a brand that consumers can’t live without in the post-PC world.
