Today’s successful companies have one thing in common: Like Emirates, they are strongly customer focused and heavily committed to marketing. These companies share a passion for satisfying customer needs in well-defined target markets. They motivate everyone in the organization to help build lasting customer relationships based on creating value.

Customer relationships and value are especially important today. Facing dramatic technological advances and deep economic, social, and environmental challenges, today’s customers are reassessing how they engage with brands. New digital, mobile, and social media developments have revolutionized how consumers shop and interact, in turn calling for new marketing strategies and tactics. It’s now more important than ever to build strong customer engagement, relationships, and advocacy based on real and enduring customer value.

We’ll discuss the exciting new challenges facing both customers and marketers later in the chapter. But first, let’s introduce the basics of marketing.

## What Is Marketing?

Marketing, more than any other business function, deals with customers. Although we will soon explore more-detailed definitions of marketing, perhaps the simplest definition is this one: *Marketing is engaging customers and managing profitable customer relationships.* The two-fold goal of marketing is to attract new customers by promising superior value and to keep and grow current customers by delivering value and satisfaction.

For example, Nike leaves its competitors in the dust by delivering on its promise to inspire and help everyday athletes to “Just do it.” Amazon dominates the online marketplace by creating a world-class online buying experience that helps customers to “find and discover anything they might want to buy online.” Facebook has attracted more than 1.5 billion active web and mobile users worldwide by helping them to “connect and share with the people in their lives.” And Coca-Cola has earned an impressive 49 percent global share of the carbonated beverage market—more than twice Pepsi’s share—by fulfilling its “Taste the Feeling” motto with products that provide “a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special.”²
