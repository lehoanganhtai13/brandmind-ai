One recent survey found that 90 percent of consumers now multitask while watching TV and that millennials and Gen X consumers engage in an average of three additional media activities while watching television, including internet browsing, text messaging, and reading email. Although some of this multitasking is related to TV viewing—such as looking up related product and program information—most multitasking involves tasks unrelated to the shows or ads being watched. Marketers need to take such media interactions into account when selecting the types of media they will use.21

### Selecting Specific Media Vehicles

Media planners must also choose the best media vehicles—specific media within each general media type. For example, television vehicles include *Modern Family* and *ABC World News Tonight*. Magazine vehicles include *Time*, *Real Simple*, and *ESPN The Magazine*. Online and mobile vehicles include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.

Media planners must compute the cost per 1,000 persons reached by a vehicle. For example, if a full-page, four-color advertisement in the U.S. national edition of *Forbes* costs $163,413 and *Forbes*’s readership is 900,000 people, the cost of reaching each group of 1,000 persons is about $181. The same advertisement in *Bloomberg Businessweek*’s Northeast U.S. regional edition may cost only $48,100 but reach only 155,000 people—at a cost per 1,000 of about $310.22 The media planner ranks each magazine by cost per 1,000 and favors those magazines with the lower cost per 1,000 for reaching target consumers. In the previous case, if a marketer is targeting Northeast business managers, *Bloomberg Businessweek* might be the more cost-effective buy, even at a higher cost per thousand.

Media planners must also consider the costs of producing ads for different media. Whereas newspaper ads may cost very little to produce, flashy television ads can be very costly. Many online and social media ads cost little to produce, but costs can climb when producing made-for-the-web video and ad series.

In selecting specific media vehicles, media planners must balance media costs against several media effectiveness factors. First, the planner should evaluate the media vehicle’s audience quality. For a Huggies disposable diapers ad, for example, *Parents* magazine would have a high exposure value; men’s lifestyle magazine *Maxim* would have a low exposure value. Second, the media planner should consider audience engagement. Readers of *Vogue*, for example, typically pay more attention to ads than do *Time* readers. Third, the planner should assess the vehicle’s editorial quality. *Time* and *The Wall Street Journal* are more believable and prestigious than *Star* or the *National Enquirer*.

### Deciding on Media Timing

An advertiser must also decide how to schedule the advertising over time. Suppose sales of a product peak in December and drop in March (for winter outdoor gear, for instance). The firm can vary its advertising to follow the seasonal pattern, oppose the seasonal pattern, or be the same all year. Most firms do some seasonal advertising. For example, weight-loss product and service marketers tend to heavy up after the first of the year, targeting consumers who let their appetites get the better of them over the holiday season. Weight Watchers, for instance, spends more than a quarter of its annual advertising budget in January. 

By contrast, Peeps, the perennial Easter favorite marshmallow chicks and bunnies candies, launched an “Every Day Is a Holiday” campaign to broaden demand beyond Easter, which accounts for an estimated 70 percent of the brand’s business. The campaign now promotes Peeps at Valentine’s Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holiday seasons. Some marketers do *only* seasonal advertising: For instance, P&G advertises its Vicks NyQuil only during the cold and flu season.23

Today’s online and social media let advertisers create ads that respond to events in real time. For example, Lexus recently introduced a new model through live streaming from the North American International Auto Show via Facebook’s News Feed. Some 100,000
