# OBJECTIVES OUTLINE

This content outlines four key objectives related to international marketing. Objective 19-1 focuses on understanding the influence of the international trade system and the economic, political-legal, and cultural environments on a company's international marketing decisions. Objective 19-2 addresses the description of three primary approaches for entering international markets. Objective 19-3 explains how companies modify their marketing strategies and mixes to suit international markets. Finally, Objective 19-4 involves identifying the three main organizational structures for international marketing. These objectives collectively map out a structured approach to global marketing, moving from understanding the external environment and market entry strategies to adapting marketing programs and organizing for international operations.

Thanks to such cultural understandings coupled with competitively low prices, China is now IKEA’s fastest-growing market. Eight of the world’s 10 biggest IKEA stores are in China. What do Chinese consumers think of Swedish meatballs? “They love them,” says IKEA China’s marketing director.¹

**IN THE PAST, U.S. COMPANIES** paid little attention to international trade. If they could pick up some extra sales via exports, that was fine. But the big market was at home, and it teemed with opportunities. The home market was also much safer. Managers did not need to learn other languages, deal with strange and changing currencies, face political and legal uncertainties, or adapt their products to different customer needs and expectations. Today, however, the situation is much different. Organizations of all kinds, from Coca-Cola and Nike to Google, Facebook, and even the NBA, have gone global.

> **Author Comment:** The rapidly changing global environment provides both opportunities and threats. It’s difficult to find a marketer today that isn’t affected in some way by global developments.

# Global Marketing Today

The world is shrinking rapidly with the advent of faster digital communication, transportation, and financial flows. Products developed in one country—McDonald’s hamburgers, Netflix video service, Samsung electronics, Zara fashions, Caterpillar construction equipment, German BMWs, Facebook social networking—have found enthusiastic acceptance in other countries. It would not be surprising to hear about a German businessman wearing an Italian suit meeting an English friend at a Japanese restaurant who later returns home to drink Russian vodka while watching *The Big Bang Theory* on TV and checking Facebook posts from friends around the world.

International trade has boomed over the past three decades. Since 1990, the number of multinational corporations in the world has more than doubled to more than 65,000. Some of these multinationals are true giants. In fact, of the largest 150 economies in the world, only 88 are countries. The remaining 62 are multinational corporations. Walmart, the world’s largest company (based on a weighted average of sales, profits, assets, and market value), has annual revenues greater than the gross domestic product (GDP) of all but the world’s 26 largest countries.² Despite a dip in world trade caused by the recent worldwide recession, the global trade of products and services last year was valued at $16.5 trillion, about 22 percent of GDP worldwide.³

* Many U.S. companies have long been successful at international marketing: Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Starbucks, Nike, GE, IBM, Apple, Google, Colgate, Caterpillar, Boeing, and dozens of other American firms have made the world their market. In the United States, Many American companies have now made the world their market.
