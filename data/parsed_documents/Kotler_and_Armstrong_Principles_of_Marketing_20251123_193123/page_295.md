Therefore, the new positioning and strategy was primarily driven by the creation of the revolutionary Makeup Genius App, an easy-to-use smartphone IOS application that gives customers the ability to “shop” their look instantly.

Thanks to head and expression tracking features as well as face texture 3D analysis, this application enabled users to be the designers of their own looks through a real-time interactive mirror. In addition, L’Oréal Paris developed a fully integrated digital approach in order to bring valuable services to consumers, inspiring conversations and building relationships through social media platforms. The campaign kicked off on three continents, starting in France, the United States, and China in May 2014 and then rolled out to 20 countries. Cyril Chapuy, L’Oréal Paris International General Manager, stated that the strategy successfully positioned the company at the vanguard of creativity and fashion. As a result, L’Oréal has grown its followers tenfold at the global level in the past 2 years. Its Makeup Genius has become the first beauty app in the world and has been downloaded over 10 million times since May 2014. Since then, the company has started to see a strong acceleration of its sales.

In all, L’Oréal has successfully repositioned and relaunched its makeup brand by managing the product life cycle in a sophisticated way. By entering a new era of digital beauty through its Makeup Genius App, L’Oréal successfully lives up to its ambition of creating tomorrow’s beauty services.

### Introduction Stage

**Introduction stage**  
The PLC stage in which a new product is first distributed and made available for purchase.

The **introduction stage** starts when a new product is first launched. Introduction takes time, and sales growth is apt to be slow. Well-known products such as frozen foods and HDTVs lingered for many years before they entered a stage of more rapid growth.

In this stage, as compared to other stages, profits are negative or low because of the low sales and high distribution and promotion expenses. Much money is needed to attract distributors and build their inventories. Promotion spending is relatively high to inform consumers of the new product and get them to try it. Because the market is not generally ready for product refinements at this stage, the company and its few competitors produce basic versions of the product. These firms focus their selling on those buyers who are the most ready to buy.

A company, especially the *market pioneer*, must choose a launch strategy that is consistent with the intended product positioning. It should realize that the initial strategy is just the first step in a grander marketing plan for the product’s entire life cycle. If the pioneer chooses its launch strategy to make a “killing,” it may be sacrificing long-run revenue for the sake of short-run gain. The pioneer has the best chance of building and retaining market leadership if it plays its cards correctly from the start.

### Growth Stage

**Growth stage**  
The PLC stage in which a product’s sales start climbing quickly.

If the new product satisfies the market, it will enter a **growth stage** in which sales will start climbing quickly. The early adopters will continue to buy, and later buyers will start following their lead, especially if they hear favorable word of mouth. Attracted by the opportunities for profit, new competitors will enter the market. They will introduce new product features, and the market will expand. The increase in competitors leads to an increase in the number of distribution outlets, and sales jump just to build reseller inventories. Prices remain where they are or decrease only slightly. Companies keep their promotion spending at the same or a slightly higher level. Educating the market remains a goal, but now the company must also meet the competition.

Profits increase during the growth stage as promotion costs are spread over a large volume and as unit manufacturing costs decrease. The firm uses several strategies to sustain rapid market growth as long as possible. It improves product quality and adds new product features and models. It enters new market segments and new distribution channels. It shifts some advertising from building product awareness to building product conviction and purchase, and it lowers prices at the right time to attract more buyers.

In the growth stage, the firm faces a trade-off between high market share and high current profit. By spending a lot of money on product improvement, promotion, and distribution, the company can capture a dominant position. In doing so, however, it gives up maximum current profit, which it hopes to make up in the next stage.
