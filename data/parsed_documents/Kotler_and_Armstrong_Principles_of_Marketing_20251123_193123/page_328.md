# Video Case Fast-Food Discount Wars

McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, and others are constantly trying to lure customers at the low end of the price spectrum with tempting menu options that can serve as a snack or a meal. Although this technique is nothing new, it’s more popular today than ever. The tactic has even found its way into full-service restaurant chains such as Olive Garden.  
But are bargain-basement options a sustainable path for restaurant chains? This video takes a look at the various ways discount menus are executed. It also considers the reasons for using discount menu tactics as well as the possible negative outcomes.

* **10-16** Discuss why a restaurant chain might employ a discount menu as a pricing option.  
* **10-17** What are the possible negative outcomes of employing a discount menu strategy?  

# Company Case MSC Cruises: From One Second-Hand Ship to a Major World Player

In 1970, Italian Gianluigi Aponte founded the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) with a single second-hand ship and just $5,000 in capital to move cargo between Europe and Africa. Despite a challenging, price-based competitive environment, MSC has since prospered and grown to become the world’s second-largest container operator behind Maersk, with a fleet of over 400 ships and operations in 150 countries.  

MSC ventured into passenger cruises in 1989 with the acquisition of Lauro Lines, a division they would later rebrand as MSC Cruises. By 2003 they had recognized that they could not successfully compete in the growing cruising sector with the low-cost second-hand ship approach that had worked so well in their shipping container division, so they embarked on a substantial new-ship investment program.  
Today they have 12 new luxury cruise ships in operation and are the world’s fourth-largest cruise operator and the leading cruise brand in Europe. They plan to become the world’s third-largest cruise line by 2025.

## Reinvention of the Cruising Industry

Cruise ships were initially designed for overseas transport and were popular for that purpose up to the 1960s, when long-range air travel became more affordable for the broader market. At the time it appeared that the era of mass passenger ship travel was over, surpassed by superior technology of airlines, which were able to provide faster, cheaper, and more flexible travel options.  
And this was the case for the next 30 years or so, as cruise ships essentially targeted affluent retirees looking for an upmarket experience. While this may be an attractive segment from a profit perspective, the market lacked size and growth potential. For example, in 1990 less than 4 million people worldwide went on a cruise.  

Around this time, major cruise operators started to consider how they could compete in the broader holiday market. They certainly didn’t have the speed advantages or the choice of destinations of airlines, nor did they have the facilities of hotels and resorts—so how could they compete?  
The answer lay in the reinvention of the industry to be halfway between a form of transport and a resort, essentially repositioning cruise ships from transportation vehicles to mobile holiday destinations.  
This has been delivered over time through the design of new, larger ships that incorporate shops, restaurants and bars, entertainment, swimming pools, waterslides, casinos, movie theaters, and even rock climbing and ice skating. The bulk of the cabins are now constructed on the outside of the ships, where most of them have their own balcony.  

These resort-style facilities, combined with the experience of visiting several countries during a one-week cruise, help provide consumers with a unique holiday experience that cannot be directly matched by their non-cruise competitors. The result of the industry’s transition to essentially be the destination itself is that demand has substantially increased. By 2004 there were 9 million passengers worldwide and an estimated 24 million people on cruises in 2016.  

The significant increase in passenger numbers is a result of improved cruise ship facilities, the increased choice of destinations, the growing word-of-mouth influence of satisfied customers, and an overall reduction in price (ships have become larger, providing greater opportunities for economies of scale).

## The Major Players

The other major driver of the cruise industry has been the shift towards a more concentrated market. In the 1970s and 1980s there were around 30 cruise brands. But today 80 percent of the market is controlled by three corporations. For instance, the market leader in the international cruise industry is the Carnival Corporation, which runs 10 brands of cruise ships, including Carnival, Princess, P&O, Cunard and Holland. Across these brands, Carnival operates just over 100 ships, with a combined passenger market share of 48 percent in 2015.  

Royal Caribbean Cruises is the number two player in the market, and in third position is Norwegian Cruise Lines. MSC Cruises is now the fourth-largest cruise line ahead of Disney, holding 5 percent market share across their ships. Unlike their larger competitors, MSC operates their entire fleet under one brand.

## Demographic Segmentation

Effective market segmentation of potential cruise passengers is an effective way to grow market share. In the cruise industry, the common approach to demographic segmentation is to split the market into five segments; namely, families, singles, honeymoon or romantic couples, seniors, and the disabled.  

These market segments have different preferences for the on-board facilities and processes. For example, families seek flexible dining experiences and on-board service and activities, whereas seniors are more price-sensitive (as they are more likely to be regular repeat cruise line passengers) and more interested in entertainment.
