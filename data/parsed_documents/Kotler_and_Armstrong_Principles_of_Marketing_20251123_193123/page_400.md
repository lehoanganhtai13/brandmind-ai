Some even become “Costcoholics,” as one reporter’s story illustrates:

> A good friend of mine was raving about Costco recently, going on about how she couldn’t resist shopping there at least two to three times a week. She said sometimes she doesn’t even plan on buying anything. She just loves wandering around in the enormous, double-football-field-sized warehouse, hunting for what’s new. She is also obsessed by what the big luxury “surprise” of the week might be—stuff like Waterford Crystal, Coach handbags, or Omega watches, to name a few, all selling out quickly at shock-and-awe low prices. And even though she may have shopped with no intention of purchasing, she says she always finds something that seduces her to buy.

There was a time when only the great unwashed masses shopped at off-price retailers. But Costco has changed all that. Even people who don’t have to pinch pennies shop there. Not by accident, Costco’s stores tend to be located in more affluent locations than Sam’s Clubs. The average Costco member has a household income of nearly $100,000.

Costco’s flair even extends to its store brand—Kirkland Signature. Whereas the Sam’s Club Member’s Mark store brand covers a limited assortment of generic-priced food, household, and apparel lines, Costco puts the Kirkland Signature brand on a much wider range of goods. Customers seek out Kirkland Signature products not just for price but also for quality. Costco customers can buy anything from a $19 bottle of Kirkland Signature Series Mendoza Malbec red wine to a $2,299 Kirkland Signature Braeburn five-piece woven fire pit patio set to a $3,799-per-person, seven-day Kirkland Signature river cruise package in France.

So, in its own warehouse club retailing backyard, it’s Costco, not Walmart, that’s beating up on competitors. In fact, mighty but frustrated Walmart has spent years trying to make Sam’s Club more Costco-like. Costco is much more than a big-box store that “stacks ’em high and sells ’em cheap”—more than just a place to load up on large sizes of consumer staples. Each Costco store is a theater of retail that creates buying urgency and excitement for customers.

In many ways, retailing boils down to the unglamorous art of getting the right product in the right place at the right time at the right price. But there’s a lot more than that to Costco’s value proposition. Says Costco founder and former CEO Jim Sinegal: “Do that without being boring. That’s the trick.”

However, franchising covers a lot more than just burger joints and fitness centers. Franchises have sprung up to meet just about any need. For example, Mad Science Group franchisees put on science programs for schools, scout troops, and birthday parties. Soccer Shots offers programs that give kids ages two to eight an introduction to basic soccer skills at daycare centers, schools, and parks. Mr. Handyman provides repair services for homeowners, while Merry Maids tidies up their houses. Supercuts offers affordable, anytime, walk-in haircuts, and H&R Block provides tax-preparation services.  
● More than one-third of H&R Block’s 12,000 retail offices are owned and operated by franchisees.¹¹

Franchises now command about 45 percent of all retail sales in the United States. These days, it’s nearly impossible to stroll down a city block or drive on a city street without seeing a McDonald’s, Subway, Jiffy Lube, or Hampton Inn. One of the best-known and most successful franchisers, McDonald’s, now has more than 36,000 stores in more than 100 countries, including more than 14,000 in the United States. It serves 69 million customers a day and racks up more than $98 billion in annual system-wide sales. More than 80 percent of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by franchisees.¹²
