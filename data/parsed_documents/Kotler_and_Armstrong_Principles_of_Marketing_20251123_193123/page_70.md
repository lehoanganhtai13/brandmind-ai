# Chapter 2 | Company and Marketing Strategy

In addition, the company has established a “Red Bull Music Academy,” the music label “Red Bull Records,” several “Red Bull Music Studios,” “Red Bull Music Academy Radio,” and even mobile phone service operations branded “Red Bull Mobile” in a number of nations. In fact, the company can be found in a number of business sectors, from TV broadcasting to youth academies and football clubs. The company has thus diversified into other businesses that have synergy with its brand image.

Red Bull today has become a close-knit brand community that engages customers with both products and absorbing brand content. Beyond its products, Red Bull produces a steady stream of event and social media content that engages and entertains brand fans. During the last few years, for example, Red Bull’s Media House unit has filmed movies, signed a deal with NBC for a show called Red Bull Signature Series, developed reality-TV ideas with big-name producers, become one of YouTube’s biggest partners in publishing original content, and loaded its own web and mobile sites with unique content features. Werner Brell, who heads the Red Bull Media House Unit, stated that all of Red Bull’s events have been put on film or photographed. The goal is to be able to tell engaging stories.

Since its early start, Red Bull has created a business portfolio which best fits the company’s strengths and weaknesses to opportunities in the external environment. By focusing on a niche and mainly one product only, the company displays what successful business portfolio management in the form of niche marketing is all about—a well-defined brand engaging a focused customer community with meaningful brand relationships that even larger and more resourceful competitors can’t crack. Through smart niche and business portfolio management, Red Bull has given its customers—and itself—new wings and a whole new shot of energy.

The horizontal axis, *relative market share* serves as a measure of company strength in the market. The growth-share matrix defines four types of SBUs:

1. **Stars.** Stars are high-growth, high-share businesses or products. They often need heavy investments to finance their rapid growth. Eventually their growth will slow down, and they will turn into cash cows.  
2. **Cash cows.** Cash cows are low-growth, high-share businesses or products. These established and successful SBUs need less investment to hold their market share. Thus, they produce a lot of the cash that the company uses to pay its bills and support other SBUs that need investment.  
3. **Question marks.** Question marks are low-share business units in high-growth markets. They require a lot of cash to hold their share, let alone increase it. Management has to think hard about which question marks it should try to build into stars and which should be phased out.  
4. **Dogs.** Dogs are low-growth, low-share businesses and products. They may generate enough cash to maintain themselves but do not promise to be large sources of cash.

The 10 circles in the growth-share matrix represent the company’s 10 current SBUs. The company has two stars, two cash cows, three question marks, and three dogs. The area of each circle is proportional to the SBU’s dollar sales. This company is in fair shape, although not in good shape. It wants to invest in the more promising question marks to make them stars and maintain the stars so that they will become cash cows as their markets mature. Fortunately, it has two good-sized cash cows. Income from these cash cows will help finance the company’s question marks, stars, and dogs. The company should take some decisive action concerning its dogs and its question marks.

Once it has classified its SBUs, the company must determine what role each will play in the future. It can pursue one of four strategies for each SBU. It can invest more in the business unit to *build* its share. Or it can invest just enough to *hold* the SBU’s share at the current level. It can *harvest* the SBU, milking its short-term cash flow regardless of the long-term effect. Finally, it can *divest* the SBU by selling it or phasing it out and using the resources elsewhere.

As time passes, SBUs change their positions in the growth-share matrix. Many SBUs start out as question marks and move into the star category if they succeed. They later become cash cows as market growth falls and then finally die off or turn into dogs toward the end of the life cycle. The company needs to add new products and units continuously so that some of them will become stars and, eventually, cash cows that will help finance other SBUs.
