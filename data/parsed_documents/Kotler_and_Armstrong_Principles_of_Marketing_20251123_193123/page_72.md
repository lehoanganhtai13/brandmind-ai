# FIGURE 2.3  
The Product/Market Expansion Grid

This table illustrates the Ansoff Matrix, a strategic framework for product and market growth. It categorizes growth strategies based on whether they involve existing or new products and existing or new markets. The four strategies presented are: Market Penetration, which focuses on increasing market share with existing products in existing markets; Product Development, involving the creation of new products for existing markets; Market Development, which entails entering new markets with existing products; and Diversification, representing the most significant risk, involving new products in new markets. The matrix provides a structured approach to understanding the strategic options available to businesses for expansion.

> Companies can grow by developing new markets for existing products. For example, Under Armour recently stepped up its marketing to women consumers and is expanding rapidly in international markets.

> Through diversification, companies can grow by starting or buying businesses outside their current product/markets. For example, Under Armour has entered the digital personal health and fitness market by acquiring three fitness app companies.

## Market penetration  
Company growth by increasing sales of current products to current market segments without changing the product.

## Market development  
Company growth by identifying and developing new market segments for current company products.

## Product development  
Company growth by offering modified or new products to current market segments.

## Diversification  
Company growth through starting up or acquiring businesses outside the company’s current products and markets.

doubled, making it the nation’s second-best-selling apparel brand behind Nike. Looking forward, the company must look for new ways to keep growing.

First, Under Armour might consider whether the company can achieve deeper **market penetration** — making more sales in its current product lines and markets. It can spur growth through marketing mix improvements — adjustments to its product design, advertising, pricing, and distribution efforts. For example, Under Armour offers an ever-increasing range of styles and colors in its original apparel lines. And it recently boosted its spending on advertising and professional athlete and team endorsements by 35 percent over previous years. The company has also added direct-to-consumer distribution channels, including its own retail stores and sales websites. Direct-to-consumer sales have tripled over the past eight years and now account for some 30 percent of total revenues.

Second, Under Armour might consider possibilities for **market development** — identifying and developing new markets for its current products. Under Armour can review new *demographic markets*.  
* For instance, the company recently stepped up its marketing to women consumers, with new products and a highly acclaimed $15 million women-focused promotion campaign called “I Will What I Want.”  
* Under Armour can also pursue new *geographical markets*. For example, the brand is rapidly making a name for itself in international markets, including Japan, Europe, Canada, and Latin America. It recently opened its first-ever brand store in China. Although Under Armour’s international sales grew 70 percent last year, they still account for only 12 percent of total sales, leaving plenty of room for international growth.

Third, Under Armour can consider **product development** — offering modified or new products to current markets. For example, the company added athletic shoes to its apparel lines in 2006, and it continues to introduce innovative new athletic-footwear products, such as the recently added Under Armour SpeedForm line. Sneaker sales rose 44 percent last year yet still account for only about 13 percent of total sales, again leaving plenty of growth potential.

Finally, Under Armour can consider **diversification** — starting up or buying businesses outside of its current products and markets. For example, the company recently expanded into the digital personal health and fitness tracking market by acquiring three fitness app companies — MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal, and Endomondo. It has also partnered with IBM to add artificial fitness tracking technologies that connect fitness, sleep, and nutrition to its products and bind consumers to the brand via technology and services rather than just apparel. Under Armour might also consider moving into nonperformance leisurewear or begin making and marketing Under Armour fitness equipment. When diversifying, companies must be careful not to overextend their brands’ positioning.
