# Marketing Return on Sales and Investment

To get an even deeper understanding of the profit impact of marketing strategy, we’ll now examine two measures of marketing efficiency—*marketing return on sales* (marketing ROS) and *marketing return on investment* (marketing ROI).ⁱᵛ

### Marketing return on sales  
(or marketing ROS)  
The percent of net sales attributable to the net marketing contribution—calculated by dividing net marketing contribution by net sales.

**Marketing return on sales** (or **marketing ROS**) shows the percent of net sales attributable to the net marketing contribution. For our product, ROS is:

$$
\text{Marketing ROS} = \frac{\text{net marketing contribution}}{\text{net sales}} = \frac{\$4,000,000}{\$100,000,000} = 0.04 = 4\%
$$

Thus, out of every $100 of sales, the product returns $4 to HD’s bottom line. A high marketing ROS is desirable. But to assess whether this is a good level of performance, HD must compare this figure to previous marketing ROS levels for the product, the ROSs of other products in the company’s portfolio, and the ROSs of competing products.

### Marketing return on investment  
(or marketing ROI)  
A measure of the marketing productivity of a marketing investment—calculated by dividing net marketing contribution by marketing expenses.

**Marketing return on investment** (or **marketing ROI**) measures the marketing productivity of a marketing investment. In HD’s case, the marketing investment is represented by $41 million of the total expenses. Thus, marketing ROI is:

$$
\text{Marketing ROI} = \frac{\text{net marketing contribution}}{\text{marketing expenses}} = \frac{\$4,000,000}{\$41,000,000} = 0.0976 = 9.76\%
$$

As with marketing ROS, a high value is desirable, but this figure should be compared with previous levels for the given product and with the marketing ROIs of competitors’ products. Note from this equation that marketing ROI could be greater than 100%. This can be achieved by attaining a higher net marketing contribution and/or a lower total marketing expense.

In this section, we estimated market potential and sales, developed profit-and-loss statements, and examined financial measures of performance. In the next section, we discuss methods for analyzing the impact of various marketing tactics. However, before moving on to those analyses, here’s another set of quantitative exercises to help you apply what you’ve learned to other situations.

# Marketing by the Numbers Exercise Set Two

**2.1** Determine the market potential for a product that has 20 million prospective buyers who purchase an average of 2 per year and price averages $50. How many units must a company sell if it desires a 10% share of this market?

**2.2** Develop a profit-and-loss statement for the Westgate division of North Industries. This division manufactures light fixtures sold to consumers through home-improvement and hardware stores. Cost of goods sold represents 40% of net sales. Marketing expenses include selling expenses, promotion expenses, and freight. Selling expenses include sales salaries totaling $3 million per year and sales commissions (5% of sales). The company spent $3 million on advertising last year, and freight costs were 10% of sales. Other costs include $2 million for managerial salaries and expenses for the marketing function and another $3 million for indirect overhead allocated to the division.  
a. Develop the profit-and-loss statement if net sales were $20 million last year.  
b. Develop the profit-and-loss statement if net sales were $40 million last year.  
c. Calculate Westgate’s break-even sales.

**2.3** Using the profit-and-loss statement you developed in question 2.2b, and assuming that Westgate’s beginning inventory was $11 million, ending inventory was $7 million, and total investment was $20 million including inventory, determine the following:  
a. gross margin percentage  
b. net profit percentage  
c. operating expense percentage  
d. inventory turnover rate  
e. return on investment (ROI)  
f. net marketing contribution  
g. marketing return on sales (marketing ROS)  
h. marketing return on investment (marketing ROI)  
i. Is the Westgate division doing well? Explain your answer.
