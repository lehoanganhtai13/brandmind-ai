They specialize in fresh produce and high-quality prepared foods—all at affordable prices. An example is Kroger’s Main & Vine stores, “where eating is healthy, affordable, and fun.”⁶ According to its online site, “Main & Vine is an awesome new market (really, it’s awesome!) where fresh food comes first and flavor brings people together. You’ll find groceries you can feel good about, friendly advice, and a whole lot more . . . right where you live, work and play.”

**Convenience stores** are small stores that carry a limited line of high-turnover convenience goods. After several years of stagnant sales, these stores are now experiencing growth. Many convenience store chains have tried to expand beyond their primary market of young, blue-collar men by redesigning their stores to attract female shoppers. They are shedding the image of a “truck stop” where men go to buy gas, beer, cigarettes, or shriveled hot dogs on a roller grill and are instead offering freshly prepared foods and cleaner, safer, more-upscale environments.

Many convenience stores are expanding their offerings to attract “fill-in” shoppers—people looking to pick up a few items between major grocery store trips. For example, in addition to supermarkets, Kroger operates almost 800 convenience stores. It is currently testing the fill-in concept in its Loaf ‘N Jug chain:⁷

> Loaf ‘N Jug convenience stores offer gas and an expanded selection of fresh produce, meats, frozen foods, and dairy items along with a wide variety of snacks, beverages, groceries, and other convenience products. They offer a range of healthier options as well, such as fresh fruit, salads, and nuts and dried fruit. Loaf ‘N Jug stores also carry Kroger’s affordable Simple Truth store brand of natural and organic foods. “We’re trying to provide that one-stop shop for the customer who’s looking for a place for that fill-in shop: fresh produce, meat, meal solutions, whether it be hot meal solutions or expanded grocery, expanded frozen,” says the president of Loaf ‘N Jug. “It’s the place where variety meets convenience.”

This table outlines different types of retail operations, categorized by their product assortment, size, and operational strategy. Convenience stores are characterized by their small size, proximity to residential areas, extended operating hours, and limited selection of high-turnover goods. In contrast, superstores are significantly larger, offering a broad range of both food and nonfood items, alongside services. Category killers are defined by their immense size and deep specialization within a particular product category. Service retailers, as their name suggests, primarily offer services rather than physical goods, with examples spanning hospitality, finance, and education. Finally, discount stores focus on selling standard merchandise at reduced prices, achieving profitability through high sales volume and lower profit margins. The overarching structure is a classification of retail formats based on distinct business models and offerings.

**Superstores** are much larger than regular supermarkets and offer a large assortment of routinely purchased food products, nonfood items, and services. Walmart, Target, Meijer, and other discount retailers offer *supercenters*, very large combination food and discount stores. Whereas a traditional grocery store brings in about $517,000 a week in sales, a supercenter brings in about $1.4 million a week.⁸

Recent years have also seen the rapid growth of superstores that are actually giant specialty stores, the so-called **category killers** (for example, Best Buy, Home Depot, Petco, and Bed Bath & Beyond). They feature stores the size of airplane hangars that carry a very deep assortment of a particular line. Category killers are found in a wide range of categories, including electronics, home-improvement products, books, baby gear, toys, home goods, party goods, sporting goods, and even pet supplies.

Finally, for many retailers, the product line is actually a service. **Service retailers** include hotels and motels, banks, airlines, restaurants, colleges, hospitals, movie theaters, tennis clubs, bowling alleys, repair services, hair salons, and dry cleaners. Service retailers in the United States are growing faster than product retailers.

## Relative Prices

Retailers can also be classified according to the prices they charge (see Table 13.1). Most retailers charge regular prices and offer normal-quality goods and customer service. Others offer higher-quality goods and service at higher prices. Retailers that feature low prices are discount stores and “off-price” retailers.

**Discount Stores.** A **discount store** (for example, Target, Kohl’s, or Walmart) sells standard merchandise at lower prices by accepting lower margins and selling higher volume.

The early discount stores cut expenses by offering few services and operating in warehouse-like facilities in low-rent, heavily traveled districts. Today’s discounters have improved their store environments and increased their services while at the same time keeping prices low through lean, efficient operations.

Leading “big-box” discounters, such as Walmart and Target, now dominate the retail scene. However, even “small-box” discounters are thriving in the current economic environment. One example is Leader Price, which has carved out a place as one of France’s leading discount stores against hypermarket “big box” discounters such as Carrefour. 🔵 Leader Price understands that French consumers seek value-oriented items, wish to spend responsibly, and demand that their retailers demonstrate their Leader Price, one of France’s leading “small box” discounters, competes with France’s “big box” discounters by offering low prices, high quality, and convenience.
