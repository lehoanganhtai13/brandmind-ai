# Market Offerings—Products, Services, and Experiences

Market offerings are not limited to physical *products*. They also include *services*—activities or benefits offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in the ownership of anything. Examples include banking, airline, hotel, retailing, and home repair services.

More broadly, market offerings also include other entities, such as *persons, places, organizations, information,* and *ideas*. For example, San Diego runs a “Happiness Is Calling” advertising campaign that invites visitors to come and enjoy the city’s great weather and good times—everything from its bays and beaches to its downtown nightlife and urban scenes. And the Ad Council and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration created a “Stop the Texts. Stop the Wrecks.” campaign that markets the idea of eliminating texting while driving. The campaign points out that a texting driver is 23 times more likely to get into a crash than a non-texting driver.⁶

Many sellers make the mistake of paying more attention to the specific products they offer than to the benefits and experiences produced by these products. These sellers suffer from **marketing myopia**. They are so taken with their products that they focus only on existing wants and lose sight of underlying customer needs.⁷ They forget that a product is only a tool to solve a consumer problem. A manufacturer of quarter-inch drill bits may think that the customer needs a drill bit. But what the customer *really* needs is a quarter-inch hole. These sellers will have trouble if a new product comes along that serves the customer’s need better or less expensively. The customer will have the same *need* but will *want* the new product.

Smart marketers look beyond the attributes of the products and services they sell. By orchestrating several services and products, they create *brand experiences* for consumers. For example, you don’t just visit Walt Disney World Resort; you immerse yourself and your family in a world of wonder, a world where dreams come true and things still work the way they should. And your local Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant doesn’t just serve up wings and beer; it gives customers the ultimate “Wings. Beer. Sports.” fan experience (see Real Marketing 1.1).

Similarly, Mattel’s American Girl does much more than just make and sell high-end dolls. It creates special experiences between the dolls and the girls who adore them.⁸

> To put more smiles on the faces of the girls who love their American Girl dolls, the company operates huge American Girl experiential stores in 20 major cities around the country. Each store carries an amazing selection of dolls plus every imaginable outfit and accessory. But more than just places to shop, American Girl stores are exciting destinations unto themselves, offering wonderfully engaging experiences for girls, mothers, grandmothers, and even dads or grandpas. There’s an in-store restaurant where girls, their dolls, and grown-ups can sit down together for brunch, lunch, afternoon tea, or dinner. There’s even a doll hair salon where a stylist can give a doll a new hairdo. American Girl also offers “perfect parties” to celebrate a birthday or any day as well as a full slate of special events, from crafts and activities to excursions. Much more than a store that sells dolls, says the company, “it’s the place where imaginations can soar.” A visit to American Girl creates “Fun today. Memories forever.”

## Customer Value and Satisfaction

Consumers usually face a broad array of products and services that might satisfy a given need. How do they choose among these many market offerings? Customers form expectations about the value and satisfaction that various market offerings will deliver and buy accordingly. Satisfied customers buy again and tell others about their good experiences. Dissatisfied customers often switch to competitors and disparage the product to others.

Marketers must be careful to set the right level of expectations. If they set expectations too low, they may satisfy those who buy but fail to attract enough buyers. If they set expectations too high, buyers will be disappointed. Customer value and customer satisfaction are key building blocks for developing and managing customer relationships. We will revisit these core concepts later in the chapter.
