## Actors in the Microenvironment

This diagram illustrates the microenvironment of a company's marketing efforts, depicting key external actors that influence its ability to serve customers. At the center is **The company**, which interacts with various external entities. Directly surrounding the company are **Marketing intermediaries**, who assist the company in promoting, selling, and distributing its products. Also closely linked are **Suppliers**, providing resources for the company's operations. Further out, the diagram shows **Competitors**, who offer similar products or services to the same customers. Crucially, **Customers** are presented as the ultimate focus, both as a direct external group and implicitly through the actions of intermediaries and competitors. Finally, **Publics**, representing various groups with an interest in the company's activities, are also identified as external influences. The structure is largely concentric, radiating outward from the company to its immediate marketing environment and then to broader external forces.

> In creating value for customers, marketers must partner with other firms in the company’s value delivery network.

> Marketers must work in harmony with other company departments to create customer value and relationships.

> Customers are the most important actors in the company’s microenvironment. The aim of the entire value delivery system is to serve target customers and create strong relationships with them.

## The Company

In designing marketing plans, marketing management takes other company groups into account—groups such as top management, finance, research and development (R&D), purchasing, operations, human resources, and accounting. All of these interrelated groups form the internal environment. Top management sets the company’s mission, objectives, broad strategies, and policies. Marketing managers make decisions within these broader strategies and plans. Then, as we discussed in Chapter 2, marketing managers must work closely with other company departments. With marketing taking the lead, all departments—from manufacturing and finance to legal and human resources—share the responsibility for understanding customer needs and creating customer value.

## Suppliers

Suppliers form an important link in the company’s overall customer value delivery network. They provide the resources needed by the company to produce its goods and services. Supplier problems can seriously affect marketing. Marketing managers must watch supply availability and costs. Supply shortages or delays, natural disasters, and other events can cost sales in the short run and damage customer satisfaction in the long run. Rising supply costs may force price increases that can harm the company’s sales volume.

Most marketers today treat their suppliers as partners in creating and delivering customer value. Morrison’s, one of the United Kingdom’s leading supermarkets, sells a large number of items, including seafood, dairy products, meat, bakery goods, and non-food grocery products. It has realized that the significance of its relationship with suppliers cannot be understated if it is to succeed in the competitive retail sector. It acknowledges that the various awards it has achieved over the years—including “Supermarket of the Year,” “Nations’ Best Café,” and “Most Sustainable Retailer of the Year”—could not have been achieved without good relations with its suppliers. Its endeavor to maintain good relationships with suppliers shows in many ways. For instance, Morrison’s premium brand of milk costs 10 pence per liter more than the Morrison’s standard price, and according to Martyn Jones, the corporate services director of the organization, the supermarket uses this to support the dairy farmers who supply the milk. Morrison’s also encourages farmers to complete the Grocery Code Adjudicator’s annual supplier survey, through which the relationship could be developed further. In fact, the close relationship between Morrison’s and its suppliers has also culminated in a different way; the organization hired its former supplier, Neil Davison of Express Dairies, to work for it.
