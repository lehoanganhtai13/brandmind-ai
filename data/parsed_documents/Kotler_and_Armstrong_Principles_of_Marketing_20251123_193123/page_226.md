AGING GRACEFULLY  
One of London’s finest cheese shops, La Fromagerie, isn’t far from the St. Pancras Renaissance. You haven’t lived until you’ve tried their 24-month aged Mimolette Vieille with a proper British ale. I’ll have one waiting for you at the bar.

Renaissance Hotels’ Navigator program puts a personal and local face on each location by “micro-localizing” recommendations for guests’ food, shopping, entertainment, and cultural experiences at each destination. The program is anchored by on-site Renaissance Hotels “Navigators” at each location. Whether it’s Omar Bennett, a restaurant-loving Brooklynite at the Renaissance New York Times Square Hotel, or James Elliott at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, a history buff and local pub expert, Navigators are extensively trained locals who are deeply passionate about the destination and often have a personal connection to the locale.  

● Based on 100-plus hours of intense training plus their own personal experiences and ongoing research, they work with guests personally to help them experience “the hidden gems throughout the neighborhood of each hotel through the eyes of those who know it best.”

In addition, Renaissance Hotels engages locals in each city to participate by inviting them to follow their local Navigator via social media as well as adding their own favorites to the system, creating each hotel’s own version of Yelp. Navigators then cull through submitted tips and feature the best recommendations alongside their own for sharing within the hotel lobby or on its web, mobile, and social media channels. Since introducing the hyper-localized Navigator program as part of Renaissance Hotels’ “Live Life to Discover” campaign two years ago, the hotel’s website traffic has grown more than 80 percent, Facebook Likes have exploded from 40,000 to more than 900,000, and Twitter followers have surged from 5,000 to 110,000.

Advances in communications technology have given rise to new high-tech versions of location-based marketing. Thanks to the explosion in smartphones and tablets that integrate geolocation technology, companies can now track consumers’ whereabouts closely and engage them on the go with localized deals and information fast, wherever they may be. It’s called *SoLoMo* (*social+local+mobile*) marketing. Services such as Foursquare and Shopkick and retailers ranging from REI and Starbucks to Walgreens and Macy’s have jumped onto the SoLoMo bandwagon, primarily in the form of smartphone and tablet apps. Mobile app Shopkick excels at SoLoMo:  

> Shopkick sends special offers and rewards to shoppers simply for checking into client stores such as Target, Macy’s, Best Buy, Old Navy, or Crate & Barrel and buying brands from Shopkick partners such as P&G, Unilever, Disney, Kraft, and L’Oréal. When shoppers are near a participating store, the Shopkick app on their phone picks up a signal from the store and spits out store coupons, deal alerts, and product information. When Shopkickers walk into their favorite retail stores, the app automatically checks them in and they rack up rewards points or “kicks.” If they buy something or scan product bar codes, they get even more kicks. Users can use their kicks for discounted or free merchandise of their own choosing. Shopkick helps users get the most out of their efforts by mapping out potential kicks in a given geographic area. Shopkick has grown quickly to become one of the nation’s top shopping apps, with more 15 million users and 300 brand partners.

Local marketing has some drawbacks, however. It can drive up manufacturing and marketing costs by reducing the economies of scale. It can also create logistics problems as companies try to meet the varied requirements of different local markets. Still, as companies face increasingly fragmented markets and as new supporting digital technologies develop, the advantages of local marketing often outweigh the drawbacks.
