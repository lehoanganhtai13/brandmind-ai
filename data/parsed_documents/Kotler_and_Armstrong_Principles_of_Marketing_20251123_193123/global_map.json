Therefore, they must identify the parts of the market they can serve best and most profitably. The chapter breaks down the process into four major steps: Market Segmentation (dividing a market into smaller segments), Market Targeting (evaluating and selecting target segments), Differentiation (differentiating the firm’s market offering to create superior customer value), and Positioning (arranging for a market offering to occupy a clear, distinctive, and desirable place relative to competing products in the minds of target consumers).
