# The Role and Impact of PR

However, public relations can have a strong impact at a much lower cost than advertising can. Interesting brand stories, events, videos, or other content can be picked up by different media or shared virally by consumers, giving it the same or even greater impact than advertising that would cost millions of dollars. Consider recent PR moves by Burger King:[^30]

Last year’s Floyd Mayweather–Manny Pacquiao fight in Las Vegas was a commercial-free pay-per-view event. Blue circle icon So when “The King”—Burger King’s quirky, ceramic-headed robed mascot—appeared as part of Mayweather’s entourage during the walkout prior the “Fight of the Century,” it caused quite a stir. Beyond the 4.4 million viewers who watch the fight live worldwide, The King’s appearance was all over Facebook and Twitter, generating big-time buzz for the burger chain. Burger King paid Mayweather an estimated $1 million, but that was a small fraction of the $5 million companies spend for a single 30-second Super Bowl ad. A month later, the bearded mascot popped up at the Belmont Stakes in an owner’s box behind trainer Bob Baffert, whose horse American Pharoah ran for the coveted Triple Crown that day. As TV cameras panned Baffert before the race, The King stole the show, once again sparking a social media frenzy. The Belmont appearance reportedly cost Burger King only a $200,000 donation to a racing-related charity.

In yet another clever PR move, Burger King recently issued an invitation to rival McDonald’s to call a cease-fire on Peace Day. In a full slate of online content, as well as full-page ads in *The New York Times* and the *Chicago Tribune*, Burger King publicly proposed that the chains jointly develop and sell a McWhopper, containing “all the tastiest bits of your Big Mac and our Whopper, united in one delicious, peace-loving burger,” with all the proceeds benefiting the Peace One Day organization. McDonald’s refused, but the gesture generated hugely positive PR for Burger King. Through these and other PR moves, Burger King has found a way to inject itself into daily social media conversations. “Burger King has really found a way to get attention by doing the unexpected and somewhat irreverent,” says one expert. “They’re generating an enormous amount of publicity at a very modest cost.” Says another expert, “If you have the right spark, it will generate more buzz than paid media.”

Despite its potential strengths, public relations is occasionally described as a marketing stepchild.
