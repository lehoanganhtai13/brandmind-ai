# 2 Company and Marketing Strategy  
## Partnering to Build Customer Engagement, Value, and Relationships

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

In the first chapter, we explored the marketing process by which companies create value for customers to capture value from them in return. In this chapter, we dig deeper into steps two and three of that process: designing customer value–driven marketing strategies and constructing marketing programs. First, we look at the organization’s overall strategic planning, which guides marketing strategy and planning. Next, we discuss how, guided by the strategic plan, marketers partner closely with others inside and outside the firm to engage customers and create value for them. We then examine marketing strategy and planning—how marketers choose target markets, position their market offerings, develop a marketing mix, and manage their marketing programs. Finally, we look at the important step of measuring and managing marketing return on investment (marketing ROI).

First, let’s look at Rolex, an outstanding company and a good marketing strategy story. Rolex met with enormous instant success by focusing on the customer and on product features that are important to them. The company has pursued this customer-driven marketing strategy since its foundation. Along the way, it discovered that good marketing strategy means more than just growth, sales, and profits. It means skillfully engaging customers and creating value for them. At its core, Rolex doesn’t sell just wristwatches; it sells a sentiment of achievement and of belonging to an exclusive club.

## ROLEX: Building Brand Equity through a Customer-Driven Marketing Mix

In 1905, in London, Alfred Davis and his brother-in-law Hans Wilsdorf founded Wilsdorf and Davis, the company that would eventually become Rolex SA. Rolex is the single largest luxury watch brand, with estimated 2014 revenues of $4.6 billion. Although its luxury wrist watches are manufactured in Switzerland, the company maintains a network of 4,000 Rolex-trained watchmakers in over 100 countries. Rolex has set up and maintained its pole position in the luxury watch market through its customer value–driven marketing strategy and by focusing on features that have been important to its customer base since the company was founded.

Product-wise, Rolex has the distinction of having many new-to-the-world products launched due to its research and development as well as manufacture of unique and timeless watches. In 1910, a Rolex watch was the first wristwatch in the world to receive the Swiss Certificate of Precision, granted by the Official Watch Rating Centre, and in 1914, the Kew Observatory in Great Britain awarded a Rolex wristwatch a class A precision certificate, which until that point had been reserved exclusively for marine chronometers. Rolex watches became synonymous with precision all over the world. In 1926, the company took a major step toward developing the world’s first waterproof wristwatch, named the “Oyster.” The following year, the watch was worn by Mercedes Gleitze, a young Englishwoman who swam the English Channel. The watch remained in perfect working order after the 10-hour swim, and this event prompted Rolex to use testimonials in their advertising strategy to convey the superiority of the brand. Since then, the Oyster has graced the wrists of personages from Winston Churchill to Che Guevara to Eminem. Launched in 1953, the “Submariner” was the first watch guaranteed to be waterproof to a depth of 100 meters. In the same year, the expedition led by Sir Edmund Hillary was equipped with the “Oyster Perpetual,” and his team became the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest. All of this has made Rolex watches synonymous with precision, achievement, robustness, and reliability. The design of its products went through such minor changes that they are recognizable at first sight, setting the brand apart from its rivals. It has become an outward expression of exclusiveness and of the
