# Engaging Consumers and Communicating Customer Value

“If we talk to our salespeople in our 140 markets all over the world,” said Anders Vilhelmsson, PR director for Volvo Trucks, “they tell us very often one of the first things prospective customers bring up in conversation is the viral film.”

With all this success achieved on a shoestring budget, it’s no surprise that Volvo Trucks extended the “Live Tests” campaign. Following the same model set by the first six videos, the team produced some unlikely pieces, including a race between a Volvo tractor and a supercar as well as a hidden-camera exposé showing the reaction of a valet as a Volvo truck pulls up in front of a black-tie casino. But the most recent video became one of the most successful entries of the campaign to date. “Look Who’s Driving” puts a darling British four-year-old behind the remote controls of the Volvo FMX—a dump truck that the ad proclaims is “the toughest truck we ever built.”

Rather than just a clever series of stunts for the sake of stunts, “Live Tests” pulled off a monumental task. By selecting features with high relevance to both its new models and the target audience, Volvo communicated those features through stories that captivated viewers everywhere. The campaign achieved the goal of successfully launching five new trucks, with phase two ultimately producing a social media fan base double the size of the one Volvo Trucks had achieved following the first phase of the campaign. The campaign has also helped Volvo Trucks to achieve record sales and market share worldwide. Even more amazing, Volvo Trucks did all that on a shoestring budget. In the world of integrated marketing communications, “Live Tests” is truly an epic.
