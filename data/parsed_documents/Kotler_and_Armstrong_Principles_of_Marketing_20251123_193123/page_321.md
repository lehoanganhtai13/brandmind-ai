Its same-store sales and profits have flattened, and its stock price has dipped.

Thus, at Whole Food Market, finding and marketing the right price-value equation is still a work in progress. On the value side, the company’s latest marketing campaign—called *Values Matter*—emphasizes that “value” is inseparable from “values.” When shopping at Whole Foods, customers can be confident about “where their food comes from and how it was grown, raised, or made.” The retailer’s produce is “responsibly grown.” The campaign concludes: “Whole Foods Market: America’s healthiest grocery store,” underscoring the extra value that makes shopping at Whole Foods Market worth the premium prices it charges.

At the same time that it’s maintaining a high-end value proposition in its main stores, however, Whole Foods Market is also looking for growth by wooing a new segment of thriftier young consumers. It recently launched a new subchain—called *365 by Whole Foods Market*—that targets less affluent but value-savvy, tech-minded millennials. 365 by Whole Foods Market stores are designed to bring “fresh, healthy foods to a broader audience with a streamlined, quality-meets-value shopping experience.” The new stores carry Whole Foods’ own 365-branded products plus a carefully selected mix of other goods at prices that look more like Trader Joe’s than Whole Foods. “We think there are certain customers that the Whole Foods brand is attractive to, but there’re others that it’s less attractive to,” says the Whole Foods CEO. “We think a streamlined, hip, cool, technology-oriented store—a store unlike one anyone’s ever seen before . . . is going to be pretty attractive to that particular generation.”

Whole Foods Market’s pricing struggles underscore the difficulty many firms face in finding the best balance between price and value. Whole Foods’ challenge is to meet the changing demands of today’s intensely competitive pricing environment in a way that preserves what has made it special to customers through the years. In all, things aren’t really much different inside a local Whole Foods Market these days. There are more sale items, and the private-label 365 Everyday Value brand is more prominently presented, but customers can still find the same alluring assortment of high-quality, flavorful, and natural foods wrapped in Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet values.

But it’s a delicate balance. “We have the ability to compete on price and we will do that,” says the CEO. “But this is not just a race to the bottom. We are also going to start a new race to the top, with better-quality food, higher standards, richer experiences for our customers, and new levels of transparency and accountability in the marketplace.” Even if that means charging a little higher prices.

Companies often position their products on price and then tailor other marketing mix decisions to the prices they want to charge. Here, price is a crucial product-positioning factor that defines the product’s market, competition, and design. Many firms support such price-positioning strategies with a technique called **target costing**. Target costing reverses the usual process of first designing a new product, determining its cost, and then asking, “Can we sell it for that?” Instead, it starts with an ideal selling price based on customer value considerations and then targets costs that will ensure that the price is met. For example, when Honda initially designed the Honda Fit, it began with a $13,950 starting price point and highway mileage of 33 miles per gallon firmly in mind. It then designed a stylish, peppy little car with costs that allowed it to give target customers those values.

Other companies deemphasize price and use other marketing mix tools to create *non-price* positions. Often, the best strategy is not to charge the lowest price but rather to differentiate the marketing offer to make it worth a higher price. For example, Sleep Number puts high value into its mattresses and charges a higher price to match that value.

At the most basic level, a Sleep Number mattress lets you adjust each side to your ideal level of firmness and support. Add SleepIQ technology and you can track and optimize for the best possible night’s sleep. ● Sleep Number lets you “Know. Adjust. Sleep.” SleepIQ technology inside the bed monitors restful sleep time, heart rate, breathing rate, movements, and other factors. Then the SleepIQ app reports on your night’s SleepIQ score and how you slept. The app even recommends adjustments that will change your sleep for the better. The Sleep Number children’s mattress line helps parents track how their kids sleep. It even lets parents know when their kids get out of bed at night and includes a head tilt for stuffy heads, star-based rewards for sleep habits, and a clever “monster detector.” Sleep Number beds cost more than traditional mattresses—models run from $1,000 to more than $7,000 compared with good-quality traditional mattresses at $1,000 or less. But Sleep Number’s satisfied Sleep Number beds cost more than traditional mattresses, but the brand’s highly satisfied customers are willing to pay more to get more.
