Singles look for social spaces (bars and cafes) and group activities.

MSC Cruises tends to focus on the family market segment for shorter cruises and the seniors market segment for longer cruises. And coming from an Italian heritage, they are quite “Mediterranean-inspired,” providing more basic on-board facilities rather than water slides and rock climbing. In order to attract family groups, they offer “children travel free” packages along with kids’ clubs and a family games room.

## Cruise Pricing Considerations

While the operating profit margin for each cruise line will vary, the average margin in the industry is around 10 percent. As the overall industry revenue is now approaching $40 billion, this means that the total industry net income is around $4 billion.

Again, on average, cruise lines only generate around 70–75 percent of their total revenue from passenger ticket sales. The remaining revenue is generated from the sale of beverages, excursions and tours, shop sales, casino gaming, Internet access, laundry services, spa and beauty services, photos, and premium dining and alcohol.

As in airline pricing, each cabin on a cruise ship represents inventory to be sold. Due to the high fixed-cost structure and the relatively low cost of an extra occupied cabin, it is in the cruise line’s interest to sell as many cabins as possible (much in the same way that airlines seek to sell as many seats at the best possible price).

And like most holiday industries, cruising has seasonal demand, with demand higher in the warmer months. Consumers also use a mix of buying approaches, from early planners (who are generally more price-sensitive), to people looking for the “right holiday” (and are less price-sensitive), to last-minute deal hunters.

This mix of consumer behavior means that cruise pricing needs to be dynamic. Therefore, for popular high-season cruises, the prices can be increased. But for low-season or poorly booked cruises, special deals need to be offered. One way of doing this effectively (without offering low prices to the entire market) is to offer special deals in certain countries or through selected travel agencies.

## The Case for Cost-Based Pricing

Cruise operators typically have a high fixed-cost structure. First there is the significant cost of the ship’s depreciation. As the industry is moving towards larger ships with more facilities, the cost of these newer ships are usually in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, and they are also likely to need major refurbishments in future years in order to maintain up-to-date.

Depending on the financial structure of the cruise company involved, another major fixed cost is the interest expense associated with each ship’s capital cost. As MSC is a privately owned company, they do not have access to public equity funds and are more likely to rely on borrowing and profit reinvestment to help expand their fleet. The final major fixed cost is the ongoing maintenance and running costs of the ships.

One of their major variable costs is wages. Large cruise ships usually have over 1,000 staff on board. With around 75 percent of staff members involved in passenger-contact roles such as in restaurants, bars, shops, and entertainment, it is difficult to reduce staff numbers without negatively impacting customer service levels. Fortunately for the cruise lines, they are generally able to keep staff costs down by offsetting wages against the staff’s food and accommodation on board.

Other significant variable costs include fuel costs, port charges, and food and beverage. While these variable costs would be quite substantial, their very high fixed-cost structure is likely to be far more significant given their overall capital investment. This highlights the importance of cost recovery when setting prices for a cruise.

## The Case for Competitor-Based Pricing

The Internet has transformed how consumers make decisions, and this is also true of the travel industry. When deciding on a holiday, consumers are no longer reliant on travel agents and instead use review websites such as TripAdvisor to help guide their decisions. They have a greater affinity for shopping around and comparing deals, making them more price sensitive than ever before.

A first-time cruising consumer is likely to have no real brand loyalty and perhaps even perceive that all cruise lines are “generally the same.” This may mean that cruise operators offering similar cruises may be primarily assessed on the basis of price.

And not only are cruises competing against other cruise offers, but consumers are also likely to assess their potential holiday choice against indirect competitors such as traditional flight and resort destinations (which are often packaged together as one deal).

## The Case for Customer Value-Based Pricing

The third pricing strategy discussed in the chapter is setting prices based upon the perception of value. Since the reinvention of the industry, cruises have tried to position themselves as the destination itself, providing the unique ability to transport customers through multiple countries within the comfort of a floating “hotel” room.

Cruises usually offer a completely packaged experience, including accommodation, food, entertainment, shopping, casinos, spas, fitness centers, activities, kid’s clubs, and the opportunity to meet new people. This overall package of benefits means that the entire holiday is organized, usually with something for everyone, regardless of age or interests. Obviously, this all-in-one holiday solution would represent significant value for many consumers.

## MSC Cruise’s Approach to Pricing

Like most other cruise lines, MSC works hard at making the upfront cost of the cruise appear attractive while trying to maximize their other revenue streams in order to be profitable.

They usually promote their cruises using a headline price in their advertising based upon their interior cabins (the lowest-priced cabins). As the consumer moves through the booking process, they are offered improved cabin types and improved service packages in order to up-sell the customer to a higher price point. There may be up to 20 different cabin categories, depending on deck, cabin size, view, and whether they are interior or exterior and mid- or end-ship.

This is a similar approach to most other “mass-market” cruise lines (but not the high-end luxury cruises that are less price-sensitive). This creates quite a competitive, and somewhat confusing, set of prices across the various cruise offerings.

In addition to the accommodation cost of the cruise, while most meals are included, there is an additional charge for some specialty menu items. Beverages also attract an additional MSC has plans to introduce one new cruise ship per year (on average) up until 2025, when they expect to surpass Norwegian Cruise Lines to become the world’s third-largest cruise operator.
