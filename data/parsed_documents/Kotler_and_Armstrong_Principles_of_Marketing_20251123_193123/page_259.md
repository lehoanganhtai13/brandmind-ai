# Services Marketing

> **Author Comment**  
> As noted at the start of this chapter, services are “products,” too—intangible ones. So all the product topics we’ve discussed so far apply to services as well as to physical products. However, in this section, we focus on the special characteristics and marketing needs that set services apart.

Services have grown dramatically in recent years. Services now account for almost 80 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Services are growing even faster in the world economy, making up almost 63 percent of the gross world product.  
Service industries vary greatly. *Governments* offer services through courts, employment services, hospitals, military services, police and fire departments, the postal service, and schools. *Private not-for-profit organizations* offer services through museums, charities, churches, colleges, foundations, and hospitals. In addition, a large number of *business organizations* offer services—airlines, banks, hotels, insurance companies, consulting firms, medical and legal practices, entertainment and telecommunications companies, real estate firms, retailers, and others.

## The Nature and Characteristics of a Service

A company must consider four special service characteristics when designing marketing programs: intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability (see **Figure 8.3**).

> **Service intangibility**  
> Services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before they are bought.

Service **intangibility** means that services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before they are bought. For example, people undergoing cosmetic surgery cannot see the result before the purchase. Airline passengers have nothing but a ticket and a promise that they and their luggage will arrive safely at the intended destination, hopefully at the same time. To reduce uncertainty, buyers look for *signals* of service quality. They draw conclusions about quality from the place, people, price, equipment, and communications that they can see.

Therefore, the service provider’s task is to make the service tangible in one or more ways and send the right signals about quality. The Mayo Clinic does this well:

> When it comes to hospitals, most patients can’t really judge “product quality.” It’s a very complex product that’s hard to understand, and you can’t try it out before buying it. So when considering a hospital, most people unconsciously search for evidence that the facility is caring, competent, and trustworthy. The Mayo Clinic doesn’t leave these things to chance. Rather, it offers patients organized and honest evidence of its dedication to “providing the best care to every patient every day.”  
> Inside, staff is trained to act in a way that clearly signals Mayo Clinic’s concern for patient well-being. For example, doctors regularly follow up with patients at home to see how they are doing, and they work with patients to smooth out scheduling problems. The clinic’s physical facilities also send the right signals. They’ve been carefully designed to offer a place of refuge, show caring and respect, and signal competence. Looking for external confirmation? Go online and hear directly from those who’ve been to the clinic or work there. The Mayo Clinic uses social networking—everything from blogs to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest—to enhance the patient experience. For example, on the Sharing Mayo Clinic blog (http://sharing.mayoclinic.org), patients and their families retell their Mayo experiences, and Mayo employees offer behind-the-scenes views. The result? Highly loyal customers who willingly spread the good word to others, building one of the most powerful brands in health care.

### Figure 8.3  
#### Four Service Characteristics

This table outlines the four key characteristics of services: intangibility, inseparability, variability, and perishability. Intangibility signifies that services cannot be experienced through the senses prior to consumption. Inseparability highlights that services are produced and consumed simultaneously, making them inseparable from their providers. Variability indicates that the quality of a service can differ significantly depending on the provider, time, location, and circumstances of its delivery. Finally, perishability means that services cannot be stored for future use or sale, as they are consumed at the moment of production. These characteristics collectively differentiate services from tangible goods and influence their marketing and management strategies.

> Although services are “products” in a general sense, they have special characteristics and marketing needs. The biggest differences come from the fact that services are essentially intangible and that they are created through direct interactions with customers. Think about your experiences with an airline or Google versus Nike or Apple.
