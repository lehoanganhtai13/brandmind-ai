The fragmentation of this category, combined with domination by the market leaders, has created a severely competitive environment. Although there is indirect competition posed by all types of bottled waters and even other types of beverages (soft drinks, energy drinks, juices, teas, and flavor drops), this competitive analysis focuses on direct competition from leading functional water brands. Functional water brands are either sweetened and flavored, just flavored, or neither sweetened nor flavored. Sweetened varieties blend traditional sugars with zero-calorie sweeteners. The types of sweeteners used create a point of differentiation. The result is a range of sugar content, carbohydrates, and calories as high as half that of regular soft drinks and other sweetened beverages and as low as zero.

Pricing for this product is consistent across brands and varies by type of retail outlet, with convenience stores typically charging more than grocery stores. The price for a 20-ounce bottle ranges from $1.00 to $1.89, with some niche brands costing slightly more. While Smartwater is the leading functional water brand, it is a plain still water enhanced with electrolytes. Chill Beverage’s NutriWater will focus on competition posed by flavored and enhanced water brands, include the following:

* *Vitaminwater:* Created in 2000 as a new product for Energy Brands’ Glacéau, which was also the developer of Smartwater (distilled water with electrolytes). Coca-Cola purchased Energy Brands for $4.1 billion in 2007. Vitaminwater is sold in regular and zero-calorie versions. With 18 bottled varieties—9 regular and 9 zero-calorie—as well as availability in fountain form and drops, Vitaminwater offers more options than any brand on the market. Whereas Vitaminwater varieties are distinguished by flavor, they are named to invoke perceptions of benefits such as Refresh, Power-C, Focus, and Revive. The brand’s current slogan is “Hydrate the Hustle.” Vitaminwater is vapor distilled, de-ionized, and/or filtered and is sweetened with crystalline fructose (corn syrup) and cane sugar or erythritol and stevia. Vitaminwater exceeds $700 million in annual sales and commands 34 percent of the functional water market.

* *Propel:* Gatorade created Propel in 2000, just one year prior to PepsiCo’s purchase of this leading sports drink marketer. Marketed as “The Workout Water,” Propel was originally available in regular and zero-calorie varieties. However, it is now available only as a zero-calorie beverage. Propel comes in 10 varieties, each containing the same blend of B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, antioxidants, and electrolytes. It is sweetened with sucralose. Propel is available in a wide variety of sizes, with 16.9-, 20-, and 24-ounce PET bottles and multipacks. Propel is also marketed in powder form and as a liquid enhancer to be added to bottled water. With $183 million in revenues, Propel is the number-three functional water brand with approximately 9 percent of the functional water market.

* *SoBe Lifewater:* PepsiCo bought SoBe in 2000. SoBe introduced Lifewater in 2008 with a hit Super Bowl ad as an answer to Coca-Cola’s Vitaminwater. The Lifewater line includes six zero-calorie varieties. Each variety is infused with a formulation of vitamins, minerals, and herbs designed to provide a claimed benefit. Sweetened with Stevia-based PureVia, Lifewater makes the claim to be “all natural.” It contains no artificial flavors or colors. Lifewater is sold in 20-ounce PET bottles and multipacks. With $144 million in annual revenues, Lifewater is the fourth-largest functional water brand with a 7 percent share.

* *Niche brands:* The market for functional waters includes companies that market their wares on a small scale through independent retailers: Assure, Ex Aqua Vitamins, Ayala Herbal Water, and Skinny Water. Some brands feature exotic additives and/or artistic glass bottles.

Despite the strong competition, NutriWater believes it can create a relevant brand image and gain recognition among the targeted segments. The brand offers strong points of differentiation with higher and unique vitamin content, all-natural ingredients, and support for a relevant social cause. With other strategic assets, Chill Beverage is confident that it can establish a competitive advantage that will allow NutriWater to grow in the market.

## Channels and Logistics Review

With the three main brands now owned by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, there is a huge hole in the independent distributor system. NutriWater will be distributed through an independent distributor to a network of retailers in the United States. This strategy will avoid some of the head-on competition for shelf space with the Coca-Cola and PepsiCo brands and will also directly target likely NutriWater customers. As with the rollout of the core Chill Soda Brand, this strategy will focus on placing coolers in retail locations that will exclusively hold NutriWater.
