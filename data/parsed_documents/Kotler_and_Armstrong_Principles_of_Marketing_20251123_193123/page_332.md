# Pricing Strategies: Additional Considerations

One of the best illustrations of Apple’s premium pricing power is the Apple Watch. Apple was hardly a pioneer in introducing its smartwatch. Dozens of companies were already selling wearables across a broad range of price points. In the year prior to the launch of the Apple Watch, competitors sold 6.8 million smartwatches at an average price of $189. Apple unveiled its own smartwatch in three versions. The least expensive version, the basic Apple Watch Sport, sold for $349, nearly twice the average industry price. At the other extreme was the ultra-premium Apple Watch Edition, made of solid 18-karat gold with sapphire crystal glass. Fully loaded, it sold for as much as $17,000. Such high prices did anything but scare away buyers. By one estimate, Apple will sell an estimated 21 million Apple Watches a year and now holds a 74 percent share of the greatly expanded smartwatch market.

More broadly, Apple’s ability to command higher prices and margins has produced stunning sales and profit results. In smartphones, for example, Apple captures an impressive 20 percent share of total global sales. However, it commands an even more impressive 50 percent share of the premium smartphone segment. Most remarkably, thanks to its premium prices, Apple routinely pulls in a lion’s share of industry profits. For instance, in one recent quarter, it grabbed a dazzling 92 percent of the total smartphone profits made by the world’s top eight smartphone makers. Similarly, Apple captures nearly 50 percent of the profits in the competitively crowded personal computer market.

Overall, in just the past four years, Apple’s sales have more than doubled to a record $234 billion, placing the company at number five on the list of Fortune 500 companies, ahead of traditional industrial giants such as GM and GE. Brand tracker Interbrand recently rated Apple as the world’s most valuable brand. And the company’s soaring stock prices have made Apple one of the world’s two most valuable companies, neck and neck with Google parent Alphabet.

Even with all this success, however, Apple’s premium pricing strategy does present some risks. For example, in some markets—especially the world’s rapidly growing emerging markets—Apple’s high prices make it vulnerable to low-price competitors. Consider China, which accounts for a full one-third of all smartphone sales worldwide. In China, Apple now places third in market share behind fast-growing, low-priced local competitors such Xiaomi and Huawei.

Chinese market leader Xiaomi has come from nowhere in just the past three years to become the world’s third-largest smartphone producer behind only Apple and Samsung. It produces low-cost smartphones, laptops, and other devices that are modeled closely after Apple devices. It even has a thriving iTunes clone that supplies apps, games, and other content. Xiaomi packs potent technology and stunning design into dirt-cheap phones that sell at a fraction of Apple’s prices. For instance, an entry-level iPhone sells in China for $833—that’s more than a month’s wages for the average Chinese buyer. By contrast, the average Xiaomi smartphone goes for only $149.

With its smart design and low, low prices, Xiaomi is targeting the “technically inclined, geeky, typically younger sort of customer who can’t afford a top-of-the-line Apple or Samsung phone,” says one tech blogger. Such consumers make up the fastest-rising tech segment not just in China but also in other emerging markets such as India and Brazil. And so far, Apple neither has—nor intends to have—an affordable answer for that type of consumer. Low-end products simply don’t fit Apple’s operating style or premium positioning.

However, Apple is still thriving in China and other emerging economies by catering to the also-burgeoning numbers of more-affluent consumers in those markets who want and can afford the luxury and status associated with Apple. Just like anywhere else, if you can afford it, an Apple device is well worth the premium price. In China, according to one analyst, “It’s a price people have been willing to pay, specifically because it is expensive.” For instance, remember that exorbitantly priced Apple Watch Edition? It sold out in China in less than an hour.

Thus, whether here or abroad, Apple’s premium pricing strategy will likely remain a winner. “The dominance of Apple is something that is very hard to overcome,” says an industry executive. “Apple has to stumble somehow or another, and I don’t think that’s going to happen.” The lesson is simple: Truly premium products earn premium prices.
