In many respects, Salesforce’s own sales force serves as a model for the products and services it sells—not just for using the Salesforce cloud but more generally for achieving the “supercharged” sales force results that the company promises its clients.

At Salesforce, developing an outstanding sales force starts with recruiting and hiring top-notch salespeople. Salesforce’s aggressive but highly selective recruiting program skims the cream off the top of the global sales rep candidate pool. Each year on average, Salesforce hires only 4.5 percent of the more than 100,000 candidates who applied. Experience counts. Salesforce expects a minimum of two years of prior sales experience for small-business sales reps and up to two decades of experience for sales execs assigned to major accounts. To find such experienced candidates, Salesforce freely raids rival companies for new hires, counting on its high-energy culture and strong compensation packages to lure successful salespeople into the Salesforce fold.

Once hired, as you might expect, Salesforce salespeople have access to all the latest high-tech selling tools. In fact, the first major assignment of new hires is to study 20 hours of at-home video that teaches them the ins and outs of the Salesforce technologies that they won’t be just selling but also using. But Salesforce would be the first to tell you that, although its cloud wizardry can help to optimize customer contact and the selling process, it doesn’t take the place of good personal selling skills. So in training and fine-tuning its own sales force, the company starts by preaching tried-and-true selling fundamentals, tempered by its own modern twists.

The first fundamental of good selling at Salesforce is to *listen and learn*. As new recruits go through Salesforce’s weeklong selling boot camp, taught at the company’s Salesforce U, they learn that they should begin building customer relationships by asking probing questions and getting customers to talk, seeking to understand everything they can about a customer’s situation and needs. “Eighty-five percent of salespeople don’t slow down enough to really understand their customer’s business,” says a senior Salesforce sales executive.

Understanding the customer leads to a second selling fundamental: *empathize*—let customers know that you understand their issues and feel their pain. Empathy builds rapport and trust, an important step toward closing sales and building long-term customer relationships. Listening, learning, and empathizing are important first steps, but more is needed. “If all you are is responsive and helpful, then all you are is an administrative assistant,” says the Salesforce sales executive.

So the next important step is to *offer solutions*—to show how Salesforce’s cloud-based solutions will help clients make their sales forces more effective and productive in connecting with and selling to customers. Salesforce believes that the best way to offer solutions is by telling good stories that highlight other customers’ successes with its products. “Storytelling is very, very important,” says Salesforce’s sales productivity manager. “It can be the foundation of things like the corporate pitch and your interactions with your customers and prospects.” When it comes to handling objections—such as “I don’t trust putting our data in the cloud,” “My current system is working fine,” or “It costs too much”—Salesforce tells its salespeople that stories can be the most powerful tools they have. “When faced with objections, we always relate it back to a customer story,” says a Salesforce marketing manager. “We’re not the hero in our customer’s stories,” says another manager. “It’s how the customer succeeded, not how we saved them.”

When it comes to competitors, Salesforce’s salespeople are ferocious. But Salesforce reps are trained to take the high road—to sell Salesforce’s strengths, not competitors’ weaknesses. “Internally, we have these posters: Crush Microsoft and Obliterate Oracle,” says the Salesforce marketing manager. But, he adds, “when you go out to your customers, you have to be careful that you’re guiding them and not just stepping on Microsoft. Even though we all want to.”

Thus, effective professional selling is about much more than glad-handing and back-slapping on the one hand or plying high-tech CRM tools and data analytics on the other. Even though Salesforce boasts the best sales and customer connection tools in the business, backed by big data and combined with plenty of new-school techniques, its sales reps stay focused on old-school selling principles. At Salesforce—or anywhere else—good selling starts with the fundamentals of engaging and listening to customers, understanding and empathizing with their problems, and building relationships by offering meaningful solutions for mutual gain. That’s how you build an incredibly successful sales force and Salesforce.
