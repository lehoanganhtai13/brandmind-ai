## Special Offers

Argos’ commitment to delighting its customers is not only evident in the increasing range of products it offers its customers and the sleek distribution system, but also in the various promotional programs it offers. Some of these are offered to existing loyal customers through the Argos loyalty card scheme while others are to attract new customers. Periodically, it sends its customers various promotional offers, money-off vouchers, and other financing offers. When Black Friday hit the UK high street and its public awareness grew, Argos was quick to explore the opportunity through various special price-cut offers that also attracted a response from many new and existing customers. About 12 million customers reportedly visited the company’s website on the 2015 Black Friday, resulting in 18 purchases in a second. The expectation for 2016 is that around 38 percent more sales than what was recorded for the previous year will have been made.

John Rogers also estimates that at least 70 percent of its orders will be taken online on Black Friday while normal trading will account for 50 percent. The Argos gift voucher promotions, which are managed by the company’s affiliates, offer its customers something to fall back on during their various subsequent purchases. The periodic product-specific special offers on certain products like furniture, computers, and TVs also constitute part of the package that keeps Argos’ stores busy over the years, and with this, it generates customer value profitably.

## Argos and Society

It is tempting to conclude that Argos’s focus on maximizing customer value is predominantly driven by profit. However, evidence suggests that the company does believe in taking responsibility for the environment, improving the local communities, and pursuing a number of initiatives that revolve around long-run benefits for customers and society. Argos is focused on reducing the amount of resources used in its operations and the CO₂ (carbon dioxide) emissions it produces. It clearly communicates its green credentials on its web pages. Apart from its catalog, which is 100 percent recyclable, it sources the paper it uses from sustainably managed forests and encourages customers to recycle old catalogs in their possession as these have proven useful to newspaper print manufacturers. According to the firm, it has already been able to recycle 91 percent of waste from the business, had a 9 percent reduction in its carbon footprint, ensured a 35 percent reduction in the waste sent to landfill, and has established a goal to reduce its CO₂ emission per square foot by 40 percent by the year 2020. Argos’s impacts in the local community are also notable: it supports various charities and other related organizations, and it specifically chose Macmillan Cancer Support as its charity of the year from 2015 to 2017. Argos has shown that it is quite possible to create value for customers and still build relationships with stakeholders.
