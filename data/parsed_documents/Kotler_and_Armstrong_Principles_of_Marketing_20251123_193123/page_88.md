# Marketing Ethics Predicting the Future

It confidently predicted that remote shopping, although feasible, would never be likely to catch on. *Time* made this prediction based on the reasoning that women, in particular, like to handle merchandise before they purchase it. Not only was the prediction hugely inaccurate, it was chauvinistic as well. Global online sales are now in excess of $500 billion. It is not only men who spend massive sums online, but also women, in direct contradiction of *Time*’s prediction. In contrast to this poor prediction, there are cases of articles in the press correctly predicting digital trends in the future, but many predictions still fall short of reality. For example, Robert Metcalf, the inventor of Ethernet, made a prediction in 1995 that, within a year, the internet would spectacularly collapse. In 2007, *The New York Times* predicted that Twitter would never be any more relevant to modern-day communication than an old-fashioned short-wave radio. Tuning into predictions can be dangerous, but should they really be ignored?

**2-11** In some cases, short-term predictions are far more reliable than long-term ones. To what extent should businesses base their long-term planning on the views of “experts”? (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Understanding and Reasoning)

**2-12** Business Monitor International is one of the several organizations that seek to predict future trends in sectors, countries, and financial markets. How are these services sold to businesses as legitimate business planning tools? (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

# Marketing by the Numbers Apple vs. Microsoft

In 2014, Apple reported profits of more than $50 billion on sales of $182 billion. For that same period, Microsoft posted a profit of almost $30 billion on sales of $88 billion. So Apple is a better marketer, right? Sales and profits provide information to compare the profitability of these two competitors, but between these numbers is information regarding the efficiency of marketing efforts in creating those sales and profits. Appendix 2, Marketing by the Numbers, discusses other marketing profitability measures beyond the return on marketing investment (marketing ROI) measure described in this chapter. Review the Appendix to answer the questions using the following information from the two companies’ income statements (all numbers are in thousands):

This data presents a comparative financial overview of Apple and Microsoft, detailing key performance indicators for each company. It highlights Apple's significantly higher Sales of $182,795,000 compared to Microsoft's $86,833,000. Correspondingly, Apple also reports a larger Gross Profit of $70,537,000 against Microsoft's $59,899,000. In terms of expenses, Microsoft's Marketing Expenses are notably higher at $15,474,000 than Apple's $8,994,750. Ultimately, this leads to a substantial difference in Net Income (Profit), with Apple achieving $52,503,000, more than double Microsoft's $27,759,000. The structure is a direct comparison of financial metrics between two major technology companies.

**2-13** Calculate profit margin, net marketing contribution, marketing return on sales (or marketing ROS), and marketing return on investment (or marketing ROI) for each company. Which company is performing better? (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Analytic Thinking)

**2-14** Go to Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com/) and find the income statements for two other competing companies. Perform the same analyses for these companies that you performed for the previous question. Which company is doing better overall and with respect to marketing? For marketing expenses, use 75 percent of the company’s reported “Selling General and Administrative” expenses, as not all of the expenses in that category are marketing expenses. (AACSB: Communication; Analytic Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)

# Video Case Konica

Konica Minolta has been in business since 1873. For decades, it was a successful photo company selling cameras, equipment, and supplies primarily to final consumers. But dramatic changes in the marketing environment forced the company to reevaluate its marketing strategy and ultimately to abandon what had been its primary industry.

Today, Konica Minolta has a successful business-to-business strategy centered on office equipment and print products for commercial printers. The company has also developed a healthcare and medical group, an optics group, and a division that produces components for mobile phones and televisions. With the advent and growth of social media, Konica Minolta’s marketing strategy continues to evolve.

After viewing the video featuring Konica Minolta, answer the following questions:

**2-15** What is Konica Minolta’s mission?

**2-16** What market conditions led Konica Minolta to reevaluate its marketing strategy?

**2-17** How has Konica Minolta modified its marketing mix? Are these changes in line with its mission?
