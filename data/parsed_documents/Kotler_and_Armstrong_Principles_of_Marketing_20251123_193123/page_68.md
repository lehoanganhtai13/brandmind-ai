# Business portfolio
The best **business portfolio** is the one that best fits the company’s strengths and weaknesses to opportunities in the environment.

Most large companies have complex portfolios of businesses and brands. Strategic and marketing planning for such business portfolios can be a daunting but critical task. For example, ESPN’s brand portfolio consists of more than 50 business entities, ranging from multiple ESPN cable channels to ESPN Radio, ESPN.com, *ESPN The Magazine*, and even ESPN Zone sports-themed restaurants. In turn, ESPN is just one unit in the even more complex portfolio of its parent company, The Walt Disney Company. The best business portfolio is the one that best fits the company’s strengths and weaknesses to opportunities in the environment (see Real Marketing 2.1).

Business portfolio planning involves two steps. First, the company must analyze its *current* business portfolio and determine which businesses should receive more, less, or no investment. Second, it must shape the *future* portfolio by developing strategies for growth and downsizing.

# Analyzing the Current Business Portfolio

## portfolio analysis
The process by which management evaluates the products and businesses that make up the company.

The major activity in strategic planning is business **portfolio analysis**, whereby management evaluates the products and businesses that make up the company. The company will want to put strong resources into its more profitable businesses and phase down or drop its weaker ones.

Management’s first step is to identify the key businesses that make up the company, called *strategic business units* (SBUs). An SBU can be a company division, a product line within a division, or sometimes a single product or brand. The company next assesses the attractiveness of its various SBUs and decides how much support each deserves. When designing a business portfolio, it’s a good idea to add and support products and businesses that fit closely with the firm’s core philosophy and competencies.

The purpose of strategic planning is to find ways in which the company can best use its strengths to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the environment. For this reason, most standard portfolio analysis methods evaluate SBUs on two important dimensions: the attractiveness of the SBU’s market or industry and the strength of the SBU’s position in that market or industry. The best-known portfolio-planning method was developed by the Boston Consulting Group, a leading management consulting firm.⁵

## growth-share matrix
A portfolio-planning method that evaluates a company’s SBUs in terms of market growth rate and relative market share.

# The Boston Consulting Group Approach

Using the now-classic Boston Consulting Group (BCG) approach, a company classifies all its SBUs according to the **growth-share matrix**, as shown in **Figure 2.2**. On the vertical axis, *market growth rate* provides a measure of market attractiveness. On the

This table presents a two-by-two matrix, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Growth-Share Matrix, used for strategic portfolio analysis. The matrix categorizes business units or products based on two dimensions: relative market share (horizontal axis) and market growth rate (vertical axis). The upper-left quadrant, labeled "Star," represents high market share and high market growth. The upper-right quadrant, labeled "Question mark," signifies low market share and high market growth. The lower-left quadrant, termed "Cash cow," indicates high market share and low market growth. Finally, the lower-right quadrant, designated as "Dog," represents low market share and low market growth. This structure facilitates decisions regarding resource allocation and strategic planning for different business units.

> Under the classic BCG portfolio planning approach, the company invests funds from mature, successful products and businesses (cash cows) to support promising products and businesses in faster-growing markets (stars and question marks), hoping to turn them into future cash cows.

> The company must decide how much it will invest in each product or business (SBU). For each SBU, it must decide whether to build, hold, harvest, or divest.

- High (top of vertical axis)  
- Low (bottom of vertical axis)  

**Relative market share**  
- High (left side of horizontal axis)  
- Low (right side of horizontal axis) There’s no question: Coca-Cola and PepsiCo dominate the global beverage industry.
