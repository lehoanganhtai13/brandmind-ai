Modeled after Dell’s own iconic social media center, the Red Cross Digital Operations Center broke new ground with an innovative digital volunteer program, adding thousands of trained volunteers around the country to help handle the massive volume of social media traffic that occurs during a disaster.

The Digital Operations Center helps improve the Red Cross’s everyday relief efforts, such as responses to an apartment fire in a large metropolitan area. “Not only are we scanning the social media landscape looking for actionable intelligence,” says a Red Cross manager, “we are also scanning the social space to see if there are people out there who need information and emotional support.”

But it’s the major disasters that highlight the center’s biggest potential. For example, during the week of Hurricane Sandy, one of the biggest natural disasters in U.S. history, the Digital Operations Center played a crucial role in directing Red Cross relief efforts. In addition to the usual data from government partners, on-the-ground assessments, and damage reports from traditional media, the center pored through and acted on millions of tweets, Facebook posts, blog entries, and photos posted online. In all, it tracked more than 2 million posts and responded directly to thousands of people. In at least 88 cases, social media posts had a direct effect on Red Cross actions. “We put trucks in areas where we saw a greater need, we moved cots to a shelter where we needed more supplies,” says the Red Cross manager. Even a lack of social media activity was an important indicator. A social media “black hole” in a specific area probably meant that factors were preventing people in that area from tweeting and that they needed help.

So whether it’s Mastercard, Gatorade, or the American Red Cross, a social media command center can help marketers scour the digital environment, analyze brand-related conversations in real time to gain marketing insights, and respond quickly and appropriately. Ultimately, social media listening gives consumers another voice, to the benefit of both customers and the brand. “It enables us to give the public a seat at our response table,” says the Red Cross manager. Wells Fargo’s Director of Social Media agrees: “Consumers want to be a part of how companies serve them,” she says. “Our nirvana is that if someone offers us an idea, tip, or feedback that really helps us, we respond directly.”

Companies also need to actively monitor competitors’ activities. They can monitor competitors’ web and social media sites. For example, Amazon’s Competitive Intelligence arm routinely purchases merchandise from competing sites to analyze and compare their assortment, speed, and service quality. Companies can use the internet to search specific competitor names, events, or trends and see what turns up. And tracking consumer conversations about competing brands is often as revealing as tracking conversations about the company’s own brands.

Firms use competitive marketing intelligence to gain early insights into competitor moves and strategies and to prepare quick responses. For example, Samsung routinely monitors real-time social media activity surrounding the introductions of Apple’s latest iPhones, iPads, and other devices to quickly shape marketing responses for its own Galaxy S smartphones and tablets. At the same time that Apple CEO Tim Cook is onstage unveiling the latest much-anticipated new models, Samsung marketing strategists are huddled around screens in a war room hundreds of miles away watching the introductions unfold. They carefully monitor not only each new device feature as it is presented but also the gush of online consumer commentary flooding blogs and social media channels. Even as the real-time consumer and competitive data surge in, the Samsung team is drafting responses. Within only a few days, just as Apple’s new models are hitting store shelves, Samsung is already airing TV, print, and social media responses that rechannel the excitement toward its own Galaxy line.

Much competitor intelligence can be collected from people inside the company—executives, engineers and scientists, purchasing agents, and the sales force. The company can also obtain important intelligence information from suppliers, resellers, and key customers. Intelligence seekers can also pour through any of thousands of online databases. Some are free. For example, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s database provides a huge stockpile of financial information on public competitors, and the U.S.
