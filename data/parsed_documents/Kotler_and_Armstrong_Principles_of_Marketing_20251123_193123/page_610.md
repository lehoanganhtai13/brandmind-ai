Today’s enlightened companies are taking action not because someone is forcing them to or to reap short-run profits but because it’s the right thing to do—because it’s for their customers’ well-being, the company’s well-being, and the planet’s environmental future. For example, Elevation Burger has adopted the concept of eating authentic and sustainably prepared food that’s good for the consumers as well as the environment (see Real Marketing 20.1).

**Figure 20.2** shows a grid that companies can use to gauge their progress toward environmental sustainability. It includes both internal and external *greening* activities that will pay off for the firm and environment in the short run and *beyond greening* activities that will pay off in the longer term.

At the most basic level, a company can practice *pollution prevention*. This involves more than pollution control—cleaning up waste after it has been created. Pollution prevention means eliminating or minimizing waste *before* it is created. Companies emphasizing prevention have responded with internal green marketing programs—designing and developing ecologically safer products, recyclable and biodegradable packaging, better pollution controls, and more energy-efficient operations.

For example, in creating new products, athletic shoe and apparel maker adidas considers their environmental impact before ever producing them. This results in low-waste footwear and apparel, such as Element Soul shoes, which yield both performance and sustainability benefits. With their simplified design—only 12 parts instead of the typical 50—the lightweight shoes give athletes a more natural run while at the same time cutting down on materials, waste, and energy use in production. On a broader scale, adidas has developed a restricted substances list for product design and manufacturing: no PVCs, no materials from endangered or threatened species, and less and less materials from non-sustainable sources. adidas has also set ambitious internal goals for reducing greenhouse emissions and energy, water, and paper consumption in its operations. And it has set up Green Teams at locations around the world whose members promote adidas’s environmental programs internally and urge their colleagues to “think green,” such as reducing office waste going to landfills.¹⁷

At the next level, companies can practice *product stewardship*—minimizing not only pollution from production and product design but also all environmental impacts throughout the full product life cycle while at the same time reducing costs. Many companies have adopted *design for environment* (DFE) and *cradle-to-cradle* practices. This involves thinking ahead to design products that are easier to recover, reuse, recycle, or safely return to nature after usage, thus becoming part of the ecological cycle. DFE and cradle-to-cradle practices not only help to sustain the environment, but they can also be highly profitable for the company.

For example, more than a decade ago, IBM started a business—IBM Global Asset Recovery Services—designed to reuse and recycle parts from returned mainframe computers and other equipment. Last year, IBM processed more than 54.3 million pounds of end-of-life products and product waste worldwide, stripping down old equipment to recover chips and valuable metals. Since 2002 it has processed more than 1.09 billion pounds of machines, parts, and material. IBM Global Asset Recovery Services finds uses for more than 99 percent of what

This table outlines a progression from "Today: Greening" to "Tomorrow: Beyond Greening," differentiating internal and external strategies. Under "Today: Greening," internal efforts focus on "Pollution prevention" through waste reduction, while external efforts involve "Product stewardship," aiming to minimize environmental impact across a product's life cycle. Transitioning to "Tomorrow: Beyond Greening," internal strategies evolve to developing "New clean technology," fostering novel environmental skills. Externally, the focus shifts to a "Sustainability vision," establishing a strategic framework for generating sustainable value. This structure illustrates a conceptual evolution from reactive environmental management to proactive, strategic integration of sustainability.

> This framework addresses more than just natural environmental challenges. It also points to opportunities for creating sustainable value for markets and the firm through environmentally sustainable strategies and practices.
