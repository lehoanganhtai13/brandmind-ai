If only cancelling insurance was that simple. If consumers fail to read the small print in their contracts carefully, they are hit by a cancellation fee. With higher percentages of consumers checking insurance quotes on price comparison websites, insurers still take the chance of inertia when the consumers receive their renewal notices. Insurers seem to rely on the fact that a certain percentage of consumers do not bother to read the documents, and if they do, they do not readily notice that the price is far higher than the previous year. The Financial Conduct Authority, which has responsibility for dealing with disputes arising out of financial services, receives around 500 complaints a year regarding insurance renewal. From April 2017, UK insurers are required to include text on their renewal communication to encourage consumers to shop around for the best deal. In cases when consumers have renewed with the same insurer four times, an additional message is required in the renewal communication to encourage shopping around. Insurers are also required to disclose last year’s premium alongside this year’s for clear comparison.

**3-11** Discuss the aspects of the competitive environment of the insurance industry that might encourage this type of practice. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)  
**3-12** Discuss whether or not technology and access to price comparison websites can banish this type of fraudulent practice in the insurance industry. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking)

### Marketing by the Numbers Demographic Trends

Marketers are interested in demographic trends related to variables such as age, ethnicity, and population. The U.S. Census Bureau provides considerable demographic information that is useful for marketers. For example, the following table provides a sample of such population data (see www.censusscope.org/2010Census/PDFs/RaceEth-States.pdf):

This data presents a comparative analysis of total and Hispanic populations across Georgia, Michigan, and California for the years 2000 and 2010. The structure is a state-by-state comparison, with each state's data further broken down by population type (Total and Hispanic) and then by year. Key relationships highlight population changes over the decade. For instance, California shows the largest total population in both years and the most significant Hispanic population, which also grew substantially. Georgia experienced growth in both its total and Hispanic populations. Michigan's total population saw a slight decrease between 2000 and 2010, while its Hispanic population increased. The overarching structure is a time-series comparison of demographic data across distinct geographical entities.

**3-13** What percentage change in the total and Hispanic populations occurred in each state between 2000 and 2010? What conclusions can be drawn from this analysis? (AACSB: Communication; Analytical Reasoning; Reflective Thinking)  
**3-14** Research another demographic trend and create a presentation to marketers regarding the significance of the trend you analyzed. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

### Video Case Burger King

In the fast-food burgers business, french fries are perhaps more important than the burgers themselves. System-wide, Burger King sells 56 million orders of french fries every month—one order of fries for every two customers. But nothing is exempt from the impact of marketing environment forces. As health trends drove some companies to cut back on fatty foods, Burger King saw its french fry sales dip.

So Burger King decided to let people have their fries and eat them to. To bring health-conscious customers back to the counter, Burger King introduced Satisfries—french fries with 30 percent less fat and 20 percent fewer calories than its regular fries. In a product category that has seen little if any innovation, Satisfries could be a big game changer. Still, reduced fat and calories may not be enough to make a difference to health-food lovers. And at 30 to 40 cents more per item, Satisfries may end up as little more than a fry fiasco.

After viewing the video featuring Burger King, answer the following questions:  
**3-15** Considering marketing environment forces, describe how Burger King went about developing its new Satisfries.  
**3-16** With Satisfries, has Burger King truly created customer value, or is it just chasing trends? Explain.

### Company Case Fitbit: Riding the Fitness Wave to Glory

It was 2009. James Park and Eric Friedman were at a breaking point. They’d been flitting around Asia for months, setting up the supply chain for their company’s first product, the Fitbit Tracker. Having raised capital to launch the product with nothing more than a circuit board in a balsa wood box, they were now on the verge of pushing the button to start the assembly line. But with thousands of orders to fill, they discovered that the antenna on the device wasn’t working properly. They stuck a piece of foam on the circuit board and called it “good enough.” Five thousand customers received shiny new Fitbit Trackers just in time for the holidays.
