# Chapter 8 | Products, Services, and Brands: Building Customer Value

Changes often require a huge investment. For example, Southwest’s seemingly simple logo redesign requires sweeping changes that touch almost every aspect of the company’s operations. Just think of all the places you see Southwest’s logo—from its advertising, web, and social media activities to the graphics on its airplanes and the design of its airport gates to its corporate letterhead. Everything must be redone to reflect the new logo look.

Perhaps more important, the old logos closely link brands to the hearts and minds of consumers. Studies show that the stronger their attachments to a brand, the more resistant consumers are to logo changes. For example, although most experts would agree that the new Hershey logo is a vast improvement, some consumers balked, suggesting that the silhouette Kiss resembles a lump of poop. “All I can see is the emoji poo,” says one perplexed observer. “With apologies to Hershey: Your new logo kinda stinks.” And when American Airlines replaced its familiar 45-year-old “AA eagle” logo with a more modern version, the new logo became a flashpoint for both brand fans and detractors. Although the redesign was probably overdue, fans lamented the loss of the classic design, whereas detractors claimed that the millions spent on repainting all of American’s planes should have been invested in improving the airline’s customer service.

Such examples highlight the powerful connections people have to the visual representations of their brands. When logo changes are required—as they most certainly will be at some point—the best course is to alert customers to the upcoming changes and to explain why they are needed. Google did that in a widely distributed video showing the evolution of its logo and the reasons behind the most recent redesign. That’s one reason that its massive logo makeover went so smoothly. As the video explains, “We think we’ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of tomorrow.”

> **Customer service:** From the start, under the Lexus Covenant, Lexus’s high-quality support services create an unmatched car ownership experience and some of the world’s most satisfied car owners.  
> *Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.*

By all accounts, Lexus has lived up to its ambitious customer-satisfaction promise. It has created what appear to be the world’s most satisfied car owners. Lexus regularly tops not just the industry quality ratings but also customer-satisfaction ratings in both the United States and globally. “My wife will never buy another car except a Lexus,” says one satisfied Lexus owner. “They come to our house, pick up the car, do an oil change, spiff it up, and bring it back. She’s sold for life.”

The first step in designing support services is to survey customers periodically to assess the value of current services and obtain ideas for new ones. Once the company has assessed the quality of various support services to customers, it can take steps to fix problems and add new services that will both delight customers and yield profits to the company.

Many companies now use a sophisticated mix of phone, email, online, social media, mobile, and interactive voice and data technologies to provide support services that were not possible before. For example, home-improvement store Lowe’s offers a vigorous dose of customer service at both its store and online locations that makes shopping easier, answers customer questions, and handles problems. Customers can access Lowe’s extensive support by phone, email (`CareTW@lowes.com`), website, mobile app, and Twitter via @LowesCares. The Lowe’s website and mobile app link to a buying guide and how-to library.

In its stores, Lowe’s has equipped employees with 42,000 iPhones filled with custom apps and add-on hardware, letting them perform service tasks such as checking inventory at nearby stores, looking up specific customer purchase histories, sharing how-to videos, and checking competitor prices—all without leaving the customer’s side. Lowe’s is even experimenting with putting interactive, talking, moving robots in stores that can greet customers as they enter, answer even their most vexing questions, and guide them to whatever merchandise they are seeking.  
<sup>15</sup> Beyond decisions about individual products and services, product strategy also calls for building a product line.
