# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

athletes gutting it out in practice and on game day—began on TV but quickly zoomed to the top of the viral charts. The campaign drove home a captivating motivational message: “Do something and be remembered. Or do nothing and be forgotten. No one owns today. Take it.” The initial “Take It” ad broke during NBA All-Star Weekend, but that was only the beginning. The video ad went on to capture a whopping 21 million YouTube views in just the first week and 40 million in the first two months. Additional videos in the ad series grabbed millions more views, making “Take It” one of the most successful viral campaigns of the decade.²⁰

Despite these viral successes, it’s important to note that marketers usually have little control over where their viral messages end up. They can seed content online, but that does little good unless the message itself strikes a chord with consumers. Says one creative director, “You hope that the creative is at a high enough mark where the seeds grow into mighty oaks. If they don’t like it, it ain’t gonna move. If they like it, it’ll move a little bit; and if they love it, it’s gonna move like a fast-burning fire through the Hollywood hills.”²¹

## Blogs and Other Online Forums

Brands also conduct online marketing through various digital forums that appeal to specific special-interest groups and brand communities. **Blogs** (or web logs) are online forums where people and companies post their thoughts and other content, usually related to narrowly defined topics. Blogs can be about anything, from politics or baseball to haiku, car repair, brands, or the latest television series. Many bloggers use social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Instagram to promote their blogs, giving them huge reach. Such reach can give blogs—especially those with large and devoted followings—substantial influence.

Most marketers are now tapping into the blogosphere with their own brand-related blogs that reach customer communities. For example, on the Coca-Cola Unbottled blog, Coke fans and company insiders can “look at what’s beyond the bottle,” sharing posts on everything from new products and sustainability initiatives to fun and inspiring “what’s bubbling” fan stories about “spreading happiness.” On the Netflix Blog, members of the Netflix team (themselves rabid movie fans) tell about the latest Netflix features, share tricks for getting the most out of the Netflix experience, and collect feedback from subscribers. And the creative Nuts About Southwest blog, written by Southwest Airline employees, fosters a two-way dialogue that gives customers a look inside the company’s culture and operations. At the same time, it lets Southwest engage customers directly and get feedback from them.

Beyond their own brand blogs, many marketers use third-party blogs to help get their messages out. For example, some fashion bloggers have amassed millions of followers, with fan bases larger even than the blogs and social media accounts of major fashion magazines. For example, 23-year-old Danielle Bernstein started the We Wore What fashion blog as an undergraduate at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. The blog is now a source of daily outfit inspiration to a fan base of more than 1.4 million. Because of such large followings, brands flock to Bernstein and other fashion blog influencers such as BryanBoy, The Blonde Salad, Song of Style, and Gal Meets Glam, paying them $15,000 or more to post and tag product images in their blog, Facebook, and Instagram sites. Bernstein posts images that contain sponsored products from small brands such as Schultz Shoes and Revolve Clothing to large brands such as Nike, Lancôme, and Nordstrom.²²
