Even in world markets containing similar types of sellers, retailing practices can vary  
widely. For example, you’ll find plenty of Walmarts, Carrefours, Tescos, and other retail  
superstores in major Chinese cities. But whereas consumer brands sold in such stores in  
Western markets rely largely on self-service, brands in China hire armies of uniformed in-  
store promoters—called “promoter girls” or “push girls”—to dispense samples and pitch  
their products person to person. In a Beijing Walmart, on any given weekend, you’ll find 100  
or more such promoters acquainting customers with products from Kraft, Unilever, P&G,  
Johnson & Johnson, and a slew of local competitors. “Chinese consumers know the brand  
name through media,” says the director of a Chinese retail marketing service, “but they want  
to feel the product and get a detailed understanding before they make a purchase.”⁴⁸

> Many large companies, regardless of their “home country,” now think of themselves as truly *global* organizations. They view the entire world as a single borderless market. For example, although headquartered in Chicago, Boeing is as comfortable selling planes to Lufthansa or Air China as to American Airlines.  

# Deciding on the Global Marketing Organization  

Companies manage their international marketing activities in at least three different ways:  
Most companies first organize an export department, then create an international division,  
and finally become a global organization.  

A firm normally gets into international marketing by simply shipping out its goods. If  
its international sales expand, the company will establish an *export department* with a sales  
manager and a few assistants. As sales increase, the export department can expand to in-  
clude various marketing services so that it can actively go after business. If the firm moves  
into joint ventures or direct investment, the export department will no longer be adequate.  

Many companies get involved in several international markets and ventures. A com-  
pany may export to one country, license to another, have a joint ownership venture in a  
third, and own a subsidiary in a fourth. Sooner or later it will create *international divisions*  
or subsidiaries to handle all its international activity.  

International divisions are organized in a variety of ways. An international division’s  
corporate staff consists of marketing, manufacturing, research, finance, planning, and  
personnel specialists. It plans for and provides services to various operating units, which  
can be organized in one of three ways. They can be *geographical organizations*, with country  
managers who are responsible for salespeople, sales branches, distributors, and licensees  
in their respective countries. Or the operating units can be *world product groups*, each re-  
sponsible for worldwide sales of different product groups. Finally, operating units can be  
*international subsidiaries*, each responsible for their own sales and profits.  

Many firms have passed beyond the international division stage and are truly global  
organizations. For example, as discussed previously, despite its French origins, L’Oréal no  
longer has a clearly defined home market. Nor does it have a home-office staff. Instead,  
the company is famous for building global brand teams around managers who have deep  
backgrounds in several cultures. L’Oréal managers around the world bring diverse cul-  
tural perspectives to their brands as if they were, say, German or American or Chinese—or  
all three at once. As explained by one Indian-American-French manager of a team that  
launched a men’s skin care line in Southeast Asia:  

> “I cannot think about things one way. I have a stock of references in different languages: English, Hindi, and French. I read books in three different languages, meet people from different countries, eat food from different [cultures], and so on.”⁴⁹  

Global organizations don’t think of themselves as national marketers that sell abroad  
but as global marketers. The top corporate management and staff plan worldwide manu-  
facturing facilities, marketing policies, financial flows, and logistical systems. The global  
operating units report directly to the chief executive or the executive committee of the  
organization, not to the head of an international division. Executives are trained in world-  
wide operations, not just domestic or international operations. Global companies recruit  
management from many countries, buy components and supplies where they cost the  
least, and invest where the expected returns are greatest.  

Today, major companies must become more global if they hope to compete. As foreign com-  
panies successfully invade their domestic markets, companies must move more aggressively  
into foreign markets. They will have to change from companies that treat their international  
operations as secondary to companies that view the entire world as a single borderless market.
