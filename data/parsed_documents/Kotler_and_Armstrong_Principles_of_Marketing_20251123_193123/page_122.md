# Encountering Hurdles

With high growth rates and plenty of market potential, it would seem that the sky is the limit for Fitbit. But Fitbit still faces numerous obstacles. For starters, privacy issues have increased as technology creates new ways to gather and share information. In Fitbit’s early days, information logged by users was public by default. That meant that as users integrated their information into social networks, their fitness, eating, sleeping, and in some cases sexual activities were being posted for all to see. That was easily remedied by making “private” the default setting. But general concerns about what happens with uploaded personal data remain, even amid assurances from Fitbit that it does not analyze individual data or sell or share consumer data.

But other privacy matters haven’t been so easily managed. Fitness trackers and the data they generate are not regulated. That means that any organization bound by compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has had to tread lightly when adopting a digital tracking device. Fitbit has always been proactive on privacy and information security issues, leading the industry by working with Congress on legislation in this area. Fitbit recently achieved HIPAA compliance, which goes a long way toward putting employers’ fears about privacy and security to rest.

But other concerns remain on the part of both employers and employees. Even as Fitbit and its corporate customers do all they can to allay privacy concerns, many employees have expressed concerns that companies will misuse the data. Concern about what data are being collected and how they are being used has led some employees to wonder whether their Fitbits could be telling employers if they are recovering from a wild night of partying, calling in sick when they really aren’t, or feeling nervous in a meeting or even if they become pregnant.

Although the overall benefits of integrating a Fitbit device into wellness programs and the associated challenges seem clear, there are negative outcomes as well. Health experts point to the potential for a cultural divide between the “dos” and the “do nots.” Employees with disabilities, chronic ailments, or even unhealthy habits may opt out of such programs. Particularly in programs that use leaderboards and group incentives, the result can be to celebrate the fit but demoralize those who are not. And rewards given to those who participate as well as those who succeed are viewed as penalties for those who opt out.

Cheaters are also a concern. Yes, some participants in wellness programs have found ways to fool their Fitbits. For example, a dog can trigger 13,000 to 30,000 steps per day with a Fitbit attached to its collar, easily exceeding the standard 10,000-step goal. Social media sites have erupted with shared practices. “Want to cheat your Fitbit? Try a puppy or a power drill,” suggests one Tweet with a link to instructions. Other methods for logging steps include putting it in the dryer, shaking the fist, attaching it to small children, playing the piano, leading music, and whisking a bowl of chocolate-chip cookie batter. Even the vibrations from riding a Harley or a lawnmower can do the trick.

Beyond these concerns that stand in the way of more widespread acceptance and use, perhaps Fitbit’s greatest challenge is competition. With a dominant market share in the rapidly growing product category that it created, you might think the Fitbit has it made. However, as digital technologies advance on all fronts, it has become apparent that a fitness tracker is not a product. It’s a feature. That became painfully apparent when the Apple Watch hit the market. The Apple Watch wowed the public as a wrist-worn extension of the iPhone with practically unlimited app potential. Its fitness tracking features seemed to minimize those of Fitbit’s products. And if Apple can jump Fitbit’s train as one simple addition to a far more robust product, what other companies and devices might make their way into Fitbit’s territory? And on the software and analytics side, Apple Health and Google Fit seem poised to corner the market with compatibility across mobile platforms.

But Fitbit is hard at work differentiating its wares and positioning itself as more than just a maker of fitness trackers. It has already introduced its own smartwatch. And its “next big leap” is to move beyond fitness tracking into medical diagnosis. By partnering with organizations that can link Fitbit’s products with more detailed clinical research, Fitbit devices could soon replace blood glucose meters and even alert users to dangerous health conditions and disease. If Fitbit can successfully position itself on strengths that competitors have a hard time replicating, the sky may be the limit.
