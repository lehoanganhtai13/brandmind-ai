# 17.2 Mobile Marketing: Engaging Customers Anywhere, Anytime

Armed only with a smartphone or other mobile device, you can learn, do, or buy almost anything these days, from anywhere, and at any time. Google’s Waze app does more than just help you navigate—it pinpoints traffic jams, accidents, speed traps, and gas prices in real time, faithfully updated by members of the Waze community. Is that Redbox kiosk too slow? Download the Redbox app—it lets you find and reserve a DVD using your mobile device and have it waiting for you at the kiosk.

REI’s Powder Project app gives you “backcountry, sidecountry, and secret stashes” ski slope information for locations throughout the United States and Canada. Beyond just the basics like snow conditions, number of open lifts, and trail maps, the app offers webcam views, GPS routing, elevation profiles, forums, and a host of interactive features plus links to REI for times when you decide you can’t live without a new set of K2 skis or a two-man Hubba Hubba tent.

Welcome to the world of mobile marketing. Today’s smartphones and other mobile devices are changing how people live, becoming indispensable hubs for communication, information, and entertainment. They are also revolutionizing the way people shop and buy, giving marketers new opportunities to engage customers in more effective and satisfying ways.

Marketers are responding to the huge growth in mobile access and use. Mobile ad spending skyrocketed 66 percent last year and is expected to more than double in the next four. And the mobile app market has outright exploded. Just seven years ago, Apple’s App Store had a then-astounding 10,000 apps. But by last year, it boasted 1.5 million apps; Android’s Google Play now has the lead with more than 1.6 million apps. Mobile has become today’s brave new marketing frontier, especially for brands courting younger consumers. Mobile devices are very personal, ever-present, and always on. That makes them an ideal medium for obtaining quick responses to individualized, time-sensitive offers.

Successful mobile marketing goes beyond just giving people a coupon and a link to buy. Instead, it enhances brand engagement and creates a “frictionless” buying experience. For example, with Amazon’s mobile app—thanks to “1-click” purchasing, Prime membership, and other features—customers located anywhere, anytime can have products delivered to practically any location in less than 24 hours with nothing more than a smartphone, a simple search or scan, and the click of a button.

Consumers have come to expect such frictionless mobile buying experiences from marketing giants like Amazon. But with recent rapid advances in mobile capabilities, from location-based technologies to mobile payment systems, more and more companies are becoming the Amazons of their industries. Consider mobile app-based car-sharing service Getaround.

In the United States alone, personal cars sit idle for 6 billion car-hours every day. Peer-to-peer car-sharing service Getaround lets car owners earn money by sharing those unused hours with others in the Getaround community for a fee. The young company has already developed a fast-growing base of 300,000 members, who receive 60 percent of the rental fees—an average of $500 to $1,000 per month depending on the car. Getaround takes care of everything—customer contact and support, insurance, roadside assistance, and payment. To use Getaround, you just download the mobile app and supply credit card and driver’s license information. Then you can use the app to search among and view thousands of cars available in the neighborhood and rent one by the hour or day, right when you need it. You locate the car with your phone’s GPS, unlock it with the app, and get in and drive it away. Pay with a credit card on file or using Apple Pay with a single tap. It’s that simple. The Getaround app even provides trip management tools for planning getaways on the go.

Mobile marketing can do much more than simply ease the buying process. It can also take ads, coupons, and other promotions to new levels. Mobile marketers can personalize promotions and weave them into relevant everyday customer experiences. For example, Kiip, a mobile reward network, specializes in helping brands provide customers with just the right reward at just the right time based on their everyday activities. The agency started by embedding its technology into video game apps such as Zombie Farm and Mega Jump. Gamers who reach a new game level or meet some other goal get a coupon to one of their favorite retailers, such as American Apparel.
