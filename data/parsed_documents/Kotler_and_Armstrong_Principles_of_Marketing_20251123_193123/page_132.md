# Chapter 4 | Managing Marketing Information to Gain Customer Insights

A marketing research project might have one of three types of objectives. The objective of **exploratory research** is to gather preliminary information that will help define the problem and suggest hypotheses. The objective of **descriptive research** is to describe things, such as the market potential for a product or the demographics and attitudes of consumers who buy the product. The objective of **causal research** is to test hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships. For example, would a 10 percent decrease in tuition at a private college result in an enrollment increase sufficient to offset the reduced tuition? Managers often start with exploratory research and later follow with descriptive or causal research.

The statement of the problem and research objectives guides the entire research process. The manager and the researcher should put the statement in writing to be certain that they agree on the purpose and expected results of the research.

### Exploratory research  
Marketing research to gather preliminary information that will help define problems and suggest hypotheses.

### Descriptive research  
Marketing research to better describe marketing problems, situations, or markets, such as the market potential for a product or the demographics and attitudes of consumers.

### Causal research  
Marketing research to test hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships.

## Developing the Research Plan

Once researchers have defined the research problem and objectives, they must determine the exact information needed, develop a plan for gathering it efficiently, and present the plan to management. The research plan outlines sources of existing data and spells out the specific research approaches, contact methods, sampling plans, and instruments that researchers will use to gather new data.

Research objectives must be translated into specific information needs. For example, suppose that Chipotle Mexican Grill wants to know how consumers would react to the addition of drive-thru service to its restaurants. U.S. fast-food chains generate an estimated 24 percent of sales through drive-thrus. However, Chipotle—the sustainability-minded fast-casual restaurant that positions itself on “Food With Integrity”—doesn’t offer drive-thru service. Adding drive-thrus might help Chipotle leverage its strong brand position and attract new sales. The proposed research might call for the following specific information:

- The demographic, economic, and lifestyle characteristics of current Chipotle customers: Do current counter-service customers also use drive-thrus? Are drive-thrus consistent with their needs and lifestyles? Or would Chipotle need to target a new segment of consumers?
- The characteristics and usage patterns of the broader population of fast-food and fast-casual diners: What do they need and expect from such restaurants? Where, when, and how do they use them, and what existing quality, price, and service levels do they value? The new Chipotle service would require strong, relevant, and distinctive positioning in the crowded fast-food market.
- Impact on the Chipotle customer experience: Would drive-thrus be consistent with a higher-quality fast-casual experience like the one Chipotle offers?
- Chipotle employee reactions to drive-thru service: Would restaurant employees support drive-thrus? Would adding drive-thrus disrupt operations and their ability to deliver high-quality food and service to inside customers?
- Forecasts of both inside and drive-thru sales and profits: Would the new drive-thru service create new sales and customers or simply take sales away from current inside operations?

Chipotle’s marketers would need these and many other types of information to decide whether to introduce drive-thru service and, if so, the best way to do it.

The research plan should be presented in a *written proposal*. A written proposal is especially important when the research project is large and complex or when an outside
