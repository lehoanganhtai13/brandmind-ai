# Developing New Products and Managing the Product Life Cycle

But more than just being the biggest, Samsung has also achieved that new-product Wow! factor it sought. For example, Samsung has been dominant in recent years at the International Design Excellence Awards (IDEA) presentations—the Academy Awards of the design world—which judges new products based on appearance, functionality, and inspirational thinking. For the past three years, Samsung has been the top corporate winner, claiming more than twice as many awards as the next runner-up.

In this digital, connected, and mobile era, Samsung now competes less with the Sonys of the world and more with innovation pacesetters like Apple. And against Apple, Samsung is more than holding its own. In mobile devices, for example, Samsung has surged to the top of the market. Just a few years ago, Samsung’s goal was to double its market share of smartphones from 5 percent to 10 percent. But the success of its Galaxy line catapulted Samsung’s global share to 22 percent, ahead of Apple’s 18.5 percent worldwide.

In its favor, Samsung holds a piece of the technology puzzle that Apple doesn’t—big screens. In fact, Samsung has been the global leader in television sales for eight straight years. Its Smart TVs not only offer gesture control, voice control, and face recognition but also provide seamless web connectivity that has TV users Facebooking, Skyping, streaming online content, and using their favorite apps with a wave of the hand. Control of so many different kinds of screens gives Samsung a leg up against more-focused competitors in this interconnected age.

But Samsung also realizes that today’s “gotta have it” products can be tomorrow’s has-beens. Future growth will come not just from bigger TVs and better smartphones. Rather, the electronics powerhouse is constantly on the prowl for the “next big thing,” regardless of the product category. To that end, Samsung’s market intelligence and product innovation teams around the globe continually research product usage, purchase behavior, and lifestyle trends, looking for consumer insights and innovative new ways to meet consumer needs.

For instance, Samsung is now investing heavily in the “Internet of Things” (IoT), a global environment where everything—from home electronics and appliances to automobiles, buildings, and even clothing—will be digitally connected to everything else. Given that Samsung already makes products in almost every electronics category, IoT provides fertile territory for future innovation and growth. In recent years, Samsung has begun developing a “web of connectivity” that links its products to the rest of the world. The goal is to develop Samsung IoT products and technologies that are “In Sync with Life.” The company has already introduced numerous “smart” products—including its entire Smart TV lineup, 16 kitchen appliances, and mobile apps—that connect devices to each other and to those who use them.

Samsung’s soon-to-be-released SleepSense device provides just one glimpse into the company’s IoT future:

Samsung’s SleepSense helps you to better understand and manage your sleep. It’s a flat disk that slips under the mattress and provides contactless monitoring of your heart and respiratory rates as well as your movements during sleep. Then, through a smartphone app, SleepSense provides you with daily sleep scores and reports along with expert advice and recommendations based on your own metabolism and other personal characteristics. But here’s the best part. SleepSense also connects to Samsung appliances and third-party IoT devices. For example, when it detects that you’ve fallen asleep during a late-night Netflix binge, it can automatically turn off the television and adjust the air-conditioning for a comfortable sleep environment. In the future, if your Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator detects that you tend to eat dairy before a bad night’s sleep, SleepSense might even advise you on better late-night snack alternatives. Wow!

Samsung’s current IoT lineup is just the tip of the iceberg. According to one estimate, the number of networked devices will surge from about 1 billion today to 25 billion by 2020, representing a $3 trillion market. By that time, Samsung claims that 100 percent of the products it makes will be internet-connected.

Twenty years ago, few people would have predicted that Samsung could have transformed itself so quickly and completely from a low-cost copycat manufacturer into a world-leading innovator of stylish, high-performing, premium products. But through a dedication to customer-focused new-product innovation, that’s exactly what Samsung has done. And even recently, few would have predicted that Samsung would be a driving force behind creating a digitally interconnected world. Yet Samsung seems well on its way to accomplishing that as well.

> “We have to show consumers what’s in it for them and what the Internet of Things can achieve,” says Samsung’s CEO. “To transform our economy, society, and how we live our lives.” Adds another Samsung executive: “We will focus on creating amazing experiences, [on doing] what is right by customers.” In short, whatever gets that “Wow!”¹ | OBJECTIVE 9-1 | Explain how companies find and develop new product ideas.
