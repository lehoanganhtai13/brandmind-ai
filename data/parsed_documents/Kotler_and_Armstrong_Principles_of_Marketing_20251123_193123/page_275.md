### Feeding Pets from Your Smartphone

People lead busy lives, often taking time away from their pets. So Petnet has developed the Smartfeeder, allowing pet owners to schedule feeding times, monitor food intake, and personalize pet nutrition information. The Smartfeeder measures out the appropriate amount of food for a pet based on age, activity, and weight. Additional features include the ability to conveniently store five to seven pounds of pet food in an attached hopper. Petnet has also seamlessly integrated its products with a smartphone app, available with iOS (Apple) products. Pet owners can now control feeding times, portion sizes, and food supply and even order pet food to be delivered directly to their homes, all from a mobile device.

## Marketing Ethics  
### Cutthroat Prices

Multinational corporations such as Gillette were widely criticized in 2017 for perpetuating the price differential between men’s and women’s razors. A survey by *The Times* in 2016 revealed that clothes, beauty products, toys, and other products were routinely more expensive for women than men. According to the newspaper, the prices were 37 percent higher across several product categories. This price discrimination is not new; neither is it restricted to women’s clothes, pink razors, and dolls. A report by the New York City of Consumer Affairs (*From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer* 2015) found that across 800 identical products, on average the female version was 7 percent more expensive. Perhaps part of the explanation is price sensitivity. In other situations, a business will attempt to increase the price out of balance to the increase in cost to them if they can manage it. Sellers do rely on making a greater profit by sneaking “add-ons” or personalizing products. In these cases, the buyer Kellogg, maker of Pop-Tarts, recently introduced Pop-Tarts Gone Nutty!
