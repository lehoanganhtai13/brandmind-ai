The moral: Marketers should care not just about current sales and market share. Customer lifetime value and customer equity are the name of the game.

**Building the Right Relationships with the Right Customers.** Companies should manage customer equity carefully. They should view customers as assets that need to be managed and maximized. But not all customers, not even all loyal customers, are good investments. Surprisingly, some loyal customers can be unprofitable, and some disloyal customers can be profitable. Which customers should the company acquire and retain?

The company can classify customers according to their potential profitability and manage its relationships with them accordingly.

This table presents a framework for categorizing customer loyalty based on two dimensions: potential profitability and projected loyalty duration. The structure is a 2x2 matrix, illustrating four distinct customer segments. High potential profitability combined with short-term projected loyalty characterizes "Butterflies," while high profitability and long-term loyalty define "True friends." Conversely, low potential profitability coupled with short-term loyalty results in "Strangers," and low profitability with long-term loyalty identifies "Barnacles." This model visually maps customer relationships, suggesting strategic approaches may differ based on a customer's profitability and expected duration of engagement.

**Figure 1.5** classifies customers into one of four relationship groups, according to their profitability and projected loyalty. Each group requires a different relationship management strategy. 

- **Strangers** show low potential profitability and little projected loyalty. There is little fit between the company’s offerings and their needs. The relationship management strategy for these customers is simple: Don’t invest anything in them; make money on every transaction.

- **Butterflies** are potentially profitable but not loyal. There is a good fit between the company’s offerings and their needs. However, like real butterflies, we can enjoy them for only a short while and then they’re gone. An example is stock market investors who trade shares often and in large amounts but who enjoy hunting out the best deals without building a regular relationship with any single brokerage company. Efforts to convert butterflies into loyal customers are rarely successful. Instead, the company should enjoy the butterflies for the moment. It should create satisfying and profitable transactions with them, capturing as much of their business as possible in the short time during which they buy from the company. Then it should move on and cease investing in them until the next time around.

- **True friends** are both profitable and loyal. There is a strong fit between their needs and the company’s offerings. The firm wants to make continuous relationship investments to delight these customers and engage, nurture, retain, and grow them. It wants to turn true friends into *true believers*, who come back regularly and tell others about their good experiences with the company.

- **Barnacles** are highly loyal but not very profitable. There is a limited fit between their needs and the company’s offerings. An example is smaller bank customers who bank regularly but do not generate enough returns to cover the costs of maintaining their accounts. Like barnacles on the hull of a ship, they create drag. Barnacles are perhaps the most problematic customers. The company might be able to improve their profitability by selling them more, raising their fees, or reducing service to them. However, if they cannot be made profitable, they should be “fired.”

The point here is an important one: Different types of customers require different engagement and relationship management strategies. The goal is to build the *right relationships* with the *right customers*.

> Marketing doesn’t take place in a vacuum. Now that we’ve discussed the five steps in the marketing process, let’s look at how the ever-changing marketplace affects both consumers and the marketers who serve them. We’ll look more deeply into these and other marketing environment factors in Chapter 3.

# The Changing Marketing Landscape

Every day, dramatic changes are occurring in the marketplace. Richard Love of HP observed, “The pace of change is so rapid that the ability to change has now become a competitive advantage.” Yogi Berra, the legendary New York Yankees catcher and manager, summed it up more simply when he said, “The future ain’t what it used to be.” As the marketplace changes, so must those who serve it.

In this section, we examine the major trends and forces that are changing the marketing landscape and challenging marketing strategy. We look at five major developments: the digital age, the changing economic environment, the growth of not-for-profit marketing, rapid globalization, and the call for sustainable marketing practices.
