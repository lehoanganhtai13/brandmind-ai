# Table 2.2 | Contents of a Marketing Plan

This marketing plan structure is organized hierarchically, moving from broad situational analysis to specific action and control mechanisms. It begins with an **Executive summary** (purpose not detailed in the provided text), followed by a comprehensive **Current marketing situation** analysis that describes the target market and company position, encompassing market description, product review, competition assessment, and distribution channel evaluation. Next, a **Threats and opportunities analysis** identifies potential external impacts on the product. The plan then defines **Objectives and issues**, stating desired marketing goals and discussing factors influencing their achievement. The core **Marketing strategy** section outlines the overarching logic for customer engagement, value creation, and relationship building, detailing target markets, positioning, and marketing expenditure, and aligning with identified threats, opportunities, and issues. This is followed by **Action programs**, which specify the "what, when, who, and how much" of strategy implementation. A detailed **Budgets** section projects revenues and costs, serving as a basis for operational planning. Finally, **Controls** are outlined to monitor progress, review results, and measure marketing investment returns.

Strategic marketing objectives. Whereas marketing planning addresses the *what* and *why* of marketing activities, implementation addresses the *who, where, when,* and *how.*

Many managers think that “doing things right” (implementation) is as important as, or even more important than, “doing the right things” (strategy). The fact is that both are critical to success, and companies can gain competitive advantages through effective implementation. One firm can have essentially the same strategy as another yet win in the marketplace through faster or better execution. Still, implementation is difficult—it is often easier to think up good marketing strategies than it is to carry them out.

In an increasingly connected world, people at all levels of the marketing system must work together to implement marketing strategies and plans. At John Deere, for example, marketing implementation for the company’s residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial equipment requires day-to-day decisions and actions by thousands of people both inside and outside the organization. Marketing managers make decisions about target segments, branding, product development, pricing, promotion, and distribution.
