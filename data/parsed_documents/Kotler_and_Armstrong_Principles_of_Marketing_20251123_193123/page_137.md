# Understanding the Marketplace and Customer Value

practice of putting the marketers behind a one-way mirror to observe groups of moms discussing their brands, the participants and marketers sit in the same room. Guided by a discussion facilitator, the moms begin by educating the marketers about the realities of motherhood—“the raw, real ugly truth about being a mom.” Then the moms and marketers work together to address specific brand issues—whether it’s new product ideas, current product problems, or positioning and communications strategy. The goal is to “turn the challenges of motherhood into growth opportunities for brands.”

Individual and focus group interviews can add a personal touch as opposed to more numbers-oriented, big data research. They can provide rich insights into the motivations and feelings behind the numbers and analytics. “Focus groups are the most widely used qualitative research tool,” says one analyst, “and with good reason. They foster fruitful discussion and can provide unique insight into customers’ and potential customers’ needs, wants, thoughts, and feelings.” Things really come to life when you hear people say them.¹⁴

## Online Marketing Research

The internet has had a dramatic impact on how marketing research is conducted. Increasingly, researchers are collecting primary data through **online marketing research**: internet and mobile surveys, online focus groups, consumer tracking, experiments, and online panels and brand communities.

Online research can take many forms. A company can use the internet or mobile technology as a survey medium: It can include a questionnaire on its web or social media sites or use email or mobile devices to invite people to answer questions. It can create online panels that provide regular feedback or conduct live discussions or online focus groups. Researchers can also conduct online experiments. They can experiment with different prices, headlines, or product features on different web or mobile sites or at different times to learn the relative effectiveness of their offers. They can set up virtual shopping environments and use them to test new products and marketing programs. Or a company can learn about the behavior of online customers by following their click streams as they visit the online site and move to other sites.

The internet is especially well suited to *quantitative* research—for example, conducting marketing surveys and collecting data. More than 90 percent of all Americans now use the internet, making it a fertile channel for reaching a broad cross-section of consumers.¹⁵ As response rates for traditional survey approaches decline and costs increase, the internet is quickly replacing mail and the telephone as the dominant data collection methodology.

Internet-based survey research offers many advantages over traditional phone, mail, and personal interviewing approaches. The most obvious advantages are speed and low costs. By going online, researchers can quickly and easily distribute surveys to thousands of respondents simultaneously via email or by posting them on selected online and mobile sites. Responses can be almost instantaneous, and because respondents themselves enter the information, researchers can tabulate, review, and share research data as the information arrives.

Online research also usually costs much less than research conducted through mail, phone, or personal interviews. Using the internet eliminates most of the postage, phone, interviewer, and data-handling costs associated with the other approaches. Moreover, sample size and location have little impact on costs. Once the questionnaire is set up, there’s little difference in cost between 10 respondents and 10,000 respondents on the internet or between local or globally distant respondents.

Its low cost puts online research well within the reach of almost any business, large or small. In fact, with the internet, what was once the domain of research experts is now available to almost any would-be researcher. Even smaller, less sophisticated researchers can use online survey services such as Snap Surveys (www.snapsurveys.com) and SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com) to create, publish, and distribute their own custom online or mobile surveys in minutes.
