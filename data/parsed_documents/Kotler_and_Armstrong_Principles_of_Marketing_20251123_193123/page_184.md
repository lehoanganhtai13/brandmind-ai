## Marketing by the Numbers  Evaluating Alternatives

One way consumers can evaluate alternatives is to identify important attributes and assess how purchase alternatives perform on those attributes. Consider the purchase of a tablet. Each attribute, such as screen size, is given a weight to reflect its level of importance to that consumer. Then the consumer evaluates each alternative on each attribute. For example, in the following table, price (weighted at 0.5) is the most important attribute for this consumer. The consumer believes that Brand C performs best on price, rating it 7 (higher ratings indicate higher performance). Brand B is perceived as performing the worst on this attribute (rating of 3). Screen size and available apps are the consumer’s next most important attributes. Operating system is least important.

This table presents a comparative analysis of three alternative brands (A, B, and C) based on four key attributes: Screen size, Price, Operating system, and Apps available. Each attribute is assigned an importance weight, with Price holding the highest weight (0.5), followed by Screen size and Apps available (both 0.2), and Operating system with the lowest weight (0.1). For each brand, a score is provided for every attribute, indicating its performance or characteristic in that area. For instance, Brand A scores 4 for Screen size, 6 for Price, 5 for Operating system, and 4 for Apps available. This structure allows for a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the brands across different criteria, weighted by their perceived importance.

A score can be calculated for each brand by multiplying the importance weight for each attribute by the brand’s score on that attribute. These weighted scores are then summed to determine the score for that brand. For example, Score<sub>Brand A</sub> = (0.2 × 4) + (0.5 × 6) + (0.1 × 5) + (0.2 × 4) = 0.8 + 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.8 = 5.1. This consumer will select the brand with the highest score.

### 5-13  
Calculate the scores for brands B and C. Which brand would this consumer likely choose? (AACSB: Communication; Analytic Reasoning)

### 5-14  
Which brand is this consumer least likely to purchase? Discuss two ways the marketer of this brand can enhance consumer attitudes toward purchasing its brand. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking; Analytic Reasoning)

## Video Case  IMG Worldwide

IMG Worldwide is the world’s largest sports entertainment media company. In years past, IMG was all about professional golf and tennis marketing. But today, IMG handles sales and marketing activities for 70 to 80 colleges, making college sports marketing the company’s highest-growth business. In short, IMG handles anything and everything that touches the college sports consumer short of actually playing games on the court or field.

Although you might think that all college sports fans are created equal, IMG finds that nothing could be further from the truth. How different fans consume sports and sports-related activities is affected by geographical, generational, and institutional factors. IMG focuses on comprehensively understanding the process that consumers go through to view or attend a sporting event. It then connects with consumers at each and every stage.

After viewing the video featuring IMG Worldwide, answer the following questions:

### 5-15  
What “product” is a college athletics department selling?

### 5-16  
Discuss how a college sports fan might go through the buying decision process, providing examples for each stage.

### 5-17  
Of the four sets of factors affecting consumer behavior, which most strongly affects how college sports fans consume a sport?
