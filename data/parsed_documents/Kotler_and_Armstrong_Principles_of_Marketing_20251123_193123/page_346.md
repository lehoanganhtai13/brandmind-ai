# Competitor Reactions to Price Changes

A firm considering a price change must worry about the reactions of its competitors as well as those of its customers. Competitors are most likely to react when the number of firms involved is small, when the product is uniform, and when the buyers are well informed about products and prices.

How can the firm anticipate the likely reactions of its competitors? The problem is complex because, like the customer, the competitor can interpret a company price cut in many ways. It might think the company is trying to grab a larger market share or that it’s doing poorly and trying to boost its sales. Or it might think that the company wants the whole industry to cut prices to increase total demand.

The company must assess each competitor’s likely reaction. If all competitors behave alike, this amounts to analyzing only a typical competitor. In contrast, if the competitors do not behave alike—perhaps because of differences in size, market shares, or policies—then separate analyses are necessary. However, if some competitors will match the price change, there is good reason to expect that the rest will also match it.

# Responding to Price Changes

Here we reverse the question and ask how a firm should respond to a price change by a competitor. The firm needs to consider several issues: Why did the competitor change the price? Is the price change temporary or permanent? What will happen to the company’s market share and profits if it does not respond? Are other competitors going to respond? Besides these issues, the company must also consider its own situation and strategy and possible customer reactions to price changes.

**Figure 11.1** shows the ways a company might assess and respond to a competitor’s price cut. Suppose a company learns that a competitor has cut its price and decides that this price cut is likely to harm its sales and profits. It might simply decide to hold its current price and profit margin. The company might believe that it will not lose too much market share or that it would lose too much profit if it reduced its own price. Or it might decide that it should wait and respond when it has more information on the effects of the

This decision tree outlines a pricing strategy in response to competitor price changes. It begins by assessing whether a competitor has cut their price. If not, the strategy is to hold the current price and continue monitoring. If a competitor has lowered their price, the next step is to evaluate the potential negative impact on market share and profits. If the impact is deemed not significant, the strategy is to reduce the company's own price. However, if the impact is significant, the decision tree branches further to consider if effective action can be taken. If no effective action is feasible, the strategy involves raising perceived value. If effective action is possible, options include improving product quality and increasing price, or launching a low-price "fighter brand." This structure represents a hierarchical, conditional decision-making process for competitive pricing.

    When a competitor cuts prices, a company’s first reaction may be to drop its prices as well. But that is often the wrong response. Instead, the firm may want to emphasize the “value” side of the price–value equation.
