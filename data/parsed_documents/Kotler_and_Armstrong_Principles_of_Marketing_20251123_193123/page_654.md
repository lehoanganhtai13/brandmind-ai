# APPENDIX 2 | Marketing by the Numbers

3.3 Hair Zone manufactures a brand of hair-styling gel. It is considering adding a modified version of the product—a foam that provides stronger hold. Hair Zone’s variable costs and prices to wholesalers are:

This data presents a comparative analysis of a "Current Hair Gel" and a "New Foam Product" based on key financial metrics. The structure highlights two distinct products and evaluates them across two primary cost/revenue drivers: unit selling price and unit variable costs. For the "Current Hair Gel," the unit selling price is $2.00, with unit variable costs at $0.85. In contrast, the "New Foam Product" has a higher unit selling price of $2.25 but also incurs higher unit variable costs of $1.25. This comparison allows for an assessment of the profitability and cost structure differences between the existing product and the proposed new offering.

Hair Zone expects to sell 1 million units of the new styling foam in the first year after introduction, but it expects that 60% of those sales will come from buyers who normally purchase Hair Zone’s styling gel. Hair Zone estimates that it would sell 1.5 million units of the gel if it did not introduce the foam. If the fixed cost of launching the new foam will be $100,000 during the first year, should Hair Zone add the new product to its line? Why or why not?
