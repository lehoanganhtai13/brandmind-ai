# Customer Engagement and Today’s Digital and Social Media

a digital key, meaning that travelers do not even need to visit the front desk. Additional features include personalized content reflecting the user’s forthcoming travels, the option to request Uber rides, as well as restaurant recommendations. For future stays, the app offers the option of marking favorite hotels or hotel rooms.16

Significant changes are occurring in the nature of customer–brand relationships. Today’s digital technologies—the internet and the surge in online, mobile, and social media—have profoundly changed the ways that people on the planet relate to one another. In turn, these events have had a huge impact on how companies and brands connect with customers and how customers connect with and influence each other’s brand behaviors.

The digital age has spawned a dazzling set of new customer relationship-building tools, from websites, online ads and videos, mobile ads and apps, and blogs to online communities and the major social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram.

Yesterday’s companies focused mostly on mass marketing to broad segments of customers at arm’s length. By contrast, today’s companies are using online, mobile, and social media to refine their targeting and to engage customers more deeply and interactively. The old marketing involved marketing brands *to* consumers. The new marketing is **customer-engagement marketing**—fostering direct and continuous customer involvement in shaping brand conversations, brand experiences, and brand community. Customer-engagement marketing goes beyond just selling a brand to consumers. Its goal is to make the brand a meaningful part of consumers’ conversations and lives.

The burgeoning internet and social media have given a huge boost to customer-engagement marketing. Today’s consumers are better informed, more connected, and more empowered than ever before. Newly empowered consumers have more information about brands, and they have a wealth of digital platforms for airing and sharing their brand views with others. Thus, marketers are now embracing not only customer relationship management but also *customer-managed relationships*, in which customers connect with companies and with each other to help forge and share their own brand experiences.

Greater consumer empowerment means that companies can no longer rely on marketing by *intrusion*. Instead, they must practice marketing by *attraction*—creating market offerings and messages that engage consumers rather than interrupt them. Hence, most marketers now combine their mass-media marketing efforts with a rich mix of online, mobile, and social media marketing that promotes brand–consumer engagement, brand conversations, and brand advocacy among customers.

* For example, companies post their latest ads and videos on social media sites, hoping they’ll go viral. They maintain an extensive presence on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, Vine, and other social media to create brand buzz. They launch their own blogs, mobile apps, online microsites, and consumer-generated review systems, all with the aim of engaging customers on a more personal, interactive level.

Take Twitter, for example. Organizations ranging from Dell, JetBlue, and Dunkin’ Donuts to the Chicago Bulls, NASCAR, and the Los Angeles Fire Department have created Twitter pages and promotions. They use tweets to start conversations with and between Twitter’s more than 307 million active users, address customer service issues, research customer reactions, and drive traffic to relevant articles, web and mobile marketing sites, contests, videos, and other brand activities.

Engaging customers: Life is good starts with a deeply felt, engagement-worthy sense of purpose: spreading the power of optimism. Then it creates online and social media tools that let people engage and help co-author the brand’s story. © WWPhotography/Alamy Stock Photo 42  PART 1 | Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process
