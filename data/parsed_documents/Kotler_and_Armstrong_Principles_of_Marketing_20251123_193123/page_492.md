# 16.1 B-to-B Salespeople: In This Digital and Social Media Age, Who Needs Them Anymore?

It’s hard to imagine a world without salespeople. But according to some analysts, there will be a lot fewer of them a decade from now. With the explosion of the internet, mobile devices, social media, and other technologies that link customers directly with companies, they reason, who needs face-to-face selling anymore? According to the doubters, salespeople are rapidly being replaced by websites, email, blogs, mobile apps, video sharing, virtual trade shows, social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook, and a host of other digital-age interaction tools.

Research firm Forrester has predicted a 22 percent decline in the number of B-to-B sales reps in the United States over the next five years. That means that one in five sales reps will be out of a job. “The world no longer needs salespeople,” one doomsayer boldly proclaims. “Sales is a dying profession and soon will be as outmoded as oil lamps and the rotary phone.”

So, is business-to-business selling really dying? Will the internet, mobile technologies, and social media replace the age-old art of selling face-to-face? To answer these questions, *SellingPower* magazine called together a panel of sales experts and asked them to weigh in on the future of B-to-B sales. The panel members agreed that technology is radically transforming the selling profession. Today’s revolutionary changes in how people communicate are affecting every aspect of business, and selling is no exception.

But is B-to-B selling dead in this digital and social media age? Don’t believe it, says the *SellingPower* panel. Technology and the internet won’t soon be replacing person-to-person buying and selling. Selling has changed, agrees the panel, and the technology can greatly enhance the selling process. But it can’t replace many of the functions that salespeople perform. “The internet can take orders and disseminate content, but what it can’t do is discover customer needs,” says one panelist. “It can’t build relationships, and it can’t prospect on its own.” Adds another panelist, “Someone must define the company’s value proposition and unique message and communicate it to the market, and that person is the sales rep.”

What is dying, however, is what one panelist calls the account-maintenance role—the order taker who stops by the customer’s office on Friday and says, “Hey, got anything for me?” Likewise, there’s not much of a future for explainers, reps who simply convey product and service information that can be obtained more quickly and easily online. Such salespeople are not creating value and can easily be replaced by automation. However, salespeople who excel at new customer acquisition, relationship management, problem solving, and account growth with existing customers will always be in high demand. “People who do that kind of selling are only going to get more valuable,” says another sales force expert. “That’s not going to go away.”

There’s no doubt about it—technology is transforming the selling profession. Instead of relying on salespeople for basic information and education, customers can now do much of their own prepurchase research via websites, online searches, phone apps, social media contacts, and other venues. Many customers now start the sales process online and do their homework about problems, competing products, and suppliers before the first sales meeting ever takes place. They don’t need basic information or product education; they need solutions and new insights.

According to one survey, business buyers are at least 57 percent of the way through the buying process by the time they reach out to a vendor. So today’s salespeople need “to move into the discovery and relationship-building phase, uncovering pain points and focusing on the prospect’s business,” says a panelist. In fact, jobs for such consultant-type sales reps are expected to grow at a healthy clip during the next five years.

Rather than replacing salespeople, technology is augmenting them. Today’s salespeople aren’t really doing anything fundamentally new. They’ve always done customer research and social networking. Today, however, they are doing it on steroids, using a new kit of high-tech digital tools and applications.

For example, many companies have moved rapidly into online-community-based

Online selling tools, such as SAP’s EcoHub and SAP Store online community-based marketplaces, can help to build customer engagement and generate buying interest and sales. But rather than replacing salespeople, such efforts extend their reach and effectiveness.
