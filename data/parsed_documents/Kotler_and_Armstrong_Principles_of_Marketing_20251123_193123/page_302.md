## Applications and Cases

### Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
#### Telemedicine  
With the majority of health-care costs spent for the treatment of chronic diseases and the reason for most emergency room visits being non-emergencies, the time is ripe for telemedicine. Patients are tapping their phones, tablets, and keyboards instead of making an office visit or trip to the emergency room. Technology makes it possible for doctors to consult with patients through Skype or FaceTime on smartphones, access medical tests via electronic medical records, and send a prescription to a patient’s local pharmacy—all from miles away. The telemedicine industry is still in its infancy, earning only $200 million in annual revenue, but it is predicted to increase to an almost $2 billion industry in just a few years. Technology isn’t the only reason for this industry’s growth. The HITECH Act encouraging electronic medical records is also adding fuel to this fire.

**9-9**  
Research the telemedicine industry and describe two companies offering services. What are the pros and cons of offering medical services this way, and is there governmental or industry guidance for this industry? (AACSB: Communications; Reflective Thinking)

**9-10**  
In what stage of the product life cycle is telemedicine? What role has mobile technology played in evolution of this industry? Explain. (AACSB: Communication; Reflective Thinking)

### Marketing Ethics  
#### The Sustainable Tourist?  
The Thomas Cook Group is probably the oldest and best-known travel and tourism company. It traces its origins back to 1841 and now caters to around 23 million global customers a year. Back in the 1800s, it believed in offering alternative, virtuous, and learning-based leisure activities. Today, in addition to the core purposes of providing relaxing holidays to their customers, Thomas Cook actively aims to provide sustainable and responsible tourism packages. Their stated mission is to manage all of their activities (and the impact of their customers) in a sustainable manner. Sustainable tourism involves ensuring that the company makes a positive difference to the people and to the environment at package destinations. Travel and tourism companies like Thomas Cook recognize that it is vital that popular destinations are preserved, and not just for environmental reasons.

**9-11**  
Sustainable tourism means taking a holistic and broad view of the responsibilities of a travel and tourism business. Outline a likely checklist of considerations. (AACSB: Communication; Ethical Reasoning)

**9-12**  
Choose a popular regional destination for overseas tourists. Research the steps being taken by global travel companies and legislators to protect and preserve the destination. (AACSB: Communication; Use of IT; Reflective Thinking) With the population aging and patients who dread sitting in a sterile dental office, dentists are finding an opportunity in dental house calls.
