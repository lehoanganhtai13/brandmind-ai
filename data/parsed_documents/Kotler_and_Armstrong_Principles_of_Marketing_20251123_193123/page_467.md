# Table 15.2 | Profiles of Major Media Types

This table presents a comparative analysis of various advertising media, outlining their respective advantages and limitations. The structure is comparative, evaluating each medium across key attributes. Television offers broad reach and sensory appeal but suffers from high costs and clutter. Digital, mobile, and social media provide selectivity and engagement at a lower cost, though impact can be limited by audience control. Newspapers are flexible and timely with good local coverage and believability, but have a short lifespan and poor reproduction. Direct mail excels in selectivity and personalization but incurs higher costs per exposure and can be perceived as junk mail. Magazines offer strong selectivity, credibility, and reproduction quality, but require long lead times and are expensive. Radio is cost-effective for local markets with good selectivity but is audio-only and prone to fleeting exposure. Finally, outdoor advertising is flexible, cost-effective with high repeat exposure, but lacks audience selectivity and has creative limitations.

Finally, in their efforts to find less costly and more highly targeted ways to reach consumers, advertisers have discovered a dazzling collection of *alternative media*. These days, no matter where you go or what you do, you will probably run into some new form of advertising:

> Tiny billboards attached to shopping carts urge you to buy Pampers while ads roll by on the store’s checkout conveyor touting your local Chevy dealer. Step outside and there goes a city trash truck sporting an ad for Glad trash bags or a school bus displaying a Little Caesar’s pizza ad. A nearby fire hydrant is emblazoned with advertising for KFC’s “fiery” chicken wings. You escape to the ballpark, only to find billboard-size video screens running Budweiser ads while a blimp with an electronic message board circles lazily overhead. In midwinter, you wait in a city bus shelter that looks like an oven—with heat coming from the coils—shouting out Caribou Coffee’s lineup of hot breakfast sandwiches.

> These days, you’re likely to find ads—well—anywhere. Taxi cabs sport electronic messaging signs tied to GPS location sensors that can pitch local stores and restaurants wherever they roam. Ad space is being sold on parking-lot tickets, airline boarding passes, subway turnstiles, highway toll booth gates, ATMs, municipal garbage cans, and even police cars, doctors’ examining tables, and church bulletins. One company even sells space on toilet paper furnished free to restaurants, stadiums, and malls—the paper carries advertiser logos, coupons, and codes you can scan with your smartphone to download digital coupons or link to advertisers’ social media pages. Now that’s a captive audience.

Such alternative media seem a bit far-fetched, and they sometimes irritate consumers who resent it all as “ad nauseam.” But for many marketers, these media can save money and provide a way to hit selected consumers where they live, shop, work, and play.

Another important trend affecting media selection is the rapid growth in the number of *media multitaskers*, people who absorb more than one medium at a time. For example, it’s not uncommon to find someone watching TV with a smartphone in hand, tweeting, Snapchatting with friends, and chasing down product information on Google.
