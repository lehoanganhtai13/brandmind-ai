i. This is derived by rearranging the following equation and solving for price:  
Percentage markup = \(\frac{(\text{price} - \text{cost})}{\text{price}}\).

ii. Again, using the basic profit equation, we set profit equal to  
ROI × I:  
ROI × I = (P × Q) − TFC − (Q × UVC).  
Solving for Q gives  
$$Q = \frac{TFC + (ROI \times I)}{P - UVC}.$$

v. Total contribution can also be determined from the unit contribution and unit volume:  
Total contribution = unit contribution × unit sales.  
Total units sold in 2017 were 595,238 units, which can be determined by dividing total sales by price per unit ($100 million ÷ $168).  
Total contribution = $35.28 contribution per unit × 595,238 units = $20,999,996.64 (difference due to rounding).

vi. Recall that the contribution margin of 21% was based on variable costs representing 79% of sales. Therefore, if we do not know price, we can set it equal to $1.00. If price equals $1.00, 79 cents represents variable costs and 21 cents represents unit contribution. If price is decreased by 10%, the new price is $0.90. However, variable costs do not change just because price decreased, so the unit contribution and contribution margin decrease as follows:

This data presents a comparative analysis of pricing and contribution metrics under an "Old" and "New" scenario, where the new scenario reflects a 10% price reduction. The "Old" price is $1.00 with a unit variable cost of $0.79, resulting in a unit contribution of $0.21 and a contribution margin of 21%. In the "New" scenario, the price is reduced to $0.90, while the unit variable cost remains constant at $0.79. This price reduction leads to a decreased unit contribution of $0.11 and a significantly lower contribution margin of 12%. The structure highlights the direct impact of a price decrease on profitability, assuming stable variable costs. *This page intentionally left blank*
