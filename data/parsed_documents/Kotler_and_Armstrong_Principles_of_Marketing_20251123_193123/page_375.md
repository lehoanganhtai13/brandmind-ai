# 12.2 Working with Channel Partners to Create Value for Customers

Instead they must create effective value delivery systems, consisting of suppliers, producers, and distributors who work together to get the job done. Partnering with suppliers and distributors can yield big competitive advantages. Consider these examples.

## Toyota

Achieving satisfying supplier relationships has been a cornerstone of Toyota’s stunning success. Historically, Toyota’s U.S. competitors often alienated their suppliers through self-serving, heavy-handed dealings. “The [U. S. automakers] set annual cost-reduction targets [for the parts they buy],” said one supplier. “To realize those targets, they’ll do anything. [They’ve unleashed] a reign of terror, and it gets worse every year.” Says another, “[One automaker] seems to send its people to ‘hate school’ so that they learn how to hate suppliers.”

By contrast, Toyota has long known the importance of building close relationships with suppliers. Rather than bullying them, Toyota partners with suppliers and helps them to meet its very high expectations. It learns about their businesses, conducts joint improvement activities, helps train supplier employees, gives daily performance feedback, and actively seeks out supplier concerns. It even recognizes top suppliers with annual performance awards.

As a result, for 13 of the past 15 years, Toyota has received the top supplier relations score in the respected North American Automotive Supplier Working Relations Index Study. The study rates companies on financial dealings with suppliers, valuing suppliers and treating them fairly, open and honest communication, and providing opportunities to make profits. The study suggests that Toyota suppliers consider themselves true partners with the automotive giant.

Such high supplier satisfaction means that Toyota can rely on suppliers to help it improve its own quality, reduce costs, and develop new products quickly. For example, when Toyota recently launched a program to reduce prices by 30 percent on 170 parts that it would buy for its next generation of cars, suppliers didn’t complain. Instead, they pitched in, trusting that Toyota will help them achieve the targeted reductions, in turn making them more competitive and profitable in the future. In all, creating satisfied suppliers helps Toyota produce lower-cost, higher-quality cars, which in turn results in more satisfied customers.

## L’Oréal

L’Oréal is the world’s largest cosmetics maker, with 23 global brands ranging from Maybelline and Kiehl’s to Lancôme and Redken. Like Toyota, L’Oréal’s extensive supplier network—which supplies everything from polymers and fats to spray cans and packaging to production equipment and office supplies—is crucial to its success.

As a result, L’Oréal treats suppliers as respected partners. On the one hand, it expects a lot from suppliers in terms of design innovation, quality, and socially responsible actions. The company carefully screens new suppliers and regularly assesses the performance of current suppliers. On the other hand, L’Oréal works closely with suppliers to help them meet its exacting standards. Whereas some companies make unreasonable demands of their suppliers and “squeeze” them for short-term gains, L’Oréal builds long-term supplier relationships based on mutual benefit and growth.

According to the company’s supplier website, it treats suppliers with “fundamental respect for their business, their culture, their growth, and the individuals who work there.” Each relationship is based on “dialogue and joint efforts. L’Oréal seeks not only to help its suppliers meet its expectations but also to contribute to their growth through opportunities for innovation and competitiveness.” As a result, more than 75 percent of L’Oréal’s supplier partners have been working with the company for 10 years or more and the majority of them for several decades. Says the company’s head of purchasing, “The CEO wants to make L’Oréal a top performer and one of the world’s most respected companies. Being respected also means being respected by our suppliers.”

## Amazon–P&G

Until recently, if you ordered Bounty paper towels, Pampers diapers, Charmin toilet paper, or any of the dozens of other P&G consumer products from Amazon.com, they probably came to your doorstep by a circuitous distribution route. The paper towels, for example, might well have been produced in P&G’s large northeastern Pennsylvania factory and shipped by the trailer-truck load to its nearby Tunkhannock warehouse, where they were unloaded and repacked with other P&G goods and shipped to Amazon’s Dinwiddie, Virginia, fulfillment center. At the fulfillment center, they were unloaded and shelved and then finally picked and packed by Amazon employees for shipment to you via UPS, FedEx, or the USPS.

But these days, Amazon and P&G have partnered to blaze a new, simpler, lower-cost distribution trail for such goods. Now, for example, at the Pennsylvania warehouse, rather than shipping through multiple warehouses and fulfillment centers, the two companies share warehouse facilities.

Partnering in the distribution channel: Under Amazon’s Vendor Flex program, P&G and Amazon share warehouse facilities, creating distribution cost and delivery advantages for both partners.
