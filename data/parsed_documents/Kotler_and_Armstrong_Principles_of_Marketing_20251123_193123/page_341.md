# Dynamic and Online Pricing

A *fixed-price* policy—setting one price for all buyers—is a relatively modern idea that arose with the development of large-scale retailing at the end of the nineteenth century. Today, most prices are set this way. However, many companies are now reversing the fixed-pricing trend. They are using **dynamic pricing**—adjusting prices continually to meet the characteristics and needs of individual customers and situations.

Dynamic pricing offers many advantages for marketers. For example, online sellers such as Amazon, L.L.Bean, or Apple can mine their databases to gauge a specific shopper’s desires, measure his or her means, check out competitors’ prices, and instantaneously tailor offers to fit that shopper’s situation and behavior, pricing products accordingly.

Services ranging from retailers, airlines, and hotels to sports teams change prices on the fly according to changes in demand, costs, or competitor pricing, adjusting what they charge for specific items on a daily, hourly, or even continuous basis. Done well, dynamic pricing can help sellers to optimize sales and serve customers better. However, done poorly, it can trigger margin-eroding price wars and damage customer relationships and trust. Companies must be careful not to cross the fine line between smart dynamic pricing strategies and damaging ones (see Real Marketing 11.1).

In the extreme, some companies customize their offers and prices based on the specific characteristics and behaviors of individual customers, mined from online browsing and purchasing histories. These days, online offers and prices might well be based on what specific customers search for and buy, how much they pay for other purchases, and whether they might be willing and able to spend more. For example, a consumer who recently went online to purchase a first-class ticket to Paris or customize a new Mercedes coupe might later get a higher quote on a new Bose Wave Radio. By comparison, a friend with a more modest online search and purchase history might receive an offer of 5 percent off and free shipping on the same radio.¹²

Dynamic pricing doesn’t happen only online. For example, many store retailers and other organizations now adjust prices by the day, hour, or even minute. For example, Kohl’s uses electronic price tags in its stores to adjust prices instantly based on supply, demand, and store traffic factors. It can now stage sales that last only hours instead of days, much as its online competitors do. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft adjust their fares dynamically during slow or peak times, a practice called “surge pricing.” Similarly, supply and demand dictates minute-to-minute price adjustments these days for everything from theater tickets to parking spots and golf course greens fees. One Dallas highway even shifts toll prices every five minutes depending on traffic—the fare for one 7-mile stretch, for example, ranged between 90 cents and $4.50 in one week.¹³

Although such dynamic pricing practices seem legally questionable, they’re not. Dynamic pricing is legal as long as companies do not discriminate based on age, gender, location, or other similar characteristics. Dynamic pricing makes sense in many contexts—it adjusts prices according to market forces and consumer preferences. But marketers need to be careful not to use dynamic pricing to take advantage of customers, thereby damaging important customer relationships. Customers may resent what they see as unfair pricing practices or price gouging. For example, consumers reacted badly to reports that Coca-Cola was proposing smart vending machines that would adjust prices depending on outside temperatures. And an Amazon.com dynamic pricing experiment that varied prices by purchase occasion received highly unfavorable headlines.

Just as dynamic and online pricing benefit sellers, however, they also benefit consumers. For example, thanks to the internet, consumers can now get instant product and price comparisons from thousands of vendors at price comparison sites or using mobile apps such as ShopSavvy, Amazon’s Price Check, or eBay’s RedLaser. For example, the RedLaser mobile app lets customers scan barcodes (or search by voice or image) while shopping in stores. It then searches online and at nearby stores to provide thousands of reviews and comparison prices and even offers buying links for immediate online purchasing.

Such information puts pricing power into the hands of consumers. Alert shoppers take advantage of the constant price skirmishes among sellers, snapping up good deals or leveraging retailer price-matching policies. In fact, many retailers are finding that ready online access to comparison prices is giving consumers *too* much of an edge. Most store retailers
