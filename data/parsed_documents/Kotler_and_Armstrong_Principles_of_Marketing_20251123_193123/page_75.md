# Marketing Strategy and the Marketing Mix

The strategic plan defines the company’s overall mission and objectives. Marketing’s role is shown in green circle Figure 2.4, which summarizes the major activities involved in managing a customer-driven marketing strategy and the marketing mix.

Consumers are in the center. The goal is to create value for customers and build profitable customer relationships. Next comes **marketing strategy**—the marketing logic by which the company hopes to create this customer value and achieve these profitable relationships. The company decides which customers it will serve (segmentation and targeting) and how (differentiation and positioning). It identifies the total market and then divides it into smaller segments, selects the most promising segments, and focuses on serving and satisfying the customers in these segments.

Guided by marketing strategy, the company designs an integrated *marketing mix* made up of factors under its control—product, price, place, and promotion (the four Ps). To find the best marketing strategy and mix, the company engages in marketing analysis, planning, implementation, and control. Through these activities, the company watches and adapts to the actors and forces in the marketing environment. We will now look briefly at each activity. In later chapters, we will discuss each one in more depth.

## Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

To succeed in today’s competitive marketplace, companies must be customer centered. They must win customers from competitors and then engage and grow them by delivering greater value. But before it can satisfy customers, a company must first understand customer needs and wants. Thus, sound marketing requires careful customer analysis.

Companies know that they cannot profitably serve all consumers in a given market—at least not all consumers in the same way. There are too many different kinds of consumers with too many different kinds of needs. Most companies are in a position to serve some segments better than others. Thus, each company must divide up the total market, choose the best segments, and design strategies for profitably serving chosen segments. This process involves *market segmentation, market targeting, differentiation,* and *positioning*.

## Market Segmentation

The market consists of many types of consumers, products, and needs. The marketer must determine which segments offer the best opportunities. Consumers can be grouped and served in various ways based on geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral.

### Figure 2.4 Managing Marketing Strategies and the Marketing Mix

This diagram illustrates the core components of marketing, emphasizing the creation of customer value and profitable customer relationships as its central tenet. It depicts a process flow originating with marketing analysis, leading to product development, marketing planning, and subsequent implementation through promotion. This strategic cycle is influenced by various external entities, including marketing intermediaries, suppliers, and publics, all interacting within the competitive landscape. The diagram also highlights key marketing mix elements: Place and Price, which are integral to delivering customer value. The overarching structure suggests a cyclical and interconnected approach to marketing strategy, driven by analysis and culminating in customer-focused outcomes.

> Marketing strategy involves two key questions:  
> - Which customers will we serve (segmentation and targeting)?  
> - How will we create value for them (differentiation and positioning)?  
> Then the company designs a marketing program—the four Ps—that delivers the intended value to targeted consumers.
