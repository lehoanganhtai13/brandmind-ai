# 5.2 Shinola: A Real, Authentic, “Detroit” Persona

One product in each pair really did look like it was made from poop, whereas the other items were genuine products from the hot new American luxury brand Shinola. The contestants ended up taking home “all this beautiful sh*t from Shinola.” The idea for the gag came from the very company that was the butt of the joke, Detroit-based luxury goods maker Shinola.

Shinola opened for business less than five years ago with a line of premium watches priced between $550 and $850. Its unlikely name derives from the old Shinola shoe polish brand that became a household name following a widely circulated story during World War II that a soldier had polished his commander’s boots with poop because “he doesn’t know sh*t from Shinola.”

The original Shinola company closed its doors in 1960, but the founders of the current company purchased the rights to the unique Shinola name, replete with its mildly crude but colorful associations. In another seemingly surprising move, Shinola chose to headquarter itself in Detroit, the once-iconic symbol of gritty American manufacturing and ingenuity that had since fallen into bankruptcy and desperately hard times. Shinola prints the city’s name in its logo and on every product it makes.

Since its founding, Shinola has expanded rapidly into other product categories including high-end bicycles, apparel, leather accessories, and even basketballs. Its sales are booming. Shinola is now sold in high-end department stores such as Nordstrom, Neiman-Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Bloomingdale’s. The company has opened 16 retail stores of its own and faces exploding online demand for its products. And it seems Shinola is just getting started.

Such success might seem surprising. At first blush, Shinola’s name and its Detroit roots seem incongruous with the luxury lines of trendy products it makes and sells. But dig deeper and you find that everything about Shinola binds together strongly under a carefully crafted, all-American brand persona. In an age of products “made in China,” Shinola is on a mission to revive old-time American manufacturing. “We are a Detroit-based company dedicated to quality, craft, and creating world-class manufacturing jobs in the United States,” says the company.

Why the Shinola name and why the Detroit location? “We’re starting with the reinvigoration of a storied American brand, and a storied American city,” says the company. Shinola “is a brand committed to turning out high-quality products in America with . . . American suppliers and American labor,” says an analyst. “To drive home that commitment, the company selected Detroit—the buckle of the American rust belt—as its base.” The brand story just wouldn’t be as compelling if it was based in Chicago or San Francisco.

The brand reflects a gritty Detroit, authentically American persona. So do its products and manufacturing. Shinola began with about 100 local manufacturing employees and brought in the world’s best Swiss watchmakers to train them how to build watches the old-fashioned way—by hand. As the company expanded into other lines, it remained committed to working with mostly U.S.-based suppliers. Leather goods come from the Horween tannery in Chicago, whereas bike frames and forks are hand-built by Waterford, a Wisconsin company. We are “creating a community that will thrive through excellence of craft and pride of work,” says the company “where we will reclaim the making of things that are made well and define American luxury through American quality.”

The roots of American ingenuity and manufacturing are evident in every facet of Shinola’s products and branding, from its Wright Brothers Limited Edition Runwell bike ($2,950 and sold out), to its Bluetooth player with Gramophone speaker ($400 with a waiting list of buyers), to its limited-edition Great American Series Muhammad Ali watch, a tribute to the six principles that shaped the life of the famed fighter: conviction, respect, dedication, confidence, giving, and spirituality.

Shinola products are at once both classic and modern, with clean, functional, and authentically American designs, craftsmanship, and quality. Backed by a lifetime guarantee, they are meant to be handed down from generation to generation rather than to end up in a landfill after a few years of use.

Shinola’s retail stores are the ultimate embodiment of its brand persona. Store interiors have an industrial feel—weathered brick, varnished wood, glass, stainless

Brand personality: Shinola’s carefully crafted, real, authentic, “Detroit” persona has made it one of America’s hottest brands. Shinola steel, and exposed iron trusswork.
