*perceived obsolescence*—continually changing consumer concepts of acceptable styles to encourage more and earlier buying. An obvious example is the fast-fashion industry with its constantly changing clothing fashions, which some critics claim creates a wasteful disposable clothing culture. “Too many garments end up in landfill sites,” bemoans one designer. “They are deemed aesthetically redundant and get discarded at the end of the season when there are often years of wear left.”[^7]

Still others are accused of introducing planned streams of new products that make older models obsolete, turning consumers into “serial replacers.” Critics claim that this occurs in the consumer electronics industries. If you’re like most people, you probably have a drawer full of yesterday’s hottest technological gadgets—from mobile phones and cameras to iPods and flash drives—now reduced to the status of fossils. It seems that anything more than a year or two old is hopelessly out of date.

Marketers respond that consumers *like* style changes; they get tired of the old goods and want a new look in fashion. Or they *want* the latest high-tech innovations, even if older models still work. No one has to buy a new product, and if too few people like it, it will simply fail. Finally, most companies do not design their products to break down earlier because they do not want to lose customers to other brands. Instead, they seek constant improvement to ensure that products will consistently meet or exceed customer expectations.

Much of the so-called planned obsolescence is the working of the competitive and technological forces in a free society—forces that lead to ever-improving goods and services. For example, if Apple produced a new iPhone or iPad that would last 10 years, few consumers would want it. Instead, buyers want the latest technological innovations. “Obsolescence isn’t something companies are forcing on us,” confirms one analyst. “It’s progress, and it’s something we pretty much demand. As usual, the market gives us exactly what we want.”[^8]

## Poor Service to Disadvantaged Consumers

Finally, the American marketing system has been accused of poorly serving disadvantaged consumers. For example, critics claim that the urban poor often have to shop in smaller stores that carry inferior goods and charge higher prices. The presence of large national chain stores in low-income neighborhoods would help to keep prices down. However, the critics accuse major chain retailers of *redlining*, drawing a red line around disadvantaged neighborhoods and avoiding placing stores there.

For example, the nation’s poor areas have 30 percent fewer supermarkets than affluent areas do. As a result, many low-income consumers find themselves in *food deserts*, which are awash with small markets offering frozen pizzas, Cheetos, Moon Pies, and Cokes but where fruits and vegetables or fresh fish and chicken are out of reach. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified more than 6,500 food deserts in rural and urban areas of the United States. Currently, some 23.5 million Americans—including 6.5 million children—live in low-income areas that lack stores selling affordable and nutritious foods. In turn, the lack of access to healthy, affordable fresh foods has a negative impact on the health of underserved consumers in these areas.[^9]

Many national chains, such as Walmart, Walgreens, SuperValu, and even Whole Foods Market have recently agreed to open or expand more stores that bring nutritious and fresh foods to underserved communities. Other retailers have found that they can operate profitably by focusing on low-income areas ignored by other companies. Consider Brown’s Super Stores, Inc., in Philadelphia:[^10]

> When Jeff Brown opened his first grocery store in a low-income Southwest Philly neighborhood, most people thought he was crazy. How could he make money in a food desert? But Brown now operates seven profitable ShopRite stores in low-income areas in and around Philadelphia. Brown knows that serving consumers in low-income areas takes more than just opening a store and stocking it with healthy foods. Prices have to be low. At the same time, food quality and service have to be

Serving underserved consumers: Jeff Brown’s seven ShopRite stores operate profitably in low-income Philadelphia neighborhoods by becoming a part of the communities they serve.
