# 5 Consumer Markets and Buyer Behavior

You've studied how marketers obtain, analyze, and use information to develop customer insights and assess marketing programs. In this chapter, we take a closer look at the most important element of the marketplace—customers. The aim of marketing is to engage customers and affect how they think and act. To affect the *whats*, *whens*, and *hows* of buyer behavior, marketers must first understand the *whys*. In this chapter, we look at *final consumer* buying influences and processes. In the next chapter, we'll study the buyer behavior of *business customers*. You'll see that understanding buyer behavior is an essential but very difficult task.

To get a better sense of the importance of understanding consumer behavior, we begin by looking at Lenovo, the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales. Before it acquired IBM's computer business, you might never have heard of Lenovo. Yet few brands can match the avid enthusiasm and intense loyalty that Lenovo has generated in its customers. Its business model is thus built on customer satisfaction, innovation, and operational efficiency.

## LENOVO: Understanding Customers and Building Profitable Relationships

Lenovo was established in Beijing, China, in 1984 by 11 members of the Computer Technology Research Institute. Originally founded as Legend by Liu Chunzhi with a group of 10 engineers, the company decided to abandon the brand name in 2002 to expand internationally, and so its name was changed to Lenovo. In 2005, the company acquired IBM’s personal computer business, including the ThinkPad laptop and tablet lines. This acquisition accelerated access to foreign markets and made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume. In 2015, Lenovo was the world’s largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and had operations in more than 60 countries, with products sold in around 160 countries.

The global success of Lenovo is rooted in its deep and sound understanding of customers and its ability to build profitable relationships. The business model is thus built on customer satisfaction, innovation, and operational efficiency. Lenovo’s marketers spend a great deal of time thinking about customers and their buying behavior. They want to know who their customers are. What do they think? How do they feel about the products? What makes them tick? In order to arrive at comprehensive answers to these questions, Lenovo’s product design and engineering teams listen to their customers through their social media channels, forums, blogs, and fan clubs around the world.

The company highly values the input of its customers and tracks it accordingly. For example, after Lenovo had introduced new variants of its Lenovo ThinkPad series in 2012 and 2013, customers complained on internet forums that the two physical TrackPoint buttons had been removed from the touchpad at the bottom of the keyboard. These buttons correspond to the left and right mouse buttons on a conventional mouse and work as a substitute to an external mouse or touchpad. Always with an ear to the ground, Lenovo soon realized this issue and publicly admitted that they had made a big mistake. Soon afterwards, they brought back the TrackPoint buttons.

Lenovo’s product development is always driven by deep customer understanding from around the globe. The company emphasizes on its websites that every time customers provide feedback in some form, they are actually and personally helping to influence the next wave of technology that it puts into the market.
