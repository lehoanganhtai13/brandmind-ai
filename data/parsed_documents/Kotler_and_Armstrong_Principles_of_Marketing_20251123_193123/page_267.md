For example, Whirlpool can position its major home appliance products on attributes such as quality, selection, style, and innovative features. In general, however, attributes are the least desirable level for brand positioning. Competitors can easily copy attributes. More important, customers are not interested in attributes as such—they are interested in what the attributes will do for them.

A brand can be better positioned by associating its name with a desirable *benefit*. Thus, Whirlpool can go beyond technical product attributes and talk about benefits such as taking the hassle out of cooking and cleaning, better energy savings, or more stylish kitchens. For example, for years, Whirlpool positioned its washing machines as having “the power to get more done.” Some successful brands positioned on benefits are FedEx (guaranteed on-time delivery), Walmart (save money), and Instagram (capturing and sharing moments).

The strongest brands go beyond attribute or benefit positioning. They are positioned on strong *beliefs and values*, engaging customers on a deep, emotional level. For example, Whirlpool’s research showed that home appliances are more than just “cold metal” to customers. They have a deeper meaning connected with the value that they play in customers’ lives and relationships. So Whirlpool launched a major positioning campaign—called “Every Day, Care”—based on the warm emotions of taking care of the people you love with Whirlpool appliances. One ad shows a father leaving a note in his son’s lunch, accompanied by Johnny Cash singing “You Are My Sunshine” in the background. Another ad centers on a mom’s interactions with her daughter around their Whirlpool washer-dryer, and still another shows a couple cooking dinner together with the wish, “May your ‘tatoes be fluffy and white.” Warming up cold metal worked wonders for Whirlpool. Within just six months, the brand’s sales rose 6.6 percent, market share increased 10 percent, and positive social media sentiment surged sixfold.³⁰

Advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi suggests that brands should strive to become *lovemarks*, products or services that “inspire loyalty beyond reason.” Brands ranging from Disney, Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola to Trader Joe’s, Google, and Pinterest have achieved this status with many of their customers. Lovemark brands pack an emotional wallop. Customers don’t just like these brands; they have strong emotional connections with them and love them unconditionally.³¹  

For example, Disney is a classic lovemark brand. As one Walt Disney World Resort regular affirms:  
> “I have a deep love and bond to all things Disney. Walking down Main Street and seeing Cinderella’s castle for the first time always makes my heart jump. It’s a moment I can guarantee and rely on. A constant in my life. No matter what I’m going through... suddenly the world is filled with magic and wonder and possibilities all over again and I feel a wave of happiness flow over me and a smile creep back onto my face easily, not forced or painted on. A real, true smile.”³²

When positioning a brand, the marketer should establish a mission for the brand and a vision of what the brand must be and do. A brand is the company’s promise to deliver a specific set of features, benefits, services, and experiences consistently to buyers. The brand promise must be clear, simple, and honest. Motel 6, for example, offers clean rooms, low prices, and good service but does not promise expensive furnishings or large bathrooms. In contrast, the Ritz-Carlton offers luxurious rooms and a truly memorable experience but does not promise low prices.

## Brand Name Selection

A good name can add greatly to a product’s success. However, finding the best brand name is a difficult task. It begins with a careful review of the product and its benefits, the target market, and proposed marketing strategies. After that, naming a brand becomes part science, part art, and a measure of instinct.
