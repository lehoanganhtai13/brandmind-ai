For example, in a 2016 national referendum, the people of the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. Although actual British separation from the EU could take many forms and require years of negotiations, the “Brexit” vote sent aftershocks across Europe and the world, raising substantial concerns about the future of European economic and political unity. Still, with a combined annual GDP approaching $20 trillion, the EU remains a potent economic force.¹²

In 1994, the *North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)* established a free trade zone among the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The agreement created a single market of 478 million people who produce and consume $20.75 trillion worth of goods and services annually. Over the past 20 years, NAFTA has eliminated trade barriers and investment restrictions among the three countries. Total trade among the NAFTA countries nearly tripled from $288 billion in 1993 to more than $1.1 trillion a year.¹³

Following the apparent success of NAFTA, in 2005 the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) established a free trade zone between the United States and Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Other free trade areas have formed in Latin America and South America. For example, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), modeled after the EU, was formed in 2004 and formalized by a constitutional treaty in 2008. Consisting of 12 countries, UNASUR makes up the largest trading bloc after NAFTA and the EU, with a population of more than 418 million and a combined economy of more than $4.1 trillion. Similar to NAFTA and the EU, UNASUR aims to eliminate all tariffs between nations by 2019.¹⁴

Two other major world trade agreements are the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The recently signed TPP promises to lower trade barrier and increase economic cooperation among twelve Pacific Rim countries: the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The companion TTIP agreement between the United States and the European Union is still under negotiation. These major trade agreements will have a significant and sometimes controversial economic and political impact. For example, the 12 TPP countries have a collective population of 800 million people, nearly double that of the EU, and account for 40 percent of all world trade.¹⁵

Each nation has unique features that must be understood. A nation’s readiness for different products and services and its attractiveness as a market to foreign firms depend on its economic, political-legal, and cultural environments.

## Economic Environment

The international marketer must study each country’s economy. Two economic factors reflect the country’s attractiveness as a market: its industrial structure and its income distribution.

The country’s *industrial structure* shapes its product and service needs, income levels, and employment levels. For example, in *subsistence economies*, most people engage in simple agriculture, consume most of their output, and barter the rest for simple goods and services. These economies offer few market opportunities. Many African countries fall into this category. At the other extreme, *industrial economies* are major importers and exporters of manufactured goods and services. Their varied manufacturing activities and large middle classes make them rich markets for all sorts of goods. The United States, Japan, and the Western European countries are examples.

*Emerging economies* are those experiencing rapid economic growth and industrialization. Examples include the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Other hot emerging markets include Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, and Turkey (CIVITS). Industrialization typically creates a new rich class and a growing middle class, both demanding new types of goods and services. As more-developed markets stagnate and become increasingly competitive, many marketers are now targeting growth opportunities in emerging markets.

The second economic factor is the country’s *income distribution*. Industrialized nations may have low-, medium-, and high-income households. In contrast, countries with subsistence economies consist mostly of households with very low family incomes. Still other countries may have households with either very low or very high incomes. Even poor or emerging economies may be attractive markets for all kinds of goods.
