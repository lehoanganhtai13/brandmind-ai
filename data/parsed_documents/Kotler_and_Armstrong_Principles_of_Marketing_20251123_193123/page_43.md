Similarly, almost every company has something going on Facebook these days. Starbucks has more than 36 million Facebook “fans”; Coca-Cola has more than 96 million. And every major marketer has a YouTube channel where the brand and its fans post current ads and other entertaining or informative videos. Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, Vine—all have exploded onto the marketing scene, giving brands more ways to engage and interact with customers. Skilled use of social media can get consumers involved with a brand, talking about it, and advocating it to others.

The key to engagement marketing is to find ways to enter targeted consumers’ conversations with engaging and relevant brand messages. Simply posting a humorous video, creating a social media page, or hosting a blog isn’t enough. And not all customers want to engage deeply or regularly with every brand. Successful engagement marketing means making relevant and genuine contributions to targeted consumers’ lives and interactions. Consider T-shirt and apparel maker Life is good:17

> For starters, Life is good has an authentic, engagement-worthy sense of purpose: spreading the power of optimism. The brand is about helping people to open up, create relationships, and connect with other people. The company’s infectious philosophy is best represented by the “Life is good” slogan itself and by Jake—the familiar beret-wearing, happy-go-lucky stick figure who quickly became a pop-culture icon. Life is good backs its optimism philosophy with good deeds, donating 10 percent of its net profits each year to help kids in need.  
> Online and social media have become a perfect fit for sharing the Life is good message. Today, the brand fosters a thriving community of Optimists, with more than 2.6 million Facebook fans, 304,000 Twitter followers, 33,000 followers on Instagram, and an active YouTube channel. But the strongest engagement platform is the brand’s own website, Lifeisgood.com, one of the most active customer-engagement sites found anywhere online. The site’s “Live It” section gives brand fans a breath of “fresh share.” It’s a place where they share photos, videos, and stories showing the brand’s role in their trials, triumphs, and optimism. To Life is good, true engagement is about deep meaningful relationships that go beyond the products it is selling. Says Life is good CEO Bert Jacobs: “You can’t build a brand on your own; we have entered a world where customers co-author your story.”

### Consumer-Generated Marketing

> **Consumer-generated marketing**  
> Brand exchanges created by consumers themselves—both invited and uninvited—by which consumers are playing an increasing role in shaping their own brand experiences and those of other consumers.

One form of customer-engagement marketing is **consumer-generated marketing**, by which consumers themselves play role in shaping their own brand experiences and those of others. This might happen through uninvited consumer-to-consumer exchanges in blogs, video-sharing sites, social media, and other digital forums. But increasingly, companies themselves are inviting consumers to play a more active role in shaping products and brand content.

Some companies go directly to their customers for new product ideas and designs. For example, Airbus claims that the interior of its new A330neo aircraft, which is set to launch in 2017, is mainly designed based on comments gathered from disgruntled passengers on social media. The aerospace company then proposed an 18-inch (45.72 cm) seat width as the standard for future long-haul economy air travel. It commissioned new scientific research and revealed its findings on social media with the hashtag #AirbusComfort. The research demonstrated that a minimum seat width of 18 inches improves passenger sleep quality by 53 percent when compared to the 1950s 17-inch standard. For over a day, the campaign’s message was run in six languages, including live responses and monitoring. The campaign secured more than 70 million impressions and there was notable uplift in community size. Airbus is taking this to the next level in 2017 with the “Fly Your Ideas” campaign, which is an online competition for international students from all disciplines to develop new ideas.18

Other companies invite customers to play an active role in shaping ads and brand content. For example, for 10 full years, PepsiCo’s Doritos brand held a “Crash the Super Bowl” contest that invited 30-second ads from consumers and ran the best ones during the game. The contest attracted thousands of entries from around the world, and the hugely popular consumer-generated ads routinely finished in the top five of the *USA Today*’s AdMeter rankings. Based on the success of the “Crash the Super Bowl” contest, Doritos now runs new campaigns that create fun fan-made ads and other content throughout the year.19

Many brands incorporate user-generated social media content into their own traditional marketing and social media campaigns. For example, Mountain Dew stirred up and employed user-generated content to create buzz around a limited-time reintroduction of its iconic Baja Blast flavor. It began with a discreet Rogue Wave social media campaign in which it posted tantalizing hints on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter about bringing Baja Blast back. For example, on Snapchat, the brand showed quick clips of Mountain Dew Tweet:
