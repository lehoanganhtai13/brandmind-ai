# Designing a Customer Value–Driven Strategy and Mix

As a result, at the very least, most global consumer brands coordinate their digital sites internationally. For example, Coca-Cola web and social media sites around the world, from Australia and Argentina to France, Romania, and Russia, are surprisingly uniform. All feature splashes of familiar Coke red, iconic Coke bottle shapes, and Coca-Cola’s music and “Taste the Feeling” themes.

Standardization produces many benefits—lower advertising costs, greater global advertising coordination, and a more consistent worldwide image. But it also has drawbacks. Most important, it ignores the fact that country markets differ greatly in their cultures, demographics, and economic conditions. Thus, most international advertisers “think globally but act locally.” They develop global advertising *strategies* that make their worldwide efforts more efficient and consistent. Then they adapt their advertising *programs* to make them more responsive to consumer needs and expectations within local markets. For example, although Visa employs its “Everywhere you want to be” theme globally, ads in specific locales employ local language and inspiring local imagery that make the theme relevant to the local markets in which they appear.

Global advertisers face several special problems. For instance, advertising media costs and availability differ vastly from country to country. Countries also differ in the extent to which they regulate advertising practices. Many countries have extensive systems of laws restricting how much a company can spend on advertising, the media used, the nature of advertising claims, and other aspects of the advertising program. Such restrictions often require advertisers to adapt their campaigns from country to country.

Thus, although advertisers may develop global strategies to guide their overall advertising efforts, specific advertising programs must usually be adapted to meet local cultures and customs, media characteristics, and regulations.

## Public Relations

Another major promotion tool, **public relations**, consists of activities designed to engage and build good relations with the company’s various publics. PR may include any or all of the following functions:  
- *Press relations or press agency.* Creating and placing newsworthy information in the news media to attract attention to a person, product, or service.  
- *Product and brand publicity.* Publicizing specific products and brands.  
- *Public affairs.* Building and maintaining national or local community relationships.  
- *Lobbying.* Building and maintaining relationships with legislators and government officials to influence legislation and regulation.  
- *Investor relations.* Maintaining relationships with shareholders and others in the financial community.  
- *Development.* Working with donors or members of nonprofit organizations to gain financial or volunteer support.

Public relations is used to promote products, people, places, ideas, activities, organizations, and even nations. Companies use PR to build good relations with consumers, investors, the media, and their communities. PR is often used to build support for newsworthy company events and actions. For example, a few years ago when CVS Health announced its bold decision to stop selling cigarettes and tobacco products in its stores, even though it meant sacrificing $2 billion in tobacco-related revenues, it knew that the decision would make headlines. But it left little to chance about how the full story would be told. Instead, CVS crafted a comprehensive “CVS Quits for Good” public relations campaign to tell consumers, Wall Street, and the health-care community that the decision would benefit both customers and the company:

> The “CVS Quits” PR campaign kicked off with full-page ads in *The New York Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, the *Boston Globe*, and other major newspapers along with multimedia news releases featuring video announcements from CVS’s president and other company leaders. The ads and releases explained that dropping tobacco products “is simply the right thing to do for the good of our customers and our company,” consistent “with our purpose—helping people on their path to better health.” CVS also created an information-packed cvs-quits.com microsite along with a #cvsquits hashtag and banners announcing the decision on the company’s many web and social media sites. The “CVS Quits” story was snapped up by Like other promotional forms, public relations has the power to engage consumers and make a brand part of their lives and conversations.
