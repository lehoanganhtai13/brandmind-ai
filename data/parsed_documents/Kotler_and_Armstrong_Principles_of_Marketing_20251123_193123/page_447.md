## APPLICATIONS AND CASES

### Online, Mobile, and Social Media Marketing  
#### Spot the Difference

Online newspapers and magazines need most of the content they publish to be current, up-to-date, and in vogue. However, very few readers actually want to pay to access that content. The solution seems simple: use thinly disguised advertorial content instead. Interestingly, the more the content is read, the greater the advertising revenue. To many readers, it would now appear that a few online content sites are prepared to take the risk of paying a proper journalist or travel writer to create an article or a piece of high-quality copy. Instead, content is either advertorial material or fairly dull practical advice. This also means that opportunities of making a living for journalists are dwindling. The subscription systems put people off, and it is impossible to subscribe to a specific section of a newspaper or magazine to keep up with news and events from a specific perspective. A great deal of writing on news and media sites has become an integral part of public relations rather than conventional journalism. Some sites simply reprint press releases without comment or changes. Others will turn to business organizations that have customized-content providers to create a piece for them in different styles to match the look of different news websites.  

A major marketing trend has been to create content for brands. This has blurred the fine line between paid media coverage or advertisements and earned media coverage, which is more about convincing a journalist that a brand deserves to be written about. This has also created a conflict between different parts of the marketing industry. PR specialists would suggest they are better placed to write the customized content and they can find a newsworthy story for a brand. Advertising specialists claim they are the ones with the greatest affinity with advertorials, and they would know better how to make something stand out. As the distinction between opinionated news content and customized content, also presented with a clear opinion and purpose, become ever more blurred, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the reader to tell the difference. As advertising revenue becomes more diluted with increased competition, should we blame the media for looking for a new income stream? Brands deserve their own story too, and it looks like the media is ready to write it for them.
