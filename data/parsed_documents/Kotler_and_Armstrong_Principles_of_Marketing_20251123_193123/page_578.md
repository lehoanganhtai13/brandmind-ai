And the thing that binds the world’s teens together in a kind of global community, notes one observer, “is American culture—the music, the Hollywood fare, the electronic games, Google, Facebook, American consumer brands. The . . . rest of the world is becoming [evermore] like us—in ways good and bad.”[^23]

“Today, globalization often wears Mickey Mouse ears, eats Big Macs, drinks Coke or Pepsi, and does its computing with Windows,” says Thomas Friedman in his book *The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization.* “Some Chinese kids’ first English word [is] Mickey,” notes another writer.[^24]

Critics worry that, under such “McDomination,” countries around the globe are losing their individual cultural identities. Teens in Turkey watch MTV, connect with others globally through Facebook and Twitter, and ask their parents for more Westernized clothes and other symbols of American pop culture and values. Grandmothers in small European villas no longer spend each morning visiting local meat, bread, and produce markets to gather the ingredients for dinner. Instead, they now shop at Walmart. Women in Saudi Arabia see American films, question their societal roles, and shop at any of the country’s growing number of Victoria’s Secret boutiques. In China, most people never drank coffee before Starbucks entered the market. Now Chinese consumers rush to Starbucks stores because it symbolizes a new kind of lifestyle. Similarly, in China, where McDonald’s operates more than 80 restaurants in Beijing alone, nearly half of all children identify the chain as a domestic brand.

Such concerns have sometimes led to a backlash against American globalization. Well-known U.S. brands have become the targets of boycotts and protests in some international markets. As symbols of American capitalism, companies such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nike, and KFC have been singled out by protestors and governments in hot spots around the world, especially when anti-American sentiment peaks. For example, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the resulting sanctions by the West, Russian authorities initiated a crackdown on McDonald’s franchises (even though most were Russian-owned), forcing some to close for uncertain reasons. McDonald’s flagship store in Moscow was shut down for several weeks by the Russian Food Safety Authority. And the three McDonald’s in Crimea were permanently shuttered, with at least one becoming a nationalist chain outlet called Rusburger, serving “Czar Cheeseburgers” where Quarter Pounders once flowed.[^25]

Despite such problems, defenders of globalization argue that concerns of Americanization and the potential damage to American brands are overblown. U.S. brands are doing very well internationally. In the most recent Millward Brown BrandZ brand value survey of global consumer brands, 19 of the top 25 global brands were American owned, including megabrands such as Google, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, GE, Amazon.com, and Walmart.[^26]

Many iconic American brands are soaring globally. For example, most international markets covet American fast food. Consider KFC in Japan. On the day that KFC introduced its outrageous Double Down sandwich—bacon, melted cheese, and a “secret sauce” between two deep-fried chicken patties—in one of its restaurants in Japan, fans formed long lines and slept on the sidewalks outside to get a taste. “It was like the iPhone,” says the CMO of KFC International, “people [were] crazy.” The U.S. limited-time item has since become a runaway success worldwide, from Canada to Australia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. More broadly, KFC has become its own cultural institution in Japan. For instance, the brand has long been one of Japan’s leading Christmas dining traditions, with the iconic Colonel Sanders standing in as a kind of Japanese Father Christmas:[^27]

> Japan’s KFC Christmas tradition began more than 40 years ago when the company unleashed a “Kentucky for Christmas” advertising campaign in Japan to help the brand get off the ground. Now, eating Kentucky Fried Chicken has become one of the country’s most popular holiday traditions. Each KFC store displays a life-size Colonel Sanders statue, adorned in a traditional fur-trimmed red suit and Santa hat. A month in advance, Japanese customers order their special Christmas meal—a special bucket of fried chicken with wine and cake for about
