# Buying Decision Behavior and the Buyer Decision Process

## Types of Buying Decision Behavior

Buying behavior differs greatly for a tube of toothpaste, a smartphone, financial services, and a new car. More complex decisions usually involve more buying participants and more buyer deliberation.  
**Figure 5.4** shows the types of consumer buying behavior based on the degree of buyer involvement and the degree of differences among brands.

### Complex Buying Behavior

Consumers undertake **complex buying behavior** when they are highly involved in a purchase and perceive significant differences among brands. Consumers may be highly involved when the product is expensive, risky, purchased infrequently, and highly self-expressive. Typically, the consumer has much to learn about the product category. For example, someone buying a new car might not know what models, attributes, and accessories to consider or what prices to expect.

This buyer will pass through a learning process, first developing beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then make a thoughtful purchase choice. Marketers of high-involvement products must understand the information-gathering and evaluation behavior of high-involvement consumers. They need to help buyers learn about product-class attributes and their relative importance. They need to differentiate their brand’s features, perhaps by describing and illustrating the brand’s benefits through printed promotional materials or in-depth online information and videos. They must motivate store salespeople and the buyer’s acquaintances to influence the final brand choice.

### Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior

**Dissonance-reducing buying behavior** occurs when consumers are highly involved with an expensive, infrequent, or risky purchase but see little difference among brands. For example, consumers buying carpeting may face a high-involvement decision because carpeting is expensive and self-expressive. Yet buyers may consider most carpet brands in a given price range to be the same. In this case, because perceived brand differences are not large, buyers may shop around to learn what is available but buy relatively quickly. They may respond primarily to a good price or purchase convenience.

After the purchase, consumers might experience *postpurchase dissonance* (after-sale discomfort) when they notice certain disadvantages of the purchased carpet brand or hear favorable things about brands not purchased. To counter such dissonance, the marketer’s after-sale communications should provide evidence and support to help consumers feel good about their brand choices.

### Habitual Buying Behavior

**Habitual buying behavior** occurs under conditions of low-consumer involvement and little significant brand difference. For example, take table salt. Consumers have little involvement in this product category—they simply go to the store and reach for a brand. If they keep reaching for the same brand, it is out of habit rather than strong brand loyalty. Consumers appear to have low involvement with most low-cost, frequently purchased products.

> Some purchases are simple and routine, even habitual. Others are far more complex—involving extensive information gathering and evaluation—and are subject to sometimes subtle influences. For example, think of all that goes into a new car buying decision.

This table outlines a framework for classifying consumer buying behavior based on two key dimensions: consumer involvement and perceived brand differences. High involvement, characterized by significant differences between brands, encompasses complex buying behavior, where consumers engage in extensive information gathering and evaluation. Conversely, low involvement, with few perceived brand differences, includes variety-seeking buying behavior, where consumers switch brands for novelty, and habitual buying behavior, where purchases are routine and require minimal cognitive effort. Dissonance-reducing buying behavior also falls under high involvement but is distinguished by a situation where consumers may still be highly involved but perceive fewer brand differences, leading to post-purchase reassurance. The structure is a 2x2 matrix, mapping involvement levels against brand differentiation to categorize these four distinct buying behavior types.

> Buying behavior varies greatly for different types of products. For example, someone buying a new car might undertake a full information-gathering and brand evaluation process.

> At the other extreme, for low-involvement products, consumers may simply select a familiar brand out of habit. For example, what brand of salt do you buy and why?
