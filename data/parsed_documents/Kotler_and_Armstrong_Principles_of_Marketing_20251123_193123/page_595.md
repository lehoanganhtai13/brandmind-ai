in specific local markets. Then it finds the best balance between standardizing its brands for global impact and adapting them to meet local needs and desires.

L’Oréal is as global as a company gets. With offices spread across 130 nations and more than half of its sales coming from markets outside Europe and North America, the company no longer has a clearly defined home market. L’Oréal’s well-known brands originated in a half-dozen or more different cultures, including French (L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Lancôme), American (Maybelline, Kiehl’s, SoftSheen-Carson, Ralph Lauren, Urban Decay, Clarisonic, Redken), British (The Body Shop), Italian (Giorgio Armani), and Japanese (Shu Uemura). With these and many other well-known brands, the master global marketer is the uncontested world leader in makeup, skin care, and hair coloring and second only to P&G in hair care.

## Because I’m Worth It

L’Oréal’s strategy of universalisation is tied to its mission—“beauty for all.” If there is one thing that L’Oréal has discovered about women worldwide, it is that they want to feel good about themselves. And how they feel is inherently connected to how they care for themselves and their appearance. This universal characteristic holds true regardless of ethnicity, culture, age, or socioeconomic status. For this reason, “beauty for all” has L’Oréal focused on providing the ultimate in luxury beauty for the masses.

While the Paris-based giant has been peddling cosmetics for more than a century, the relevance of its mission became more apparent than ever in the 1970s. The company launched Superior Preference hair color with an advertisement that presented a woman’s point of view and ended with four words—“Because I’m Worth It.” From the moment the ad hit, those words struck a chord with women. Here was a brand with a message about what a woman thought—about her self-confidence, her decisions, her style.

Originally just a tagline, those four words have transcended their intended purpose and have even become part of the social fabric. They have been written into global language, used by a woman for any situation where she wants to stand up for herself and proclaim her self-worth. Today, 80 percent of women worldwide recognize and respond to this phrase in a positive and powerful way. And today, “Because I’m Worth It” is translated into action every day by L’Oréal.

## Beauty from Multiple Perspectives

To achieve “beauty for all” globally, L’Oréal’s starts with a corps of highly multicultural managers. The company is famous for building global brand teams around managers who have deep backgrounds in several cultures. Unlike many global corporations that set up an international structure composed of autonomous subsidiaries, divisions, and management teams in different parts of the world, L’Oréal knew that such a structure would not provide the balance between standardization and adaptation that is critical in today’s cosmetics industry. Instead, the company built global teams around individual managers with deep backgrounds in multiple cultures, allowing them to switch easily among them.

Able to see things from multiple perspectives, a truly multicultural manager can think at any moment as if he or she were German, American, or Chinese—or all three at once. The Indian-American-French manager of a team that launched a men’s skin care line in Southeast Asia explains: 

> “I have a stock of references in different languages: English, Hindi, and French. I read books in three different languages, meet people from different countries, eat food from different [cultures], and so on. I cannot think about things one way.”

For example, a French-Irish-Cambodian manager working on skin care noticed that, in Europe, face creams tended to be either “tinted” (and considered as makeup) or “lifting” (and considered as skin care). But in Asia, many face creams combined the two traits. Recognizing the growing popularity of Asian beauty trends in Europe, this manager guided his team in developing a tinted cream with lifting effects for the French market, a product that proved to be highly successful. As the global environment has created a greater need for this type of knowledge integration across cultures, L’Oréal’s strategic use of multicultural managers provides built-in shortcuts. This management structure has given L’Oréal a critical competitive advantage in new product development.

## Diving Deep for Beauty

L’Oréal digs deep to understand what beauty means to consumers in different parts of the world. It outspends all major competitors on R&D, painstakingly researching beauty and personal care behaviors unique to specific locales. One of the goals of its global R&D efforts is to gain an in-depth understanding of the behaviors of women and men around the world with respect to beautifying and taking care of themselves. L’Oréal explains the need for this worldwide approach to beauty rituals:

> How many minutes does a Chinese woman devote to her morning beauty routine? How do people wash their hair in Bangkok? How many brush strokes does a Japanese woman or a French woman use to apply mascara? These beauty rituals, repeated thousands of times, are inherently cultural. Passed on by tradition, influenced by climate and by local living conditions, they strive to achieve an ideal of perfection that is different from one country and from one continent to the next. They provide an incredibly rich source of information for L’Oréal Research. Behind these rituals, there are physiological realities: fine, straight and short eyelashes cannot be made up the same way as thick, curled, and long lashes.

To facilitate this major R&D effort, L’Oréal has set up centers all over the world, developing a science of local observation it calls “geocosmetics.” This science is fueled with insight gained through in-home visits as well as observations made in “bathroom laboratories.” Equipped with high-tech gadgetry, these labs enable teams to study consumer behavior around the world.

L’Oréal’s R&D program produces very precise information about regional rituals of hygiene and beauty as well as local conditions and constraints that affect the use of products, such as humidity and temperature. These insights feed R&D teams in the process of creating products for local markets. Combined with insights from global locations, such products can be adapted for multiple markets.

For example, consider Elséve Total Reparação, a hair care line initially developed at L’Oréal’s labs in Rio de Janeiro to address specific hair problems described by Brazilian women. In Brazil, more than half of all women have long, dry, dull, and very curly hair, resulting from the humid Brazilian climate, exposure to the sun, frequent washing, and smoothing and straightening treatments. Elséve Total Reparação was an immediate hit in Brazil, and L’Oréal quickly rolled it out to other South American and Latin American markets. The company then tracked down other global locales with climate characteristics and hair care rituals similar to those faced by Brazilian women. Subsequently, L’Oréal launched the brand as Elséve Total Repair in numerous European, Indian, and other South East Asian markets, where consumers greeted it with similar enthusiasm.
