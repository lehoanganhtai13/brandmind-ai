# Marketing Performance Measures

HD’s product has been on the market for one year and management wants to assess its sales and profit performance. One way to assess this performance is to compute performance ratios derived from HD’s **profit-and-loss statement** (or **income statement** or **operating statement**).

Whereas the pro forma profit-and-loss statement shows *projected* financial performance, the statement given in **Table A2.2** shows HD’s *actual* financial performance based on actual sales, cost of goods sold, and expenses during the past year. By comparing the profit-and-loss statement from one period to the next, HD can gauge performance against goals, spot favorable or unfavorable trends, and take appropriate corrective action.

The profit-and-loss statement shows that HD lost $1 million rather than making the $12.5 million profit projected in the pro forma statement. Why? One obvious reason is that net sales fell $25 million short of estimated sales. Lower sales translated into lower variable costs associated with marketing the product. However, both fixed costs and the cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales exceeded expectations. Hence, the product’s contribution margin was 21% rather than the estimated 26%. That is, variable costs represented 79% of sales (55% for cost of goods sold, 10% for sales commissions, 10% for freight, and 4% for co-op allowances). Recall that contribution margin can be calculated by subtracting that fraction from one (1 − 0.79 = 0.21). Total fixed costs were $22 million, $2 million more than estimated. Thus, the sales that HD needed to break even given this cost structure can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Break-even sales} = \frac{\text{fixed costs}}{\text{contribution margin}} = \frac{\$22,000,000}{0.21} = \$104,761,905
$$

If HD had achieved another $5 million in sales, it would have earned a profit.

Although HD’s sales fell short of the forecasted sales, so did overall industry sales for this product. Overall industry sales were only $2.5 billion. That means that HD’s **market share** was 4% ($100 million ÷ $2.5 billion = 0.04 = 4%), which was higher than forecasted.

### Table A2.2  
**Profit-and-Loss Statement for the 12-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017**

This data presents a comparative income statement, detailing the breakdown of Net Sales into various expense categories to arrive at Net Profit Before Income Tax.  Net Sales of $100,000,000, representing 100%, are reduced by the Cost of Goods Sold ($55,000,000 or 55%), yielding a Gross Margin of $45,000,000 (45%). This Gross Margin is then further reduced by Marketing Expenses, totaling $39,000,000 (39%), which encompass Sales expenses, Promotion expenses, and Freight. Following this, General and Administrative Expenses, amounting to $7,000,000 (7%) and including Managerial salaries and expenses and Indirect overhead, are subtracted. The cumulative effect of these deductions results in a Net Profit Before Income Tax of -$1,000,000, a loss of 1% of Net Sales. The profit-and-loss statement provides the figures needed to compute some crucial **operating ratios**—the ratios of selected operating statement items to net sales.
