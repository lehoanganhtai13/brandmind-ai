# FIGURE 10.2  
This table outlines two distinct pricing strategies: Cost-based pricing and Value-based pricing. Cost-based pricing follows a linear progression, beginning with product design, followed by determining the associated costs, setting a price derived from these costs, and finally, persuading customers of the product's worth. In contrast, Value-based pricing adopts an inverted approach, starting with an assessment of customer needs and their perception of value, then establishing a target price aligned with this perceived value. Subsequently, it determines the costs that can be accommodated within this target price, and finally, designs the product to deliver the desired value at that predetermined price. The core difference lies in the starting point: cost-based pricing originates from internal cost considerations, while value-based pricing is driven by external customer perceptions and willingness to pay.

> Costs play an important role in setting prices. But like everything else in marketing, good pricing starts with the customer.

It’s important to remember that **“good value” is not the same as “low price.”** For example, some owners consider a luxurious Patek Philippe watch a real bargain, even at eye-popping prices ranging from $20,000 to $500,000:

Listen up here, because I’m about to tell you why a certain watch costing $20,000, or even $500,000, isn’t actually expensive but is in fact a tremendous value. Every Patek Philippe watch is handmade by Swiss watchmakers from the finest materials and can take more than a year to make. Still not convinced? Beyond keeping precise time, Patek Philippe watches are also good investments. They carry high prices but retain or even increase their value over time. Many models achieve a kind of cult status that makes them the most coveted timepieces on the planet.

But more important than just a means of telling time or a good investment is the sentimental and emotional value of possessing a Patek Philippe. Says the company’s president: “This is about passion. I mean—it really is a dream. Nobody needs a Patek.” These watches are unique possessions steeped in precious memories, making them treasured family assets. According to the company, “The purchase of a Patek Philippe is often related to a personal event—a professional success, a marriage, or the birth of a child—and offering it as a gift is the most eloquent expression of love or affection.” A Patek Philippe watch is made not to last just one lifetime but many. Says one ad: “You never actually own a Patek Philippe, you merely look after it for the next generation.” That makes it a real bargain, even at twice the price.

A company will often find it hard to measure the value customers attach to its product. For example, calculating the cost of ingredients in a meal at a fancy restaurant is relatively easy. But assigning value to other measures of satisfaction such as taste, environment, relaxation, conversation, and status is very hard. Such value is subjective; it varies both for different consumers and different situations.

Still, consumers will use these perceived values to evaluate a product’s price, so the company must work to measure them. Sometimes, companies ask consumers how much they would pay for a basic product and for each benefit added to the offer. Or a company might conduct experiments to test the perceived value of different product offers. According to an old Russian proverb, there are two fools in every market—one who asks too much and one who asks too little. If the seller charges more than the buyers’ perceived value, the company’s sales will suffer. If the seller charges less, its products will sell very well, but they will produce less revenue than they would if they were priced at the level of perceived value.

We now examine two types of value-based pricing: *good-value pricing* and *value-added pricing*.

## Good-Value Pricing

The Great Recession of 2008 to 2009 caused a fundamental and lasting shift in consumer attitudes toward price and quality. In response, many companies have changed their pricing The Mercedes CLA Class gives customers “The Art of Seduction.
