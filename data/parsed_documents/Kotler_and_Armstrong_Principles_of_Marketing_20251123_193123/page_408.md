# Growth of Direct, Online, Mobile, and Social Media Retailing

Home Depot is a very important customer to RPM, accounting for a significant share of its consumer sales. However, Home Depot’s sales of $83 billion are 18 times RPM’s sales of $4.6 billion. As a result, the giant retailer can, and often does, use this power to wring concessions from RPM and thousands of other smaller suppliers.24

Most consumers still make a majority of their purchases the old-fashioned way: They go to a store, find what they want, plunk down their cash or credit cards, and bring home the goods. However, consumers now have a broad array of nonstore alternatives, including direct and digital shopping via websites, mobiles apps, and social media. As we’ll discuss in Chapter 17, direct and digital marketing are currently the fastest-growing forms of marketing.

Today, thanks to advanced technologies, easier-to-use and enticing online sites and mobile apps, improved online services, and the increasing sophistication of search technologies, online retailing is thriving. In fact, although it currently accounts for only about 8 percent of total U.S. retail sales, online buying is growing at a much brisker pace than retail buying as a whole. Last year’s U.S. online retail sales grew 14 percent over the previous year versus a 2.2 percent increase in overall retail sales.25

Retailer online sites, mobile apps, and social media also influence a large amount of in-store buying. It’s estimated that more than half of total U.S. retail sales are either transacted directly or influenced by online research. And an estimated 15 percent of all online sales now take place on mobile devices. Retailers of all kinds rely on social media to engage their buyer communities. For example, whereas McDonald’s leads among retailers in Facebook Likes, Nordstrom is tops in Pinterest followers. Starbucks leads in Twitter followers. And Victoria’s Secret has the most YouTube subscribers and Instagram followers.26

The spurt in online, mobile, and social media retailing is both a blessing and a curse to store retailers. Although it gives them new channels for engaging and selling to customers, it also creates more competition from online-only retailers. Many shoppers now check out merchandise at physical-store showrooms but then buy it online using a computer or mobile device, sometimes while in the store—a process called **showrooming.** These days, 90 percent of smartphone-carrying shoppers use their phones while shopping in stores. And as many as half of all shoppers who buy products online check them out first at a traditional store.27 Store retailers such as Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Toys“R”Us have been hit hard by showrooming.

Today, however, many store retailers are developing effective strategies to counter showrooming. Others are even embracing it as an opportunity to highlight the advantages of shopping in stores versus online-only retailers. The flip side of showrooming is *webrooming,* by which consumers first check out merchandise online, then buy it in a store. The key for store retailers is to convert showrooming shoppers into buyers when they visit the store.

# The Need for Omni-Channel Retailing

The boundaries between in-store and online retailing are rapidly blurring. For most customers, it’s no longer a matter of deciding whether to shop in a store *or* to shop online. The internet and digital devices have spawned a whole new breed of shopper and way of shopping. Today’s omni-channel buyers shift seamlessly across online and in-store channels throughout the buying process. They’ve gotten used to researching and buying anywhere, anytime—whether it’s in the store, online, on the go, or even online while in the store. To meet the needs of these omni-channel buyers, store retailers must master *omni-channel retailing,* integrating store and online channels into a single shopper experience (see Real Marketing 13.2).
