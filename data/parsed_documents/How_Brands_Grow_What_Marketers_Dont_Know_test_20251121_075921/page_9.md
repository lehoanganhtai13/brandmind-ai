Table 5.6 shows that the demographic breakdown fluctuates across Yorkie varieties, partly due to random sampling variation, but the obvious pattern is that a lot of women buy Yorkie – they make up about half of its customer base.

And now a more serious example…

Table 5.4 showed that, like other categories, there is little difference in the user profile for different credit cards. But one financial institution said, “Our brand is different”, and they seemed to have a case. This Australian credit card gives a small donation to a local maternity hospital for every dollar that users spend on the card. It even features a picture of a baby on the card itself.

It is obvious that this card would have a customer base skewed towards women. Not just because the card would appeal to women but also because it wouldn’t appeal to groups like young men (and maybe even young women). The marketing department told us this must be the case. But then the data came in (see Table 5.7). Cardholders are ever slightly more likely to be female than non-cardholders; but they are also more likely to be single and no more likely to have children. It appears that you don’t have to be a mother to value this credit card.

**Table 5.7:** Cardholds c.f. non-cardholders  



This data presents a comparative analysis of cardholder and non-cardholder customer demographics, focusing on gender and household composition.  Cardholders are predominantly female (63%) compared to males (37%), while non-cardholders show a slightly higher male proportion (42%) versus females (58%).  Regarding household structure, both groups exhibit similar patterns: a majority of cardholders (52%) and non-cardholders (53%) belong to families with children. Couples without children represent a significant segment for both, at 32% for cardholders and 34% for non-cardholders. Single individuals constitute a smaller portion, 15% of cardholders and 12% of non-cardholders, with a minimal 'Other' category for both. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences and similarities across two customer segments based on demographic attributes.
