As you can see, a high proportion of each brand’s buyers also bought Coca-Cola, and this proportion varies little between the different brands – it’s always about two-thirds of their customer base³⁴. This empirical evidence counters Kotler’s idea that individual brands sell to distinctly different segments of buyers – brands share customers. Several of the brands are even marketed by the Coca-Cola company; these brands share their customers with Coca-Cola as much as rival company’s brands do.

Customer-sharing data gives insight into who competes against whom. If brands are close rivals, then they should be in the repertoires of the same people, that is, they share customers ³⁵. Logically, brands that are direct competitors within a product category should show higher levels of sharing, and brands that target different segments should share fewer customers.

# Duplication of purchase analysis

The extraordinary fact about the sharing analysis is not that Pepsi buyers also buy Coca-Cola (although this surprises some people), but that each brand shares a near identical proportion of its customer base with Coca-Cola.

The exact degree of sharing depends on the period of analysis. If it is long enough, then nearly all of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola, whereas over a very short time period a smaller proportion of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola. However, the length of time affects all brands equally, so it doesn’t affect inter-brand comparisons. Irrespective of the time period, each brand of soft drink shares a similar proportion of its consumers with Coca-Cola.

This suggests that all the brands compete *equally closely* with Coca-Cola, and that none of them sell to special discrete segments of buyers. Perhaps this is because Coca-Cola is so large. Perhaps no soft drink brand can get away from competing with Coke. But how do brands compete with less ubiquitous brands? Let’s now expand the analysis to consider all brands in a category.

A ‘duplication of purchase’ table³⁶ shows the degree to which brands within a category share their buyers with each of the other brands in the category (i.e. what proportion of their customers also bought another particular brand during the period). Table 6.2 is a duplication of purchase table with no data.

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on cross-buying patterns. It illustrates that each brand (A, B, C, and D) is exclusively purchased by its own respective buyers, with 100% of buyers of brand A also buying brand A, and similarly for brands B, C, and D. The structure is comparative, highlighting the self-contained purchasing base for each individual brand. There is no indication of cross-purchasing between different brands; for instance, buyers of brand A do not also purchase brands B, C, or D, and vice versa. The table effectively demonstrates a scenario where brand loyalty or distinct market segmentation prevents customers from purchasing multiple brands within this observed set.
