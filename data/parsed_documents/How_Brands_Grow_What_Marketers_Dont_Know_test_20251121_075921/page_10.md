# I love my Mum (and you love yours)

What about differences in how a brand’s buyers perceive the world? As previously explained, a brand’s buyers hold much the same values as buyers of other brands (see Table 5.8); but what about the buyer’s attitudes towards your brand?

**Table 5.8:** Percentage point deviations from the brand norm: values held by brand users

This data presents a comparative analysis of six credit card brands across five distinct attitudinal statements. The structure is comparative, with each row representing a credit card brand and each column representing a specific attitude, quantified by a numerical score. The attitudes measured include "Children should express themselves freely," "I am happy with my standard of living," "I can’t bear untidiness," "I try to keep up with technology," and "I always look for special offers." Scores range from -4 to 2, indicating varying degrees of agreement or disagreement with each statement for each brand's customer base. For instance, Barclaycard Visa customers show neutral or negative scores across most attitudes, while Access Lloyds customers exhibit consistently positive scores, suggesting a strong alignment with all measured attitudes. Bank of Scotland Visa customers show a strong positive correlation with "Children should express themselves freely" and "I am happy with my standard of living," and a moderate positive correlation with "I try to keep up with technology." TSB Trust card customers display a notable positive score for "I always look for special offers" and "I can’t bear untidiness," contrasted with a strong negative score for "I try to keep up with technology."

There is one obvious way that buyers of one brand vary from another: their brand buying. This affects their attitude to brands and their brand knowledge. People tend to have opinions about the brands they buy, and not think or know much about brands they don’t use. Behaviour is a powerful driver of awareness, perceptions and attitudes – something that both academic and market researchers have a tendency to forget.³⁰

Attitudes reflect how much a buyer buys the brand, that is, they reflect loyalty. We know that loyalty metrics don’t vary a lot between brands. Consequently, the buyers of brand A have the same opinion of brand A as buyers of brand B have of brand B. I call this the ‘my mum’ phenomenon: my own mother is the best mum in the world, she’s lovely, but she can also be rather annoying sometimes. Does that sound like your mum?

Another lovely example of this was a global survey of tourists conducted by
