The 100% cells are a brand’s level of customer overlap with itself, which logically must always be 100%. In terms of the presentation of the data, it’s good practice to blank out these cells because they are not needed.

Duplication of purchase tables refer to a particular time period, for example, the people during the year who bought brand A who also bought brand B. Note that a buyer of brand A needs to only make one purchase of brand B to be counted. Consequently, duplication analyses that apply to very long periods can be misleading, because every brand may show very high levels of sharing with every other brand, which obscures who competes more or less closely. At the other end of the time spectrum, in very short time periods there is often no duplication (because many customers have only bought the category once), which is also misleading. The analyst should choose a period long enough to capture a degree of repeated purchase, that is, a period long enough to allow most people to have bought multiple brands. Readers of duplication tables need to note that they refer to a particular period, there is never an absolute metric; one can’t simply say, ‘70% of Pepsi buyers drink Coke’ – it’s 70% **in a year**.

# The duplication of purchase law

Let’s look at a duplication of purchase table for ice-cream brands (see Table 6.3).

**Table 6.3:** Duplication of purchase – ice-cream, 2005

This data presents a cross-purchase matrix illustrating the percentage of buyers of specific ice cream brands who also purchased other brands. The structure is comparative, with rows indicating the primary brand purchased and columns showing the percentage of those buyers who also bought a secondary brand. For instance, buyers of Carte D'Or (Walls) also purchased Walls Dessert at a 15% rate, Ben & Jerry's at 8%, Häagen Dazs at 8%, Nestle at 9%, Walls at 5%, and Mars at 4%. Similarly, buyers of Walls Dessert showed a 34% cross-purchase rate with Carte D'Or, 7% with Ben & Jerry's, and so on. The diagonal is marked with a hyphen, indicating no cross-purchase within the same brand. The table highlights inter-brand purchasing behaviors, revealing which brands are frequently bought together by consumers.
