  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on cross-buying patterns. It illustrates that each brand (A, B, C, and D) is exclusively purchased by its own respective buyers, with 100% of buyers of brand A also buying brand A, and similarly for brands B, C, and D. The structure is comparative, highlighting the self-contained purchasing base for each individual brand. There is no indication of cross-purchasing between different brands; for instance, buyers of brand A do not also purchase brands B, C, or D, and vice versa. The table effectively demonstrates a scenario where brand loyalty or distinct market segmentation prevents customers from purchasing multiple brands within this observed set.",
