  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two distinct world views of advertising, contrasting a \"Past World View\" with a \"New World View.\" The Past World View emphasizes core advertising functions such as Positioning, Message Comprehension, Unique Selling Propositions, Persuasion, Teaching, and Campaign Bursts. In contrast, the New World View reframes these concepts with a focus on Salience, Getting Noticed and Emotional Response, Relevant Associations, Refreshing and Building Memory Structures, Reaching, and Continuous Presence. This suggests a shift from a product-centric, functional approach to a more consumer-centric, perception-driven understanding of advertising's role and impact. The structure is comparative, highlighting the evolution of advertising strategy and objectives.",
