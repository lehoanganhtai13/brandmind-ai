  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of cardholder and non-cardholder customer demographics, focusing on gender and household composition.  Cardholders are predominantly female (63%) compared to males (37%), while non-cardholders show a slightly higher male proportion (42%) versus females (58%).  Regarding household structure, both groups exhibit similar patterns: a majority of cardholders (52%) and non-cardholders (53%) belong to families with children. Couples without children represent a significant segment for both, at 32% for cardholders and 34% for non-cardholders. Single individuals constitute a smaller portion, 15% of cardholders and 12% of non-cardholders, with a minimal 'Other' category for both. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences and similarities across two customer segments based on demographic attributes.",
