  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of product categories across four metrics: Demo, Media, Values, and Average. The structure is a simple listing of product categories, each with associated numerical values for these metrics. The values range from 1 to 6, with a clear overall average for each metric indicated at the bottom. Notably, \"Cigarettes\" shows the highest values across Demo, Media, and Values, resulting in the highest individual Average. Many other categories, such as \"Cat food,\" \"Mints,\" and \"Toothbrushes,\" exhibit lower but consistent values across the metrics. The data appears to be a quantitative assessment of these categories, possibly related to consumer behavior, advertising reach, or perceived importance, with \"Cigarettes\" standing out as a distinct outlier in terms of its reported values.",
