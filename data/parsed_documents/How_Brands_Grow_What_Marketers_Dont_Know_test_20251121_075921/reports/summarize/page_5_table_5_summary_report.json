  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a distribution of buyers based on the number of purchases made, illustrating a comparative structure. The primary components are the \"Number of purchases,\" ranging from zero to twenty or more, and the corresponding \"Buyers (%)\" who fall into each purchase category. The key relationship depicted is the inverse correlation between the number of purchases and the percentage of buyers, with a significant majority of buyers making a small number of purchases. Specifically, 11% of buyers made zero purchases, while 18% made one purchase, and 14% made two purchases. As the number of purchases increases, the percentage of buyers generally decreases, reaching a low of 1% for buyers making between 12 and 19 purchases. A small fraction, 1%, of buyers made 20 or more purchases, indicating a long tail of high-volume customers.",
