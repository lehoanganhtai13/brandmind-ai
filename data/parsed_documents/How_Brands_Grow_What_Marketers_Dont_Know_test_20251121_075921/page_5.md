they simply move from one weight of this distribution to another. Put another way, changes in sales come from buying propensities changing across the entire market – from heavy to light and non-buyers of the brand. Every buyer group (or weight) changes²⁵. When marketing is successful in delivering more sales and market share, it does so by giving the brand more heavy buyers, more medium buyers and a lot more light buyers. This means that for maintenance or growth, a brand’s marketing has to somehow, at least over time, reach all the buyers in a category.

Even if a brand gained 100% market share, which would mean it had 100% penetration and perfect loyalty, it would still have many light buyers because category buying also shows a skewed distribution. For example, Figure 4.4 shows the distribution of buying for the toothpaste category - one where we would hope there was rather regular buying. Yet is seems rather rare for a UK household to buy toothpaste more than six times a year. Most bought three times or less, indeed 11% did not buy toothpaste that year.

This data presents a distribution of buyers based on the number of purchases made, illustrating a comparative structure. The primary components are the "Number of purchases," ranging from zero to twenty or more, and the corresponding "Buyers (%)" who fall into each purchase category. The key relationship depicted is the inverse correlation between the number of purchases and the percentage of buyers, with a significant majority of buyers making a small number of purchases. Specifically, 11% of buyers made zero purchases, while 18% made one purchase, and 14% made two purchases. As the number of purchases increases, the percentage of buyers generally decreases, reaching a low of 1% for buyers making between 12 and 19 purchases. A small fraction, 1%, of buyers made 20 or more purchases, indicating a long tail of high-volume customers.

Of course, for an individual toothpaste brand these figures are even lighter, less frequent, because a brand’s users also buy other brands. See Figure 4.5 which shows the buying distribution for Colgate in the same market in the same year. Now 86% of shoppers bought three times or less, with 59% not buying Colgate that year.
