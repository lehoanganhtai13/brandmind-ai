The categories are ranked by size of the deviation, but as you can see there isn’t great variation between them. In each of these categories the typical deviation is small, apart from some rather obvious differences, such as:

* Scottish newspapers have more readers in Scotland than the average newspaper brand.
* Children’s television channels have more children viewers than the average television channel (though still almost half the viewers of these channels are adults).
* Very expensive brands have fewer poor people in their customer base.

Large exceptions are worthy of management attention, but of course they are undoubtedly well known (e.g. that’s why we use names like ‘children’s channels’).

# Extreme targeting

Maybe the real-world looks like this because marketers haven’t targeted special audiences. Maybe if they tried harder reality might match textbook theory? But the two following case studies suggest that even when marketers try, in very overt ways, to target special audiences, they end up with normal-looking customer bases (so long as they are successful in winning market share). By definition, the more market share they gain, the more normal their customer base becomes.²⁶
