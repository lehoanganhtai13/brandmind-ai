be tempting to ignore them. But when these light buyers deliver around half your sales, do you still want to ignore them? Marketing’s Pareto law is important, but the ratio isn’t 80/20 and the traditional implications are incorrect.

Normally the Pareto law is used to justify a strategy that concentrates on the brand’s heaviest buyers (e.g. Koch 1999). The (misplaced) logic being that these buyers are worth more, and marketers can justify spending more per buyer. But making them the dominant focus of marketing activity is not wise. Ignoring light and non-buyers of a brand is no recipe for growth (as we saw in the Chapters 2 and 3). Besides the logic is flawed, what matters is not so much the weight of a buyer as their propensity to change in reaction to marketing. And how many of these customers there are; what they are worth in total?

# Buyers aren’t always what they seem

The logic of targeting heavy buyers is undermined further by the fact that the *future* sales potential of individuals is different than their current buying suggests. This is true even when you have perfectly reliable sales data on your individual buyers, and even when there is no real change in their behaviour. Non-buyers and light buyers are heavier buyers than you think, and heavy buyers are lighter. This is neatly illustrated in a two-year analysis of a leading brand of tomato sauce in the US using IRI and Nielsen panel data (Anschuetz 2002). Although the brand was stationary (not growing or losing sales volume), 14% of its sales came from households that did not buy it at all in the year before; in other words, from people who the brand’s marketing team would have considered were non-buyers of the brand. While the small group (9%) of heavy buying households delivered 34% of volume, this was less than the 43% they delivered in Year 1. Table 4.4 shows that over time the heavier buyers get lighter, and the non-buyers and light buyers get heavier.

The way the lightest buyers became heavier and the heaviest buyers became lighter is a ‘regression to the mean’ phenomenon. This law (which we’ll call ‘the law of buyer moderation’)²⁴ applies to all brands and can be precisely predicted from the known distribution of buying frequencies.

**Table 4.4: Sales volumes from different buyer groups one year later**



This data presents a comparative analysis of buyer groups, detailing their proportion of the total sample, annual buying frequency, and their representation of brand sales volume across two years. The buyer groups are categorized as Non-buyers, Light buyers, Moderate buyers, and Heavy buyers, constituting 44%, 22%, 25%, and 9% of the sample, respectively. Buying frequency ranges from zero for Non-buyers to five or more purchases annually for Heavy buyers. In Year 1, Moderate and Heavy buyers each represented 43% of brand sales volume, with Light buyers at 14% and Non-buyers at 0%. By Year 2, the sales volume representation shifted, with Non-buyers increasing to 14%, Light buyers to 16%, Moderate buyers decreasing to 36%, and Heavy buyers to 34%. This structure highlights a shift in sales volume contribution across buyer segments over time, with a notable increase from previously non-purchasing or infrequent buyers.
