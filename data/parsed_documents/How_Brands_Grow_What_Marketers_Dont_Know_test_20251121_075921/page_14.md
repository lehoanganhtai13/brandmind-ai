# Table 12.3: The new advertising model

This table outlines two distinct world views of advertising, contrasting a "Past World View" with a "New World View." The Past World View emphasizes core advertising functions such as Positioning, Message Comprehension, Unique Selling Propositions, Persuasion, Teaching, and Campaign Bursts. In contrast, the New World View reframes these concepts with a focus on Salience, Getting Noticed and Emotional Response, Relevant Associations, Refreshing and Building Memory Structures, Reaching, and Continuous Presence. This suggests a shift from a product-centric, functional approach to a more consumer-centric, perception-driven understanding of advertising's role and impact. The structure is comparative, highlighting the evolution of advertising strategy and objectives.

This theory has to be a new replacement for the twentieth century Kotlerian view of marketing. According to Kotler, competition for sales is about creating differentiated brands that carve off sections of market share by addressing the heterogeneity between consumers. Thus, competing brands sell to different types of consumers; brands have substantially different images; and brand loyalty varies considerably. This view also holds that many brands are niche brands; and that considerable growth is possible by becoming even more niche and selling more to a brand’s most loyal customers.

This worldview was partly responsible for the very large (and low return) investments in loyalty programs and customer relationship management (CRM) that occurred towards the end of the twentieth century. 81 On a less visible level, this worldview was also responsible for millions of misguided and productivity-sapping marketing plans. Some marketers got lucky and succeeded in spite of their plan ⁸², through implementation ‘mistakes’ or from competitors getting it even more wrong. But many misplaced plans did their bit to erode their brand’s customer franchise.

However, this twentieth century view of marketing is not completely wrong. It just describes a limited part of the competition for sales. It more aptly describes the competition between product categories than the competition between brands within a category (yet, even in this case it is often an exaggeration). The Kotlerian view doesn’t fit the facts of branded competition; it fails the most basic test of scientific theories: it does not lead to empirical laws. In some cases, it even clashes with these empirical laws (i.e. it predicts different patterns). For example, strong differentiation and differences in brand user profiles would destroy the laws of double jeopardy and duplication of purchase. Yet in the real world we find only minor deviations from these laws. The Kotlerian worldview is not the opposite of reality, but it is a very poor representation of it. It’s similar to the view that the world is flat – it isn’t, though there are flat-ish parts (much of Australia, for instance).
