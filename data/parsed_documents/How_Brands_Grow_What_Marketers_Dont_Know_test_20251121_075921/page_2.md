This table outlines the Colgate consumer base, categorizing it into three distinct segments based on purchasing behavior. The largest segment comprises Switchers, accounting for 46% of consumers, indicating a tendency to move between brands. Loyals represent a significant portion at 38%, suggesting a strong preference for Colgate. The smallest segment consists of One-time buyers, making up 16% of the consumer base, implying infrequent or trial purchases. This data, sourced from Spaeth & Hess in 1989, presents a comparative structure of Colgate's customer demographics, highlighting the relative sizes of these behavioral groups.

This table outlines the consumer base of Crest, categorizing it into three distinct segments based on purchasing behavior. The largest segment comprises "Switchers," accounting for 68% of the consumer base, indicating a tendency to choose different brands. "Loyals," representing 21%, demonstrate consistent brand preference. The smallest segment is "One time buyers" at 11%, suggesting infrequent or trial purchases. This data presents a comparative structure, highlighting the relative proportions of these consumer types within Crest's market. The information is sourced from Spaeth & Hess, 1989.

These charts decompose the sales volume of each rival brand according to the recent repeat-buying behaviour of their consumers.

The percentage of Colgate’s sales that came from loyal customers is almost half that of Crest’s loyals (‘loyals’ being people who bought the brand for the majority of their toothpaste purchasing during the analysis period). Colgate’s sales come much more from ‘switchers’ – people who bought Colgate at least once in the analysis period, although most of their buying was of other brands.
