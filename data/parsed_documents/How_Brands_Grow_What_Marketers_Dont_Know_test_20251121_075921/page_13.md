# Chapter 12:  
## Mental and Physical Availability

Byron Sharp

----

The key marketing task is to make a brand always easy to buy for every buyer; this requires building mental and physical availability. Everything else is secondary. Brands largely compete in terms of physical and mental (brand salience) availability. Even product innovation largely works, when it works, through enhancing mental availability and gaining further distribution. Building mental availability requires reach, distinctiveness (clear branding) and consistency. The brand is seen/noticed, recognised and recalled more often. Building physical availability requires breadth and depth of distribution in space and in time. Together, mental and physical availability make a brand easier to buy for more people, in more situations.

## A new theory of competition for sales

We have a collection of scientific laws of marketing – law-like patterns that hold very widely and under known conditions (see the complete list of marketing laws on pages vii-viii). These laws can be used to predict and explain marketing patterns, but it would also be useful to have a theory that could weave these laws into a memorable, overarching story that can guide our marketing strategy.

**Table 12.1: The new consumer behavior model**

This table outlines a shift in understanding consumer behavior, moving from a "Past World View" to a "New World View." The core change is the relationship between attitude and behavior, with the past view positing that attitude drives behavior, while the new view suggests behavior drives attitude. This impacts the categorization of consumers: "Brand Loyals" and "Deeply Committed Buyers" in the past are re-envisioned as "Loyal Switchers" in the new paradigm. Similarly, "Brand Switchers" are also categorized as "Loyal Switchers." The concept of "Involvement" in the past is replaced by "Heuristics" in the new view, and "Rational Involved Viewers" become "Emotional Distracted Viewers." This represents a transition from a cognitively driven model of consumer decision-making to one that emphasizes behavioral patterns and cognitive shortcuts.

**Table 12.2: The new brand performance model**



This table outlines a shift in brand performance strategy, contrasting a "Past World View" with a "New World View." The core structure is comparative, highlighting divergent approaches across several key areas. In terms of growth, the past focused on "Targeting Brand Loyals," whereas the new view emphasizes "Growth Through Penetration." Brand metrics have evolved from "Unpredictable Confusing Brand Metrics" to "Predictable Meaningful Brand Metrics." The role of price promotions has shifted from winning new customers to engaging "Existing Loyal Customers." Marketing strategies have moved from "Target Marketing" to "Sophisticated Mass Marketing." Competitive approaches have transitioned from "We Compete on Positioning" to "Heuristics," and the concept of "Differentiation" has been redefined as "Distinctiveness."
