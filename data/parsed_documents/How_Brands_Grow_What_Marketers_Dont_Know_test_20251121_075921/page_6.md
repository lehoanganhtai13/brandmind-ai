significance. No sensible marketer would alter their marketing strategy based on this data. Also, around 40% of every brand’s customer base is aged between 35 and 54 years old; this percentage is 47% for Access NatWest – but again, this is a small difference that has no practical significance.

**Table 5.4:** Demographic profiles of credit card brands, UK  

This table presents a comparative analysis of demographic data, specifically gender and age distribution, across various credit card brands. The data is structured to show the percentage of male and female cardholders for each brand, alongside the percentage distribution across distinct age groups ranging from 15-19 years to 65+ years. Brands analyzed include Barclaycard Visa, TSB Trust card, Access NatWest, Access Midlands, Barclays MasterCard, Access Lloyds, Bank of Scotland Visa, Midland Visa, TSB MasterCard, and Co-op Bank Visa. An "Average brand" row synthesizes the overall demographic profile. The structure facilitates a direct comparison of how gender and age demographics vary or align among these different credit card offerings, highlighting potential target market segments or user bases for each.

These sorts of minor difference – some simply due to random sampling variation – were the norm in all the research studies. This is illustrated in Table 5.5, which shows the average size of the average deviation from the brand norm in more than 40 product/service categories summarised by Dr Rachel Kennedy (see Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000).

**Table 5.5:** Deviation from the brand norm  



This data presents a comparative analysis of product categories across four metrics: Demo, Media, Values, and Average. The structure is a simple listing of product categories, each with associated numerical values for these metrics. The values range from 1 to 6, with a clear overall average for each metric indicated at the bottom. Notably, "Cigarettes" shows the highest values across Demo, Media, and Values, resulting in the highest individual Average. Many other categories, such as "Cat food," "Mints," and "Toothbrushes," exhibit lower but consistent values across the metrics. The data appears to be a quantitative assessment of these categories, possibly related to consumer behavior, advertising reach, or perceived importance, with "Cigarettes" standing out as a distinct outlier in terms of its reported values.
