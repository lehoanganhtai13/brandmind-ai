# A Modern Marketing System



This diagram illustrates the key players and forces within a market environment. At the core are **Suppliers**, encompassing both individual **Companies** and their **Competitors**. These suppliers interact with **Marketing intermediaries**, who facilitate the flow of goods and services. The ultimate destination for these offerings is the **Final consumers**. Surrounding and influencing all these entities are **Major environmental forces**, which exert a broad impact on the entire market ecosystem. The structure suggests a flow from suppliers through intermediaries to consumers, all operating within a dynamic environmental context.



> Each party in the system adds value. Walmart cannot fulfill its promise of low prices unless its suppliers provide low costs. Ford cannot deliver a high-quality car-ownership experience unless its dealers provide outstanding service.

> Arrows represent relationships that must be developed and managed to create customer value and profitable customer relationships.

Figure 1.2 shows the main elements in a marketing system. Marketing involves serving a market of final consumers in the face of competitors. The company and competitors research the market and interact with consumers to understand their needs. Then they create and exchange market offerings, messages, and other marketing content with consumers, either directly or through marketing intermediaries. Each party in the system is affected by major environmental forces (demographic, economic, natural, technological, political, and social/cultural).

Each party in the system adds value for the next level. The arrows represent relationships that must be developed and managed. Thus, a company’s success at engaging customers and building profitable relationships depends not only on its own actions but also on how well the entire system serves the needs of final consumers. Walmart cannot fulfill its promise of low prices unless its suppliers provide merchandise at low costs. And Ford cannot deliver a high-quality car-ownership experience unless its dealers provide outstanding sales and service.

> **Author Comment:** Once a company fully understands its consumers and the marketplace, it must decide which customers it will serve and how it will bring them value.

## Designing a Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy and Plan

### Customer Value–Driven Marketing Strategy

Once it fully understands consumers and the marketplace, marketing management can design a customer value–driven marketing strategy. We define **marketing management** as the art and science of choosing target markets and building profitable relationships with them. The marketing manager’s aim is to engage, keep, and grow target customers by creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value.

To design a winning marketing strategy, the marketing manager must answer two important questions: *What customers will we serve (what’s our target market)?* and *How can we serve these customers best (what’s our value proposition)?* We will discuss these marketing strategy concepts briefly here and then look at them in more detail in Chapters 2 and 7.

### Selecting Customers to Serve

The company must first decide *whom* it will serve. It does this by dividing the market into segments of customers (*market segmentation*) and selecting which segments it will go after (*target marketing*). Some people think of marketing management as finding as many customers as possible and increasing demand. But marketing managers know that they cannot serve all customers in every way. By trying to serve all customers, they may not serve any customers well. Instead, the company wants to select only customers that it can serve well and profitably. For example, Nordstrom profitably targets affluent professionals; Dollar General profitably targets families with more modest means.

Ultimately, marketing managers must decide which customers they want to target and on the level, timing, and nature of their demand. Simply put, marketing management is *customer management* and *demand management*.
