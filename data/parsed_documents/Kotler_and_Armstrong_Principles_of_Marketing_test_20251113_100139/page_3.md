# An Expanded Model of the Marketing Process



This diagram outlines a five-stage marketing process focused on creating and capturing customer value. The initial stage involves understanding the marketplace and customer needs, achieved through researching customers and managing marketing information and data. This understanding then informs the design of a customer value-driven marketing strategy. Subsequently, an integrated marketing program is constructed to deliver superior value to customers. The fourth stage focuses on engaging customers, building profitable relationships, and creating customer delight. Throughout these stages, the overarching goal is to capture value from customers in return, ultimately leading to profits and the creation of customer equity. This represents a cyclical, customer-centric approach to marketing strategy and execution.

This table outlines a two-stage strategic marketing process. The initial stage involves "Select customers to serve," which encompasses the critical activities of "market segmentation" to identify distinct customer groups and "targeting" to choose which of these segments to pursue. Following this customer selection, the second stage focuses on "Decide on a value proposition." This stage includes "differentiation," the process of creating a unique offering that stands out from competitors, and "positioning," which involves establishing a clear and desirable place for the offering in the minds of the target customers. The overall structure represents a sequential, decision-driven framework for developing a market strategy.

This table outlines the four core marketing management functions, presented as distinct but interconnected pillars for building a successful brand and delivering value. These functions are: Product and service design, focused on establishing strong brands; Pricing, aimed at creating tangible value for customers; Distribution, responsible for effectively managing both demand and the associated supply chains; and Promotion, dedicated to clearly communicating the value proposition to the target audience. Together, these elements form a comprehensive framework for bringing products and services to market and fostering customer engagement.

This table outlines two distinct but related relationship management strategies. Customer relationship management focuses on cultivating engagement and fostering robust connections with a select customer base. Concurrently, partner relationship management addresses the development of strong alliances with marketing partners. Both strategies emphasize the importance of building and maintaining strong relationships, albeit with different stakeholder groups: customers and marketing partners. The overarching structure appears to be a comparative overview of distinct relationship management approaches within a business context.

This table outlines three distinct, yet potentially interconnected, strategic pillars for an organization. The first pillar, "Harness marketing technology," focuses on leveraging technological advancements to optimize marketing efforts, likely encompassing areas such as digital marketing, data analytics, and customer relationship management. The second pillar, "Manage global markets," addresses the complexities of operating and expanding across international territories, implying strategies for market entry, localization, and international logistics. The third pillar, "Ensure environmental and social responsibility," highlights a commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices, suggesting initiatives related to corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental impact reduction, and ethical sourcing. These three areas represent key functional domains that an organization must strategically address to achieve comprehensive success.



> This expanded version of Figure 1.1 at the beginning of the chapter provides a good road map for the rest of the text. The underlying concept of the entire text is that marketing creates value for customers in order to capture value from customers in return.

The first four steps of the marketing process focus on creating value for customers. The company first gains a full understanding of the marketplace by researching customer needs and managing marketing information. It then designs a customer-driven marketing strategy based on the answers to two simple questions. The first question is “What consumers will we serve?” (market segmentation and targeting). Good marketing companies know that they cannot serve all customers in every way. Instead, they need to focus their resources on the customers they can serve best and most profitably. The second marketing strategy question is “How can we best serve targeted customers?” (differentiation and positioning). Here, the marketer outlines a value proposition that spells out what values the company will deliver to win target customers.

With its marketing strategy chosen, the company now constructs an integrated marketing program—consisting of a blend of the four marketing mix elements, the four Ps—that transforms the marketing strategy into real value for customers. The company develops product offers and creates strong brand identities for them. It prices these offers to create real customer value and distributes the offers to make them available to target consumers. Finally, the company designs promotion programs that engage target customers, communicate the value proposition, and persuade customers to act on the market offering.

Perhaps the most important step in the marketing process involves building value-laden, profitable relationships with target customers. Throughout the process, marketers practice customer relationship management to create customer satisfaction and delight. They engage customers in the process of creating brand conversations, experiences, and community. In creating customer value and relationships, however, the company cannot go it alone. It must work closely with marketing partners both inside the company and throughout its marketing system. Thus, beyond practicing good customer relationship
