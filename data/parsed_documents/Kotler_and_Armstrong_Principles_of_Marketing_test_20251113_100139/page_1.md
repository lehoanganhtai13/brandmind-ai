# Defining Marketing and the Marketing Process

## FIGURE 1.1  
**The Marketing Process: Creating and Capturing Customer Value**



This table outlines a five-step marketing process, structured around two overarching goals: creating value for customers and capturing value from them. The process begins with understanding the marketplace and customer needs and wants. This foundational step informs the design of a customer value-driven marketing strategy. Subsequently, an integrated marketing program is constructed to deliver superior value to customers. The fourth step involves engaging customers, building profitable relationships, and creating customer delight. Finally, the process culminates in capturing value from customers, which translates into profits and the creation of customer equity. This represents a cyclical, customer-centric approach to marketing.



> This important figure shows marketing in a nutshell. By creating value *for* customers, marketers capture value *from* customers in return. This five-step process forms the marketing framework for the rest of the chapter and the remainder of the text.

> **Author Comment:** Marketing is all about creating value for customers. So, as the first step in the marketing process, the company must fully understand customers and the marketplace.

## Understanding the Marketplace and Customer Needs

As a first step, marketers need to understand customer needs and wants and the marketplace in which they operate. We examine five core customer and marketplace concepts:  
(1) *needs, wants, and demands*;  
(2) *market offerings* (products, services, and experiences);  
(3) *value and satisfaction*;  
(4) *exchanges and relationships*; and  
(5) *markets*.

States of felt deprivation.

### Wants

The form human needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality.

### Demands

Human wants that are backed by buying power.

## Customer Needs, Wants, and Demands

The most basic concept underlying marketing is that of human needs. Human **needs** are states of felt deprivation. They include basic *physical* needs for food, clothing, warmth, and safety; *social* needs for belonging and affection; and *individual* needs for knowledge and self-expression. Marketers did not create these needs; they are a basic part of the human makeup.

**Wants** are the form human needs take as they are shaped by culture and individual personality. An American needs food but *wants* a Big Mac, fries, and a soft drink. A person in Papua, New Guinea, needs food but *wants* taro, rice, yams, and pork. Wants are shaped by one’s society and are described in terms of objects that will satisfy those needs. When backed by buying power, wants become **demands**. Given their wants and resources, people demand products and services with benefits that add up to the most value and satisfaction.

Companies go to great lengths to learn about and understand customer needs, wants, and demands. They conduct consumer research, analyze mountains of customer data, and observe customers as they shop and interact, offline and online. People at all levels of the company—including top management—stay close to customers:

Blue dot Cornell likes nosing around stores and getting a real feel for what’s going on. It gives him “great, genuine feedback.” He and other Target executives even visit customers in their homes, opening closet doors and poking around in cupboards to understand their product choices and buying habits. Similarly, Boston Market CEO George Michel makes frequent visits to company restaurants, working in the dining room and engaging customers to learn about “the good, the bad, and the ugly.” He also stays connected by reading customer messages on the Boston Market website and has even cold-called customers for insights. “Being close to the customer is critically important,” says Michel. “I get to learn what they value, what they appreciate.”
