This data illustrates the fluctuations in monthly suicide rates relative to a specific event, likely a media story, as indicated by the column headers. The observed rates show a significant increase during the month of the story, with a difference of +1300 compared to usual rates. This surge is followed by a substantial, though diminished, increase in the month immediately after the story (+900). The elevated rates persist for a longer duration, with a smaller positive difference observed two months after (+100) and a slight increase three months after (+200). Conversely, the month preceding the story shows a decrease in suicide rates (-200), suggesting a potential temporal relationship where the event is associated with a temporary spike in suicide occurrences. The structure is comparative, highlighting deviations from a baseline over a defined time period.

**Author’s Note:** This evidence raises an important ethical issue. The suicides that follow these stories are excess deaths. After the initial spurt, the suicide rates do not drop below traditional levels but only return to those levels. Statistics such as these might well give pause to newspaper editors inclined to sensationalize suicide accounts, as those accounts are likely to lead to the deaths of scores of people. Data indicate that in addition to newspaper editors, TV broadcasters have cause for concern about the effects of the suicide stories they present. Whether they appear as news reports, information features, or fictional movies, these stories create an immediate cluster of self-inflicted deaths, with impressionable, imitation-prone teenagers being the most frequent victims (Bollen & Phillips, 1982; Gould & Shaffer, 1986; Phillips & Cartensen, 1986, 1988; Schmidtke & Hafner, 1988).

If the facts surrounding the Werther effect seem to you suspiciously like those surrounding the influence of suicide stories on air and traffic fatalities, the similarities have not been lost on Phillips either. In fact, he contends that all the excess deaths following a front-page suicide incident can be explained as the same thing: copycat suicides. Upon learning of another’s suicide, an uncomfortably large number of people decide suicide is an appropriate action for themselves as well. Some of these individuals then proceed to commit the act in a straightforward fashion, causing the suicide rate to jump.

Others, however, are less direct. For any of several reasons—to protect their reputations, to spare their families the shame and hurt, to allow their dependents to collect on insurance policies—they do not want to appear to have killed themselves.
