there will be strong pressures to ensure the rule does serve its purpose. Little  
wonder that influential French anthropologist Marcel Mauss, in describing  
the social pressures surrounding the gift-giving process, says there is an  
obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.  

Although an obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reciprocity  
rule, it’s the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. A  
responsibility to receive reduces our ability to choose those to whom we  
wish to be indebted and puts the power in the hands of others. Let’s  
reexamine a pair of earlier examples to see how the process works. First, in  
the Regan study, we find that the favor causing subjects to double the number  
of raffle tickets purchased from Joe was not one they had requested. Joe had  
voluntarily left the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for  
the subject. There was not a single subject who refused the favor. It is easy to  
see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe’s gift: he had already  
spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in the situation,  
especially because Joe had one himself; and it would have been considered  
impolite to reject Joe’s thoughtful action. Nevertheless, receipt of that Coke  
produced a feeling of indebtedness that became clear when Joe announced  
his desire to sell raffle tickets. Notice the important asymmetry here—all the  
genuinely free choices were Joe’s. He chose the form of the initial favor, and  
he chose the form of the return favor. Of course, one could say that the  
subject had the choice of refusing both of Joe’s offers, but those would have  
been tough choices. To have said no at either point would have required the  
subject to go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation.  

The ability of uninvited gifts to produce feelings of obligation is  
recognized by a variety of organizations. How many times has each of us  
received small gifts through the mail—personalized address labels, greeting  
cards, key rings—from charitable agencies that ask for funds in an  
accompanying note? I have received five in just the past year, two from  
disabled veterans’ groups and the others from missionary schools and  
hospitals. In each case, there was a common thread in the accompanying  
message. The goods that were enclosed were to be considered a gift from the  
organization, and money I wished to send should not be regarded as payment  
but rather as a return offering. As the letter from one of the missionary  
programs stated, the packet of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be  
directly paid for but was designed “to encourage your [my] kindness.” We can see why it would be beneficial for the organization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of as merchandise: there is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one, but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product.⁹
