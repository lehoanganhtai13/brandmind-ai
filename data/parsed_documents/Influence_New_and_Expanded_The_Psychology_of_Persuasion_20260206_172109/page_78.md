> **Interviewer:** Every doctor makes an occasional mistake. But most of those mistakes don’t turn into malpractice suits. Why do some doctors get sued more than others?

> **Burkin:** I’d say the most important factor in many of our cases—besides the negligence itself—is the quality of the doctor-patient relationship. In all the years I’ve been in this business, I’ve never had a potential client walk in and say, “I really like this doctor, but I want to sue him.” . . . People just don’t sue the doctors they like.

# Liking for Profit

The clearest illustration I know of the commercial exploitation of the liking rule is the Tupperware “home party,” which I consider a classic compliance setting. Anybody familiar with the workings of a Tupperware party will recognize the use of the various principles of influence covered in this book:

* **Reciprocation:** To start, games are played and prizes won by the partygoers; anyone who doesn’t win a prize gets to choose one from a grab bag so that everyone has received a gift before the buying begins.

* **Authority:** The quality and safety of Tupperware products are shown to be certified by experts.

* **Social Proof:** Once the buying begins, each purchase builds the idea that other, similar people want the products; therefore, they must be good.

* **Scarcity:** Unique benefits and limited-time offers are always described.

* **Commitment and Consistency:** Early on, participants are urged to make a public commitment to Tupperware by describing aloud the uses and benefits they have found for the Tupperware they already own.

* **Unity:** Upon making a purchase, guests are welcomed to “the Tupperware family.”

Although each of the principles of influence is present to help things along, the real power of the Tupperware party comes from a particular arrangement that trades on the liking rule.
