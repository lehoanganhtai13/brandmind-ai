  "summary_markdown": "This data presents the number of commercial airplane fatalities across a timeline, indicated by years relative to a reference point (year 0). The timeline spans from two years prior to year 0 (-2) to eleven years after year 0 (+11). Fatalities are recorded as zero for the initial three years (-2, -1, 0). A notable increase occurs in year +1, with 10 fatalities, followed by a significant surge to 20 in year +2 and peaking at 80 in year +3. The number of fatalities then declines to 90 in year +4, before dropping to 40 in year +5 and 20 in year +6. A subsequent rise to 50 fatalities is observed in year +7, followed by a decrease to 10 in year +8. The data shows zero fatalities for the final three years presented (+9, +10, +11). This structure illustrates a temporal pattern of commercial airplane fatalities, characterized by an initial period of no incidents, followed by a period of significant increase and subsequent decrease, and finally a return to zero fatalities.",
