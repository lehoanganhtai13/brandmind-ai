  "summary_markdown": "This data presents the number of noncommercial airplane fatalities across a timeline, indicated by years relative to a reference point (year 0). The fatalities are tracked from year -2 to year +11. The numbers show a general upward trend in fatalities from year -2 (30) to year +6 (70), after which the trend reverses, with fatalities decreasing from year +7 (30) to year +11 (30). The peak in fatalities occurs around year +6, with a subsequent decline and stabilization towards the end of the observed period. This structure suggests an analysis of fatality trends over time, highlighting a period of increase followed by a decrease.",
