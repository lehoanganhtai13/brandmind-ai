  "summary_markdown": "This data illustrates the fluctuations in monthly suicide rates relative to a specific event, likely a media story, as indicated by the column headers. The observed rates show a significant increase during the month of the story, with a difference of +1300 compared to usual rates. This surge is followed by a substantial, though diminished, increase in the month immediately after the story (+900). The elevated rates persist for a longer duration, with a smaller positive difference observed two months after (+100) and a slight increase three months after (+200). Conversely, the month preceding the story shows a decrease in suicide rates (-200), suggesting a potential temporal relationship where the event is associated with a temporary spike in suicide occurrences. The structure is comparative, highlighting deviations from a baseline over a defined time period.",
