  "summary_markdown": "This Dilbert comic strip illustrates a humorous interaction regarding a \"great idea\" for upgrading customer support software. The dialogue reveals a disconnect in memory and ownership of the idea, with one character initially denying it, then acknowledging it as potentially their own due to its perceived genius. The conversation then shifts to the practicalities of funding and project prioritization, highlighting the perceived ease of securing budget approval for a \"genius\" idea. The core of the interaction revolves around the concept of \"bossifying\" an idea, implying a process of self-promotion or strategic framing to gain approval and resources, even if the original idea's authorship is unclear or contested. The structure is a conversational exchange, revealing character dynamics and a commentary on workplace dynamics.",
