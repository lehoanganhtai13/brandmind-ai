  "summary_markdown": "This data presents the number of motor vehicle fatalities over a period of 13 years, indicated by time points -2 through +11. The structure is a simple time-series observation, showing a consistent increase in fatalities from year -2 (235) to year +11 (335). Specifically, fatalities rose by 10 units each year from year -2 to year +9, reaching a peak of 335. For the subsequent years, +10, +11, and +12, the number of fatalities dropped to zero, suggesting a significant change or cessation of reporting in the later period. The overall trend observed is a steady, linear increase in motor vehicle fatalities for the initial 12-year span, followed by an abrupt and complete halt.",
