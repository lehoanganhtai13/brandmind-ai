  "summary_markdown": "This diagram presents a self-report measure for assessing relationship dynamics, specifically focusing on the perceived relationship with a partner. It employs a comparative approach, prompting individuals to circle a picture that best describes their relationship. The structure involves paired choices, where \"Self\" and \"Other\" represent distinct perspectives within each choice. The diagram offers multiple such paired options, suggesting a range of relationship configurations or qualities are being evaluated. The core function is to capture an individual's subjective interpretation of their bond with their partner through a visual, comparative selection process.",
