The *Friends Store* has a 15% higher sales rate and a 50% higher average order value.”

**Author’s note:** I am particularly taken with the evidence from Levi’s *Friends Store*, as its influence doesn’t come from friends who say they like the styles that the *Store*’s members have chosen. Rather, it comes from knowledge of the *existing* style preferences of friends, which then increases purchases of those styles.

Instructively, the closer the friendship (and the accompanying sense of unity), the stronger the influence of our friends’ behaviors on our own. In a massive political-election experiment involving sixty-one million people, a Facebook message urging them to vote was most successful if it included photographs of Facebook friends who had already voted and, critically, one of the photos was of a *close* friend.

Finally, more than among close friends, there is an even greater type of felt unity among *best* friends. Special labels and assertions—such as “We are besties” or “We’re BFFs” (Best Friends Forever)—convey the strength of the bond. In a study of college students’ drinking behaviors, a student’s weekly alcohol intake, frequency of drinking, and alcohol-related problems most conformed to the levels of his or her best friend.<sup>9</sup>

Everybody yawns, often because of states such as sleepiness or boredom. For our purposes, there’s a more psychologically interesting cause that implicates the influence process: contagious yawning, which occurs only because someone else has yawned. True to what we know about the effect of feelings of unity on human responding, the frequency of contagious yawning is directly related to the degree of personal attachment between the first and second yawner. Contagious yawning is likely to occur most among kin, followed by friends, then acquaintances, and least among strangers. Something similar takes place in other species (chimps, baboons, bonobos, and wolves), with one animal’s yawn spurring yawns principally from kin or friendly contacts.

We know that contagious yawning happens within members of the same species and, chiefly, within members of “we”-based units of that species. Is there any indication that this sort of influence works across species? A study out of Japan tells us there is, and the evidence is, uh, jaw-dropping. The species members are humans, on the one hand, and dogs (often revealingly termed “Man’s best friend”), on the other.
