doing, gives the tactics their power. This book is organized around these  
seven principles, one to a chapter. The principles—reciprocation, liking,  
social proof, authority, scarcity, commitment and consistency, and unity—are  
discussed both in terms of their function in society and in terms of how their  
enormous force can be commissioned by a compliance professional who  
deftly incorporates them into requests for purchases, donations, concessions,  
votes, or assent.¹  

Each principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct kind of  
automatic, mindless compliance from people: a willingness to say yes  
without thinking first. The evidence suggests that the ever-accelerating pace  
and informational crush of modern life will make this particular form of  
unthinking compliance more and more prevalent in the future. It will be  
increasingly important for society, therefore, to understand the how and why  
of automatic influence.  

Finally, in this edition, I’ve sequenced the chapters to fit with the insights  
of my colleague Dr. Gregory Neidert regarding how certain principles are  
more useful than others, depending on which persuasive goal the  
communicator wishes to achieve with a message. Of course, any would-be  
influencer wants to create change in others; but, according to Dr. Neidert’s  
Core Motives Model of Social Influence, the communicator’s prime goal at  
the time affects which influence principles the communicator should  
prioritize. For instance, the model asserts that one of the main motives  
(goals) of a persuader involves *cultivating a positive relationship*. Research  
shows that messages are more likely to be successful if recipients can first be  
made to feel positively toward the messenger. Three of the seven principles  
of influence—reciprocation, liking, and unity—seem particularly appropriate  
to the task.  

In other situations, perhaps when a good relationship is already in place,  
the goal of *reducing uncertainty* may be a priority. After all, having a  
positive relationship with a communicator doesn’t necessarily mean message  
recipients will be persuaded. Before they are likely to change their minds,  
people want to be assured any decision they are being urged to make is wise.  
Under these circumstances, according to the model, the principles of social  
proof and authority should never be ignored—because evidence that a choice  
is well regarded by peers or by experts makes it, indeed, appear prudent.
