He's looking at my transcript... So how do you like them apples, Pops? Tsk... tsk... So how long have you wanted to go to law school, son? Gosh, Pop, as long as I can remember, sir! Looks like your pop's been studying as for about thirty long years, too. Well, yes I guess that's so! Well, everybody who helps a person has a special part to play. Personally I long to seal the deal with a law-grade transcript, but I can control it, gosh darn it! Try TDA transcript! It doesn't! Your sorry. Yes—but it's not my fault! I spent enough all those years! Of course you didn't, but what can I do?

Besides its capacity to combat the perception of grade inflation, a weakness can become a strength in a variety of other situations. For example, one study found that letters of recommendation sent to the personnel directors of major corporations produced the most favorable results for job candidates when the letters contained one unflattering comment about the candidate in an otherwise wholly positive set of remarks (Knouse, 1983).

Hoping to find out how they operate, years ago I applied for a position as a waiter at several fairly expensive restaurants. Without experience, though, the best I could do was to land a busboy job that, as things turned out, provided me a propitious vantage point from which to watch and analyze the action. Before long, I realized what the other employees already knew: the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent, who somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher. The other servers were not even close to him in weekly earnings.

I began to linger in my duties around Vincent’s tables to observe his technique. I quickly learned his style was to have no single style. He had a repertoire of approaches, each ready for the appropriate circumstances. With a family, he was effervescent, even slightly clownish, directing his remarks as often to the children as to the adults.
