With that measure in hand, researchers have investigated which factors lead to greater feelings of shared identity and how the factors operate.²  
The range of circumstances and settings where “we” relationships affect human responding is impressive and varied. Nonetheless, three constants have emerged. First, members of “we”-based groups favor the outcomes and welfare of fellow members over those of nonmembers—by a mile. For example, members of rival work groups (that each included two humans and two robots) not only held more positive attitudes toward their own teammates but also went so far as to hold more positive attitudes toward their own team’s robots than toward the rival team’s robots—and humans! Second, “we”-group members are highly likely to use the preferences and actions of fellow members to guide their own, which is a tendency that ensures group solidarity. Finally, these partisan urges to favor and follow have arisen, evolutionarily, as ways to advantage our “we” groups and, ultimately, ourselves. Indeed, after reviewing decades of relevant scientific work on the point, one set of scholars concluded not just that tribalism is universal but that “tribalism is human nature.” A look into our most basic social realms demonstrates how pervasively and powerfully the bias operates, often in *click, run* fashion.³

This diagram presents a self-report measure for assessing relationship dynamics, specifically focusing on the perceived relationship with a partner. It employs a comparative approach, prompting individuals to circle a picture that best describes their relationship. The structure involves paired choices, where "Self" and "Other" represent distinct perspectives within each choice. The diagram offers multiple such paired options, suggesting a range of relationship configurations or qualities are being evaluated. The core function is to capture an individual's subjective interpretation of their bond with their partner through a visual, comparative selection process.

**Figure 8.1: Overlapping circles, overlapping selves** Since its publication in 1992, scientists have been using the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale to see which factors promote the feeling of being “at one” with another individual.
