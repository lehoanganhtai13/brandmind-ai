**Cialdini**: Do come in.

**SYW**: No, thank you. I’ll just stay right here and begin. How many times per week would you say you go out to dinner?

**C:** Oh, probably three, maybe four times a week. Whenever I can, really; I love fine restaurants.

**SYW:** How nice. And do you usually order wine with your dinner?

**C:** Only if it’s imported.

**SYW:** I see. What about movies? Do you go to the movies much?

**C:** The *cinema*? I can’t get enough of good films. I especially like the sophisticated kind with the words on the bottom of the screen. How about you? Do you like to see films?

**SYW:** Uh . . . yes, I do. But let’s get back to the interview. Do you go to many concerts?

**C:** Definitely. The symphonic stuff mostly, of course. But I do enjoy a quality pop group as well.

**SYW:** *(writing rapidly)*. Great! Just one more question. What about touring performances by theatrical or ballet companies? Do you see them when they’re in town?

**C:** Ah, the ballet—the movement, the grace, the form—I love it. Mark me down as *loving* the ballet. See it every chance I get.

**SYW:** Fine. Just let me recheck my figures here for a moment, Mr. Cialdini.

**C:** Actually, it’s Dr. Cialdini. But that sounds so formal. Why don’t you call me Bob?

**SYW:** All right, *Bob*. From the information you’ve already given me, I’m pleased to say you could save up to $1,200 a year by joining *Clubamerica*! A small membership fee entitles you to discounts on most of the activities you’ve mentioned. Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tremendous savings our company can offer on all the things you’ve already told me you do.

**C** *(trapped like a rat)*: Well . . . uh . . . I . . . uh . . . I guess so.

I remember quite well feeling my stomach tighten as I stammered my agreement. It was a clear call to my brain, “Hey, you’re being taken here!” But I couldn’t see a way out. I had been cornered by my own words. To decline her offer at that point would have meant facing a pair of distasteful alternatives: If I tried to back out by protesting that I was not actually the man-about-town I had claimed to be, I would come off a liar; trying to refuse without that protest would make me come off a fool for not wanting to save $1,200.
