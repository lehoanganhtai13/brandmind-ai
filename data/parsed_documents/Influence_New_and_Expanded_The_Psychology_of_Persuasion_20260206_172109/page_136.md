so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs  
would become *truer*. The principle of social proof says so: *The greater the  
number of people who find any idea correct, the more a given individual  
will perceive the idea to be correct.* The group’s assignment was clear;  
because the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had  
to be. Convince, and ye shall be convinced.³  

# Optimizers

All the levers of influence discussed in this book work better under some  
conditions than others. If we are to defend ourselves adequately against any  
such lever, it is vital that we know its optimal operating conditions in order  
to recognize when we are most vulnerable to its influence. In the case of  
social proof, there are three main optimizing conditions: when we are unsure  
of what is best to do (uncertainty); when the evidence of what is best to do  
comes from numerous others (the many); and when that evidence comes from  
people like us (similarity).  

## *Uncertainty: In Its Throes, Conformity Grows*  
We have already had a hint of when the principle of social proof worked  
best with the Chicago believers. It was when a sense of shaken confidence  
triggered their craving for converts, for new believers who could validate  
the truth of the original believers’ views. In general, when we are unsure of  
ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty  
reigns, we are most likely to accept the actions of others—because those  
actions reduce our uncertainty about what is correct behavior there.  
One way uncertainty develops is through lack of familiarity with the  
situation. Under such circumstances, people are especially likely to follow  
the lead of others. Remember this chapter’s account of restaurant managers in  
Beijing who greatly increased customers’ purchases of certain dishes on the  
menu by describing them as most popular? Although the labeled popularity of  
an item elevated its choice by all sorts of diners (males, females, customers  
of any age), there was one kind of customer that was most likely to choose  
based on popularity—those who were infrequent and, therefore, unfamiliar visitors.
