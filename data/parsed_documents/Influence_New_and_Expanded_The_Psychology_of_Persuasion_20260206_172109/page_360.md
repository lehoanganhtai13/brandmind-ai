Besides, because of their common grounding in emotion and harmony, music and romance are strongly associated with one another in life. What would you say is the percentage of contemporary songs with romance as their subject? It’s 80 percent, the vast majority. That’s amazing. Romance isn’t at issue the vast majority of the time when we speak or think or write, but it is when we sing.

Now I understand why young women, who are at an age-peak for interest in both romance and music, have a weakness for musicians. Powerful links between the two types of experiences make musicians hard to resist. Want some scientific proof? If not, just pretend I’m *singing* you the results of a French study in which the (initially skeptical) researchers had a man approach young women and ask for their phone numbers while he was carrying a guitar case, a sports bag, or nothing:

> 🎵*Those scientists in France / worried about raising the chance / a guitar would prompt a “Oui” / to a stranger’s startling plea / need not have been so troubled. / Phone numbers more than doubled.*🎵

This figure illustrates a humorous, albeit speculative, relationship between guitar sales and perceived attractiveness, suggesting a potential correlation where "ugly guys with good looking girls" might lead to increased guitar sales. The diagram presents a simple, unidirectional flow, implying that the presence of attractive partners for less conventionally attractive individuals could somehow stimulate the market for guitars. It's a conceptual representation, not based on empirical data, aiming to draw a lighthearted connection between social dynamics and consumer behavior in a specific product category. The structure is a direct, cause-and-effect suggestion, linking a social observation to an economic outcome.

For anyone interested in maximizing persuasive success, the critical takeaway from this section should not be merely that music is allied with System 1 responding or that, when channeled to that kind of responding, people act imprudently. The far larger lesson involves the importance of matching the System 1 versus 2 character of a persuasive communication with the System 1 versus 2 mindset of its intended audience. Recipients with nonrational, hedonistic goals should be matched with messages containing nonrational elements such as musical accompaniment, whereas those with rational, pragmatic goals should be matched with messages containing rational elements such as facts.
