To date, researchers have only examined the transmission from owner to pet. I’m not a betting man, but I’d wager good money that it works in both directions.

# Unity I: Belonging Together

### Kinship

From a genetic point of view, being in the same family—the same bloodline—is the ultimate form of self–other unity. Indeed, it is widely accepted within evolutionary biology that individuals do not so much attempt to ensure their own survival as the survival of copies of their genes. The implication is that the “self” in self-interest can lie outside one’s body and inside the skin of related others who share a goodly amount of genetic material. For this reason, people are particularly willing to help genetically close relatives, especially in survival-related decisions, such as whether to donate a kidney in the United States, rescue someone from a burning building in Japan, or intervene in an axe fight in the jungles of Venezuela. Brain-imaging research has identified one cause: People experience unusually high stimulation of the self-reward centers of their brains after aiding a family member; it’s almost as if, by doing so, they are aiding themselves . . . and this is true even of teenagers!

*READER’S REPORT 8.1*  
**From a nurse living in Sydney, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic**

I recently entered into a store for some essentials and used the hand sanitiser offered by the security guard. I noticed a person who worked at the store’s pharmacy decline to use sanitiser when entering the store. This scenario is not limited to this one instance. I have seen many more instances of people in stores who were irresponsible, for example, with the recommendation for social distancing.
