She went directly to the rail crossing where his peers had died.  
Perhaps nowhere are we brought into more dramatic contact with the unsettling side of the principle of social proof than in the realm of copycat crime. Back in the 1970s, our attention was brought to the phenomenon in the form of airplane hijackings, which seemed to spread like airborne viruses. In the 1980s, our focus shifted to product tamperings, such as the famous cases of Tylenol capsules injected with cyanide and Gerber baby-food products laced with glass. According to FBI forensic experts, each nationally publicized incident of this sort spawned an average of thirty more incidents. Since then, we’ve been jolted by the specter of contagious mass murders, occurring first in workplace settings and then, incredibly, in our children’s schools.

This data presents the number of commercial airplane fatalities across a timeline, indicated by years relative to a reference point (year 0). The timeline spans from two years prior to year 0 (-2) to eleven years after year 0 (+11). Fatalities are recorded as zero for the initial three years (-2, -1, 0). A notable increase occurs in year +1, with 10 fatalities, followed by a significant surge to 20 in year +2 and peaking at 80 in year +3. The number of fatalities then declines to 90 in year +4, before dropping to 40 in year +5 and 20 in year +6. A subsequent rise to 50 fatalities is observed in year +7, followed by a decrease to 10 in year +8. The data shows zero fatalities for the final three years presented (+9, +10, +11). This structure illustrates a temporal pattern of commercial airplane fatalities, characterized by an initial period of no incidents, followed by a period of significant increase and subsequent decrease, and finally a return to zero fatalities.

This data presents the number of noncommercial airplane fatalities across a timeline, indicated by years relative to a reference point (year 0). The fatalities are tracked from year -2 to year +11. The numbers show a general upward trend in fatalities from year -2 (30) to year +6 (70), after which the trend reverses, with fatalities decreasing from year +7 (30) to year +11 (30). The peak in fatalities occurs around year +6, with a subsequent decline and stabilization towards the end of the observed period. This structure suggests an analysis of fatality trends over time, highlighting a period of increase followed by a decrease.

This data presents the number of motor vehicle fatalities over a period of 13 years, indicated by time points -2 through +11. The structure is a simple time-series observation, showing a consistent increase in fatalities from year -2 (235) to year +11 (335). Specifically, fatalities rose by 10 units each year from year -2 to year +9, reaching a peak of 335. For the subsequent years, +10, +11, and +12, the number of fatalities dropped to zero, suggesting a significant change or cessation of reporting in the later period. The overall trend observed is a steady, linear increase in motor vehicle fatalities for the initial 12-year span, followed by an abrupt and complete halt.
