Censorship
The tendency to want what is banned, and, therefore, presume it more
worthwhile, is not confined to commodities such as laundry soap; it also
extends to restrictions on information. In an age when the ability to acquire,
store, and manage information increasingly affects access to wealth and
power, it is important to understand how we typically react to attempts to
censor or constrain our access to information. Although much evidence exists
concerning our reactions to observing various kinds of potentially censorable
material—media violence, pornography, radical political rhetoric—there is
surprisingly little evidence on our reactions to the censoring of this material.
Fortunately, the results of the relatively few studies that have been done on
censorship are highly consistent. Almost invariably, our response to banned
information is to want to receive the information and to become more
favorable toward it than we were before the ban.
The intriguing finding within the effects of censored information on an
audience is not that audience members want to have the information more
than before; that seems natural. Rather, it is that they come to believe in the
information more, even though they haven’t received it. For example, when
University of North Carolina students learned that a speech opposing coed
dorms on campus would be banned, they became more opposed to the idea of
coed dorms. Thus, without ever hearing the speech, the students became more
sympathetic to its argument. This raises the worrisome possibility that
especially clever individuals holding a weak or unpopular position can get
us to agree with the position by arranging to have their message restricted.
The irony is that for such people—members of fringe political groups,
for example—the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their
unpopular views but to get those views officially censored and then to
publicize the censorship. Perhaps the authors of the US Constitution were
acting as much as sophisticated social psychologists as staunch civil
libertarians  when they wrote the  remarkably   permissive free-speech
provision of the First Amendment. By refusing to restrain freedom of speech,
they may have been trying to minimize the chance that new political notions
would win support via the irrational course of psychological reactance.
Of course, political ideas are not the only kind susceptible to restriction.
Access to sexually oriented material is also frequently limited. Although not
as sensational as the occasional police crackdown on adult bookstores and
theaters, regular pressure is applied by parents’ and citizens’ groups to censor the sexual content of educational material ranging from sex-education and -hygiene texts to school library books.
