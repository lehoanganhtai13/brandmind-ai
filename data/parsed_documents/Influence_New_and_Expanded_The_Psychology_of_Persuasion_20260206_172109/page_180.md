We can cruise  
along until the exploiters’ deception is spotted, at which time we can pounce.  

And we should pounce with a vengeance. I am speaking of more than  
simply ignoring the misinformation, although this defensive tactic is certainly  
called for. I am speaking of aggressive counterattack. Whenever possible, we  
ought to sting those responsible for the rigging of social evidence. We should  
purchase no products associated with biased “unrehearsed interview”  
commercials or artificial waiting lines. Moreover, each manufacturer of the  
items should receive a forceful comment on its website explaining our  
response and recommending that they discontinue use of the advertising or  
marketing agency that produced so deceptive a presentation of their product.  

Although we don’t always want to trust the actions of others to direct our  
conduct—especially in situations important enough to warrant our personal  
investigation of the pros and cons, or ones in which we are experts—we do  
want to be able to count on others’ behavior as a source of valid information  
in a wide range of settings. If we find in such settings we cannot trust the  
information to be valid because someone has tampered with the evidence, we  
ought to be ready to strike back. In such instances, I personally feel driven by  
more than an aversion to being duped. I bristle at the thought of being pushed  
into an unacceptable corner by those who would use one of my hedges  
against the decisional overload of modern life against me. And I get a  
genuine sense of righteousness by lashing out when they try. If you are like  
me—and many others like me—so should you.  

### *Looking Up*  
In addition to the times when social proof is deliberately faked, there is  
another time when the principle will regularly steer us wrong. In such an  
instance, an innocent, natural error will produce snowballing social proof  
that pushes us to an incorrect decision. The pluralistic-ignorance  
phenomenon, in which everyone at an emergency sees no cause for alarm, is  
one example of this process.  

The best illustration I know, however, comes from Singapore, where a  
few years ago, for no good reason, customers of a local bank began drawing  
out their money in a frenzy. The run on this respected bank remained a  
mystery until much later, when researchers interviewing participants  
discovered its peculiar cause: An unexpected bus strike had created an abnormally large crowd waiting at the bus stop in front of the bank that day.
