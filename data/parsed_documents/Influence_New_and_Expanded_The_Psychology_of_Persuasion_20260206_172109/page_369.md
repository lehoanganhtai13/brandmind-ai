This Dilbert comic strip illustrates a humorous interaction regarding a "great idea" for upgrading customer support software. The dialogue reveals a disconnect in memory and ownership of the idea, with one character initially denying it, then acknowledging it as potentially their own due to its perceived genius. The conversation then shifts to the practicalities of funding and project prioritization, highlighting the perceived ease of securing budget approval for a "genius" idea. The core of the interaction revolves around the concept of "bossifying" an idea, implying a process of self-promotion or strategic framing to gain approval and resources, even if the original idea's authorship is unclear or contested. The structure is a conversational exchange, revealing character dynamics and a commentary on workplace dynamics.

Creative accounting is a recognized business trick and so, apparently, is creative co-creation.

# Asking for Advice Is Good Advice

Co-creation doesn’t only reduce the problem of getting supervisors to give more credit to employees who’ve worked productively on a project. It can lessen a host of other traditionally hard to diminish difficulties. Children below the age of six or seven are typically selfish when it comes to sharing rewards, rarely distributing them equally with playmates—unless they have obtained those rewards through a collaborative effort with a playmate, whereupon even three-year-olds share equally the majority of the time. As we saw in chapter 3, in the standard classroom, students tend to coalesce along racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines, finding friends and helpmates mainly within their own groups, but this pattern declines significantly after they’ve engaged co-creatively with students from the other groups within “cooperative learning” exercises. Companies struggle to get consumers to feel bonded with and therefore loyal to their brands; it’s a battle they’ve been winning by inviting current and prospective customers to co-create with them.
