*From a college student in New Delhi, India*

I am writing to you about an incident where the consistency principle compelled me to make a decision that I would not have made under ordinary circumstances. I had gone to the food court of a mall where I decided to buy a small glass of Coke.  
“One glass of Coke, please,” I said to the salesman at the counter.  
“Medium or Large?,” he asked me as he was billing another customer.  
“I’ve already eaten enough. There is no way I could gulp down a large glass of Coke,” I thought to myself. “Medium,” I said confidently as I handed him the card for payment.  
“Oh! Sorry,” said the salesperson with the impression of having made a genuine mistake. “Small or Medium?”  
“Uhm, Medium,” I said in line with the consistency principle, took my drink and left so the next person could order, only to realize that I had been duped into buying the larger of the two options.  
I was caught off guard, and to be consistent with my previously placed order, I blurted out “Medium,” without even processing the new information given to me.  
A foolish consistency definitely seems to be the hobgoblin of little minds!

**Author’s note:** I think the reader, who seems to have considered herself little-minded in the situation, is being too hard on herself. When we are rushed or not able to think deeply about a choice, mechanical consistency is the norm (Fennis, Janssen, & Vohs, 2009).

# Stomach Signs

The first signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we *know* we don’t want to perform. It’s happened to me a hundred times. An especially memorable instance took place on a summer evening when, as a young man well before I wrote this book, I answered my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dressed in shorts and a revealing halter top. I noticed, nonetheless, she was carrying a clipboard and was asking me to participate in a survey. Wanting to make a favorable impression, I agreed and, I do admit, stretched the truth in my interview answers to present myself in the most positive light. Our conversation went as follows:

*Stunning Young Woman:* Hello! I’m doing a survey on the entertainment habits of city residents, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions for me.
