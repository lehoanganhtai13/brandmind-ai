Sony Pictures Entertainment was
caught arranging for employees to portray fans lauding the Sony film The
Patriot for an ad that then aired on network TV
                             . The employees’ boss
excused the deceptive practice of hiring actors or employees for testimonials
as “an  industry standard,”  not unique to Sony Pictures or even the
entertainment business. A different version of this kind of fakery occurs when
actors are hired to line up outside movie theaters or shops to simulate
widespread interest. An illustration of how profiteers sometimes resort to
contrived popularity for their products occurred at the launch of the first
Apple iPhone in Poland. The advertising agency responsible for the Apple
account admitted to falsifying social proof in favor of their client’s phone.
How did they do it? According to a spokesperson, on the day of the launch,
“We created fake queues [of paid actors] in front of twenty stores around the
country to drum up interest.”

                                             I know that whenever I encounter or learn of an influence attempt of this
sort, it sets off in me a kind of alarm with a clear directive:                                             Attention!
Attention!                                                                May be bad social proof in this  situation. Temporarily
disconnect autopilot. It’s easy to do. We need only make a conscious decision to be alert to evidence of biased social evidence.
