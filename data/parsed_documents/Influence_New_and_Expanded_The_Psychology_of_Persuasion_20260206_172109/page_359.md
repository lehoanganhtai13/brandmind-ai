Music’s influence is of the System 1 rather than System 2 variety. Take,
for instance, musician Elvis Costello’s quote concerning the difficulty of
properly describing music through the cognitive process of writing: “Writing
about music,” he said, “is like dancing about architecture.”
                      As additional support for the mismatch between cognition and emotion,
this time in romance, consider the line from Bill Withers’s song “Ain’t No
Sunshine” about a man agonizing over a woman who has left their home yet
again: “And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know / Hey, I
oughta leave young thing alone / But ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone.”
Withers makes his point in the purest form of poetry I’ve ever heard in a
popular song lyric: In the throes of romantic love, what one may recognize
cognitively (twenty-six times!) doesn’t amend what one feels emotionally.
                  In their sensory and visceral responses to music, people sing, swing, and
sway in rhythmic alignment with it—and, if together, with one another.
Rarely do they think analytically while music is prominent in consciousness.
Under music’s influence, the deliberative, rational route to knowing becomes
difficult to access and, hence, largely unavailable. Two commentaries speak
to a regrettable upshot. The first, a quote from V
oltaire, is contemptuous:
“Anything too stupid to be spoken is sung.” The second, an adage from the
advertising profession, is tactical: “If you can’t make your case to an
audience with facts, sing it to them.” Thus, communicators whose ideas have
little rational firepower don’t have to give up the fight; they can undertake a
flanking maneuver. Equipping themselves with music and song, they can
move their campaign to a battleground where rationality possesses little
force, where sensations of harmony, synchrony, and unity win the day.
This recognition has helped me resolve a long-standing personal mystery,
one that was particularly vexing to me as a young man with no musical talent.
Why are young women so attracted to musicians? There’s no logic to it,
right? Precisely. It doesn’t matter that the probabilities of a successful
relationship with most musicians are notoriously low; those are                    rational
probabilities. And it doesn’t matter that the current and future financial
prospects of most musicians are equally low; those are economic reasons.
Music isn’t about such practicalities. It’s about harmonies—melodic ones that lead to emotional ones.
