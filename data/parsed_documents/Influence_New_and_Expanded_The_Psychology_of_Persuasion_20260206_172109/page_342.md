for the continuing vitality of Berkshire Hathaway in coming years.
Implicit in the fifty-year character of the anniversary was a concern that
had been around for a while but that was reasserting itself in online
commentary: A half-century into the enterprise, Buffett and Munger were no
youngsters, and should either no longer be present to lead the company, its
future prospects and share price could tumble. I remember reading the
commentary and being troubled by it. Would the value of my stock, which had
more than quadrupled under Buffett and Munger’s management, hold up if
either departed because of advancing age? Was it time to sell and take my
extraordinary profits before they might evaporate?
In his letter, Buffett addressed the issue head-on—specifically, in the
section labeled “The Next 50 Years at Berkshire,” in which he laid out the
affirmative, forward-reaching consequences of Berkshire Hathaway’s proven
business model, its nearly unprecedented bulwark of financial assets, and the
firm’s already completed identification of the “right person” to take over as
CEO when appropriate. More telling for me as a persuasion scientist was
how Buffett began that all-important section. In characteristic fashion, he
reestablished his  trustworthiness by being upfront about a       potential
weakness: “Now let’s look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had
attempted 50 years ago to gauge what was coming, certain of my predictions
would have been far off the mark.” Then, he did something I’d never seen or
heard him do in any public forum. He added, “With that warning, I will tell
you what I would say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s
future.”
What followed      was careful construction of the  case for      Berkshire
Hathaway’s foreseeable economic health—the proven business model, the
bulwark of    financial assets, the scrupulously  vetted future   CEO. As
convincing as these components of his argument were on their merits, Buffett
had done something that made me judge them as even more convincing. He
had claimed that he was going to advise me about them as he would a family
member. Because of everything I knew about the man, I believed that claim.
As a result, I have never since thought seriously about selling my Berkshire
Hathaway stock. There’s a memorable moment in the movie Jerry Maguire
in which the title character played by Tom Cruise bursts into a room, greets
the inhabitants (including his estranged wife, Dorothy, played by Renee
Zellweger), and launches into a long soliloquy in which he lists the reasons she should continue to be his life partner.
