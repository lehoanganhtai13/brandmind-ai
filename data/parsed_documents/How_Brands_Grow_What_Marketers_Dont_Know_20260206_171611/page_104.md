Which leads us to question whether it is possible for a brand to build exceptional emotional or symbolically based loyalty. How important to a brand are these special, committed customers? Have some brands excelled at building passionate user bases?

# Brand fanatics

It’s long been fashionable in marketing to uphold brand fanatics as ideal customers. While most buyers who are 100% loyal to a brand are simply light category buyers, there are a (very) few customers who both regularly buy from the category and yet are very loyal to one brand. There are also a few buyers who claim to be passionate about a brand. How important are these people? Who are they? How does a brand attract more passionate consumers?

Don Gorske is a perfect example. This Wisconsin resident has consumed more than 23,000 Big Macs; he claims that the Big Mac constitutes more than 90% of his solid food intake. We know that he’s eaten more than 23,000 Big Macs because he records the ongoing total in a notebook. This apparently is just one example of his obsessive behaviour. Don Gorske, to put it mildly, is a little odd.[^53] Every brand has a few very loyal and heavy buyers, a few passionate advocates.

The Lovemarks website lists thousands of brands that have been nominated as Lovemarks by visitors to the website. These are brands that some people feel passionate about (or at least feel so some of the time). The Lovemarks list is moderated and nominees have to make a case for a brand’s inclusion. Yet when I looked the list still includes prosaic brands such as 7-Eleven. Also, Air New Zealand, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air Jamaica, KLM, Korean Air, Qantas and Swiss Air all got nominated, as did many other airlines. Among car manufacturers, General Motors, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota and Saturn have all been nominated.[^54] This shows that any brand can have a few fans, a few Don Gorskes; but, it does not show that some brands are special or that these fans are of any financial or strategic consequence to marketers. These make for an entertaining story and that’s all. Advertising agencies, who in general know very little about buyer behaviour, seem to love these stories.
