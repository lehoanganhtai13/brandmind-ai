This data presents a comparative analysis of deodorant brands, detailing their market share and the concentration of purchasing volume among their heaviest 20% of buyers over two distinct periods: 3 months and 12 months. Brands are ranked by market share, with Sure leading at 16% and several brands sharing 1-3% at the lower end. For each brand, the percentage of total volume contributed by the top 20% of consumers is shown for both the 3-month and 12-month periods. For instance, Impulse, with an 8% market share, shows its heaviest buyers accounting for 45% of volume over 3 months and 55% over 12 months. The data also includes an overall average, indicating that across all brands, the heaviest 20% of buyers contribute 39% of volume over 3 months and 50% over 12 months, highlighting a general trend of increased purchasing concentration over longer timeframes.

This data presents a comparative analysis of various product categories, detailing the percentage of brand volume attributed to their top 20% of consumers. The structure highlights a concentration of consumption within a small consumer segment across diverse product types. Soft drinks exhibit the highest concentration, with 64% of brand volume coming from their top consumers, followed closely by Refrigerated Yoghurt at 60%. Other categories like Dry Cat food and Dog food, and Breakfast cereals show a significant, though slightly lower, concentration at 56% and 54% respectively. As the list progresses, the concentration generally decreases, with products like Shampoo (42%) and Fabric Softeners - Aerosol (35%) showing less pronounced loyalty or reliance on a core group of heavy users. The overall average across all listed categories indicates that, on average, 50% of brand volume is driven by the top 20% of consumers, underscoring a common pattern of concentrated demand across these consumer goods.

If 80% of your customers delivered only 20% of your annual sales, it would be tempting to ignore them.
