It is also good news for advertisers who want to measure the sales effects of their advertising so that they can work out what creative executions and what media strategies work better.

In a review of his single-source data analysis of sales effective advertising, Professor John Philip Jones (1997) noted:

> “The European styles of advertising … understated,  
> softness, quirkiness, indirectness, unusual visual effects,  
> and bizarre humour … are often surprisingly effective. …  
> The advertising shown to have greatest effect … were  
> certainly not hard-selling in the conventional sense … they  
> were likeable … visual rather than verbal.”

Rather than examine in depth the findings of single-source research on advertising sales effects here is a very short summary of the important findings that are supported by findings from other reliable methodologies, such as experiments:

* advertising generates sales  
* some advertising copy is much more sales effective than others; some barely works at all  
* creative copy without a persuasive message can still be very sales effective  
* media strategy that achieves greater reach is particularly effective; reach is more important than frequency of exposure; continuous advertising is more effective than bursts followed by long gaps, because it counteracts memory decay.

All of this fits with the negative binomial distribution of buying rates (see Chapter 4). It makes sense given the importance of reaching all category buyers (see natural monopoly law), with solid coverage over time (i.e. no long gaps).

Advertising works by reaching brains and nudging buying propensities. This mostly happens without us noticing; occasionally an ad produces the reaction ‘I should buy that’ but even this intention only weakly nudges our buying propensities, because we often forget or are deflected from our intentions. This is a reminder that advertising works through its effect on memories.

# Without noticing (and processing) there is nothing An advertisement cannot build memory structures if it is not processed; memory structures cannot generate sales if they are not associated with the brand that is being advertised.
