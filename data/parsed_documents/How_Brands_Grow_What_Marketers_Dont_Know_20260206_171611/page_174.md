Screening out is a natural behaviour, people do it all the time; for example, screening out other people talking in the room, screening out advice from parents, etc. Buyers don’t care that there are many brands they do not consider, because the ones they do consider perform well enough. However, it matters enormously to marketers – our brands need to be noticed and considered. Being noticed and considered is often the biggest factor in why a brand is bought or not. Given how small buyers’ consideration sets are, a brand has more than a ‘sporting chance’ of being bought if it is noticed and considered. So, a brand’s sales are primarily determined by how many consideration sets it failed to enter.  

Similarly, in dealing with the vast volume of marketing communication people adopt incredibly capable filtering mechanisms that mean they don’t have to process most advertising. That’s why we can watch an ad over and over and still get the brand name wrong.  

# Evaluation is less important than we think  

We don’t notice ourselves not noticing things – it’s a subconscious process. This is perhaps why marketers and academics themselves largely ignore this aspect of buyer behaviour.  

Both academic and commercial marketing researchers work from an evaluation-centred view of buyer behaviour. Billions of dollars are spent on researching brand features and perceptions because these are considered to be the dominant reasons why customers buy or not. This belief is undermined by the following facts:  

* What buyers remember about brands (and which brands they remember) varies across buying occasions. Memories are imperfect and variable, as buyers are busy and have limited time to devote to any single purchase (or single market research question).  
* A buyer only considers a tiny subset of the brands they know; they do not evaluate most of the different feature-bundles on the market. Even for high involvement products like financial services and cars (see Dawes et al 2009; Lambert-Pandraud 2005). Consumers typically know a little bit about some brands and almost nothing about most brands. Customers rarely think about (the features of) these less familiar brands, let alone buy them.
