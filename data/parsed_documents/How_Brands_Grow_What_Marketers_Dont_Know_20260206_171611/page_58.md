This is the law of buyer moderation.

However, there is another law-like pattern that, in Professor Andrew Ehrenberg’s (2004) words, “should have been the end of the marketing pipedream of just recruiting heavy-buying buyers”. Let’s look at what happens to a brand’s distribution of buying rates when the brand grows its market share.

# Changes occur across heavy and light segments

Look again at Figures 4.1 and 4.2, which show the buying frequencies of Coke and Pepsi buyers.

The shapes of the distributions are very similar – going from Coke to Pepsi it looks as if the frequencies have simply slid to the left (i.e. everyone buying a little less frequently). In fact, both these distributions have the same mathematical properties; this type of distribution is called a negative binomial distribution (NBD). NBD seems to describe the purchase frequencies of all brands, and has done so for decades (it was discovered in 1959 by Andrew Ehrenberg). The NBD is typically a very skewed distribution (i.e. there are many more buyers who are lighter than the average buyer). Hence, there is a 60/20 Pareto concentration of sales volume.

This large proportion of very light buyers shows up in brand performance metrics (as we saw in Chapters 2 and 3). Remember that brands with larger market share typically have substantially higher penetration figures than smaller brands (the double jeopardy law). But in contrast, the purchase frequency scores of the larger brands (how often their buyers buy their brand) are only marginally higher. And when brands grow or decline there is a lot of change in their category penetration (the size of their buyer base) and little change in their purchase frequency. Now we can see the reason why the penetration metric shows so much change. It’s due to the NBD’s skewed distribution of buying rates. When a brand grows it recruits a lot of light buyers who become heavy enough to buy at least once during the period of analysis; so now they show up in the penetration metric. Some heavier buyers also buy a bit more frequently, but remember there aren’t many of these people so overall the average rate of buying doesn’t change much (see how little the mean average differs in the Coke and Pepsi charts). Therefore, the NBD explains the double jeopardy law.

One of the great insights is that all brands, irrespective of their size, face an NBD of heavy to light buyers. When brands grow, or decline in market share, they simply move from one weight of this distribution to another.
