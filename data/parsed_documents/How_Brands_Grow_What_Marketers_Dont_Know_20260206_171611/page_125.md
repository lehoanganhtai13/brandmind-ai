The data from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, Young & Rubicam, and Millward Brown on perceived differentiation all support this. All brands are ‘differentiated’ (they do not compete as perfect substitutes), in the sense that for each buyer there are brands that they know well and other brands they think very little about. For each buyer there are many brands he or she never or seldom considers purchasing. But this is not textbook brand differentiation in the sense of buyers perceiving brands as being meaningfully different from others.

# Distinctiveness: an alternative perspective

Paradoxically, the reduced emphasis on meaningful differentiation makes branding even more important. Loyalty is largely underpinned by mental and physical availability not love/hate. To encourage brand loyalty a brand must stand out so that buyers can easily, and without confusion, identify it. The focus on meaningful, perceived differentiation in marketing literature has distracted from this traditional aspect of branding practice.

The fundamental purpose of branding is to identify the source of the product or service. This is the reason that branding was first developed. Branding must have qualities that distinguish the brand from other competitors. One obvious characteristic is the brand name itself, which is, by law, unique. There are also other distinctive elements that, as part of a brand’s identity, can supplement or substitute for the brand name. These qualities help the consumer to notice, recognise and recall the brand – when the brand is advertising and in buying situations. These elements can include:

* colours – such as the Garnier green and the TNT orange  
* logos – such as McDonald’s golden arches  
* taglines – such as Nike’s ‘Just do it’  
* symbols/characters – such as Mickey Mouse’s ears * celebrities – such as Tiger Woods for Nike
