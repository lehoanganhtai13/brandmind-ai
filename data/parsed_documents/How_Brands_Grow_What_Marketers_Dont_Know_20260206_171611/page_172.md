No wonder brands employ celebrities and try to piggy-back on their ability to get attention.  
In 2013 Bing reported that most searched for person was Beyoncé followed by Kim Kardasian (Barack Obama came tenth) - *plus ça change, plus c’est la meme chose.*

# A cluttered world

One of the things we are cramming into our lives is more commercial media, and hence more advertising. There are plenty of uninformed reports of massive declines in television viewing, but this just isn’t happening. In general, people are not replacing television viewing with web browsing, YouTube or Social Media – they have simply added new media. People are consuming more media than ever before. In 2005, Ball State University’s Centre for Media Design undertook a large observational study of US consumers and found that (commercial and non-commercial) media consumption (listening, viewing and reading) covered about 30% of people’s waking day, with television still, by far, the most dominant media in terms of both penetration and hours of exposure (in line with the double jeopardy law).

A typical viewer of television – who watches only an hour and a half of television a day<sup>84</sup> – is exposed to more than 60 ads. If a typical viewer also reads one magazine or newspaper he or she will be exposed to anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred more ads. Radio and the internet are also cluttered with advertising, and then there is the general background of advertising seen while walking the streets.<sup>85</sup> Therefore, realistically, a person may be exposed to a few hundred advertising messages per day. This is far lower than the level of exposure disseminated by popular mythology, but this level of realistic exposure is still high considering that people don’t live to consume advertising. Attentively consuming all these ads would take three hours out of a person’s waking day!

So each ad has to fight for a tiny piece of attention. How many ads can you recall that you saw or heard this morning? Much advertising receives no active attention whatsoever, or not enough for the receiver to take in which brand is being advertised. Remember the television study mentioned in Chapter 1: a mere 16% of viewers noticed the average commercial and correctly named the advertised brand.

# How consumers cope The typical supermarket stocks around 30,000 products (brands and their variants).
