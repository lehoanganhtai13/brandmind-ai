These books hardly ever disagree with one another. Ironically, they are a very poor example of the differentiation they preach – textbook authors don’t seem to take their own advice.

In spite of nearly every textbook telling marketers to strive for differentiation, real world competition is largely about competitive matching rather than avoiding competitors by delivering differences. Furthermore, textbooks offer no evidence that differentiation leads to brand growth or profitability. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t meaningfully differentiated brands that are growing and profitable, but the empirical fact is that most category leaders have a great many very similar rivals.

Every category has some brands (or variants) that are more expensive and higher quality. Sometimes there are brands that are vastly more expensive – but these up-market brands face many similarly high-priced competitors within their sub-category. Some brands are a bit faster, a tad sweeter, a touch more stylish, slightly trendier or provide a marginally better service. Yet, there is not much difference between them, and it’s surprising how many similar brands a market will support. This leads to two interesting questions[^56]:

1. Can advertising imbue brands with special values? (In other words, can marketing differentiate functionally similar brands?)
2. Do buyers need to perceive a meaningful difference to regularly buy a brand (i.e. to show a preference and/or loyalty)?

The answers to these two questions strike at the heart of much modern marketing thinking and practice. The answers interest both practising marketers and their civic-minded critics. It’s time empirical science was applied to these questions.

# Special values

One explanation for the plethora of rival brands that exist is that advertising has imbued each brand with a different perceived meaning that consumers value.

Marketers routinely measure brand perceptions. Sometimes for very practical reasons, for example, they want to find out how many people know their store is open on Saturday, or whether women perceive them differently to men. However, today it’s common for marketers to measure more esoteric perceptions, like whether consumers imbue the brand with human personality traits.
