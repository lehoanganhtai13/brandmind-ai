It’s not something that should be taken lightly or undertaken often. Each year’s marketing plan should not have a new objective for a new memory structure. Each advertising campaign should largely be saying the same thing. Even when it introduces a piece of new information (e.g. ‘Now in blue’) it should still tell the old story (i.e. work for the brand).

## Rule 5: Create and use distinctive brand assets

Branding matters. Successful businesses have been built by simply introducing branding to a category. For example, Subway recognised that sandwiches were popular throughout the world, and yet there were no branded sandwich shops. What an opportunity sitting under all of our noses! Today, people recognise Subway’s brand when they look down a street or drive past. This recognition allows Subway to out compete the less visible, unbranded sandwich shops (even though many are offering a superior product).

There are three main reasons why distinctive brand assets (descriptive memories) matter. First, branding allows consumers to be loyal to particular brands and to adopt heuristics like buying ‘their brand’ or ‘the one they noticed’. Without branding, loyalty (which is a natural behaviour) has to be directed to something: else – like a price point, a position on the shelf or ‘whatever is on special’.

Second, branding lets consumers know which brand the advertising belongs to so that their memory structures are refreshed for the right brand. Without this, advertising cannot refresh memory structures for a brand (in short, it can’t work). The effect is powerful, with consumers who are more familiar with a brand far more likely to notice the brand’s advertising.

Branding is the creation of distinctive brand assets. Mental associations act like coat-hangers: they allow other memories and associations with a brand to hang or form. iPod’s white headphones (earbuds) are a distinctive asset; even by themselves in any ad they say ‘iPod’. The Jolly Green Giant, the M&M characters, PG Tips’ chimps, the Mercedes Benz 3-pointed star, Nike’s swoosh, Mastercard’s ‘priceless’, L’Oreal’s ‘because you’re worth it’, and Puma’s puma logo all do the same.
