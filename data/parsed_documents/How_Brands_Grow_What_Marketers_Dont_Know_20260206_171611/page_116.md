It is believed that established brands need to maintain their point of difference in order to stay desirable to their customers. Breakthroughs in perceived differentiation – achieved either through product features (e.g. Apple’s original, candy-coloured iMac) or image-building advertising (e.g. Marlboro man) – are seen as pathways to growth.

The marketing literature explicitly states that a brand’s differentiation has to be perceived by customers and must be valued. This valued difference doesn’t have to be a product feature, and can be symbolic or emotional. Some marketing texts even suggest that a brand’s differentiation can be based on what, in reality, are meaningless product features, such as Folgers ‘flaked coffee crystals’ (Carpenter et al 1994) – so long as these features are noticed, believed and valued by consumers. Perception is reality, as many marketing commentators point out. Others like Kotler and Aaker are emphatic that the difference must be meaningful to consumers.

The advertising principle of promoting a ‘unique selling proposition’ (USP) (Reeves 1961) reflects this theory. Advertising that does not give buyers a reason to buy the product is thought to be ineffective. Although, a few have challenged this orthodoxy by arguing that advertising can work effectively without a USP or a means of persuasion (see Chapter 9).

Yet, in spite of these strong beliefs, or perhaps because of them, very little is known about brand differentiation. Consider these questions:

* How different are brands perceived to be?
* Do buyers need to perceive a meaningful difference to repeatedly buy a brand?
* Are some brands far more differentiated than their rivals? Does this mean their buyers are more loyal? Are these brands more profitable? Are they growing faster?

In spite of all the marketing books that preach differentiation, they offer scant evidence to answer these basic questions.

# Real world differentiation

There are very good reasons to doubt the textbook theory of differentiation. Much of the empirical evidence that is presented in this book does not sit well with the theory.
