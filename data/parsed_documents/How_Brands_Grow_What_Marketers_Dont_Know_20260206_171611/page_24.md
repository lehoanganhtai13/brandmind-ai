Today this fundamental research continues at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute at the University of South Australia. There are also plenty of like-minded researchers working inside and outside universities around the world. These efforts receive encouragement and financial support from progressive corporations around the world including Turner Broadcasting, Mars, Colgate, Kraft, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, CBS, ESPN, Mountainview Learning and many others. We are very grateful for this ongoing support.

Many of the findings in this book are emotionally confronting, because they clash with conventional wisdom. In order to make readers feel more psychologically comfortable with this ‘myth busting’ I have attempted to give a good feel for the empirical data[^10] and how the analysis was done. I’ve done this by completely avoiding complicated obscuring statistics and algebra; there are no ‘black box’ (or ‘trust me’) techniques used, and references are supplied so that interested readers can delve further.

There is much potential for science to improve the effectiveness of marketing. The great advances in marketing that will be made this century won’t be due to computers or sophisticated statistics. As in other professions, the real advances will come from the development and application of well established scientific laws (empirical generalisations). On behalf of my colleagues and co-authors I hope you find the new knowledge presented in this book exciting; I hope it also changes the way you see, and do, marketing.
