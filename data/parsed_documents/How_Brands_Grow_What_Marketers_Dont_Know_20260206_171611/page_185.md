McDonald’s is a good example of this. As the twenty-first century-began, McDonald’s growth in developed countries slowed and it was being regularly criticised for selling unhealthy food. While companies like Subway and Starbucks rolled out stores across the world, it looked like McDonald’s marketers were ‘asleep at the wheel’. In hindsight, it was a terrible blunder to have missed the trend towards drinking espresso-based coffee, which hit America fast as it started to catch up with the rest of the developed world. McDonald’s eventually looked outside its stores and saw that people were eating and drinking (a little) better. So they introduced ‘innovations’ like salads, sandwiches, soft chairs and the McCafe, which served proper coffee. The sales results were superb; McDonald’s bounced back. Nothing McDonald’s did was innovative; it was completely a ‘me too’ catch-up exercise, the sort of thing that is frowned upon by marketing texts. My favourite McDonald’s ‘innovation’ in Australia was the introduction of a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich. This is something that is available at nearly every deli and cafe in the country. McDonald’s didn’t do anything radical; it just got competitive again. But thanks to its existing mental and physical availability it can sell a lot of coffee and toasted sandwiches.

Essentially, McDonald’s took away a ‘reason not to buy’, which was undermining its market-based assets. Remember, much of the marketing battle is to get into the usually very small consideration set; when this happens, which is far less often than any marketer would like, the last thing you want to be is rejected for some reason (e.g. it contains trans fat, is too expensive, too salty, the store is too far, Sarah won’t like it).
