Some brands have developed a portfolio of assets that are visual, aural and verbal. Some assets are more flexible than others and are more easily used across different media.

These assets allow a brand’s communication to work. A brand’s distinctive imagery isn’t processed deeply with any great meaning; consumers seldom pause to think about a brand’s logo, name, etc.; certainly not the way that ad agency people do. Let me illustrate this with some examples. Hardly anyone has ever thought about why McDonald’s, an American burger chain, has a Scottish name. In Australia there is a successful food brand called Sanitarium (a name not far off sanatorium). In France, Procter & Gamble don’t translate the brand Head&Shoulders into Tete et Épaules; they use the English brand name. Walker’s crisps dominate the UK potato snack category, while Walker’s shortbread is probably the most famous Scottish shortbread brand, yet no-one ever asks if it is the same company. Few people ask what Nestlé means, or what BMW stands for, or what a name like Fannie Mae has to do with financial services.

A brand’s distinctive devices and sounds are processed very quickly by viewers; they are primarily used for recognition, to help work out what is going on and to assist people’s brains to access and file information. This is why distinctive brand assets work. This is branding.

Third, distinctive brand assets are so important because these descriptive memories facilitate a brand being noticed. We are able to see a brand because we recognise its iconography. Given that even in a retail setting when we are looking for things to buy we still don’t notice most things in the store, distinctive brand assets make a brand salient.

**Table 12.5: Examples of distinctive assets**

This table outlines iconic branding elements associated with three major companies: McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Disney. For McDonald's, key identifiers include the golden arches, sesame seeds on a bun, and the Ronald McDonald clown. Coca-Cola's distinct branding features are its contour bottle, the color red, and a characteristic swirl. Disney's recognizable symbols encompass the castle, Mickey Mouse ears, Tinkerbell, and Pixar's animated lamp. The table presents a comparative structure, highlighting the unique visual and character-based elements that define each brand's identity.

*Rule 6: Be consistent, yet fresh*

A brand can’t be distinctive unless it is consistent.

The potential longevity of brands is considerable. Compared with the lifespan of companies, or the professional lifespan of managers, brands seem immortal.
