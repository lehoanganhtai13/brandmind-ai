Sometimes we have an advantage over many of our competitors and we deliver superior value, but this seldom lasts in competitive markets. Unless we are protected by some government monopoly our competitors notice what we have done and copy us.

Innovation when it works does so by expanding mental and physical availability - and rewards us by letting us earn returns after competitors have nullified our product or price advantage.

# But market research says people buy us because we are [kinder, in tune with women….] ?

Let’s clear up a myth that catches a lot of marketers. Just because some consumers see you as having a particular little difference (e.g. friendlier staff, purpose, ethical stance) doesn’t mean that this is your path to success. Differentiation just doesn’t matter that much.

Say you have a breakfast cereal that has more raisins than other brands. Your market research reports that you achieve somewhat higher (for your brand’s size) on image attributes like “raisins” or “fruity”. And in motivational research consumers who buy your brand say that they do so because they like the raisins. That’s all good and expected. The same can occur if you have spent many years running advertising that stresses raisins. Or it could have been more nuts, or coconut, or fresher ingredients - whatever. Consumers feel like, or remember to feel like more raisins occasionally, just as we sometimes remember we like nuts, and sometimes coconut and so on.

So product features matter but the mistake to make, when looking at your market research, is to think “if only we can get more people to realise that we have more raisins then our brand will grow”. That’s only sort-of-right but not in the traditional marketing theory sense. If you grow mental and/or physical availability then more people will know your brand has more raisins because more people will be buying it more often - so it will be easier for them to remember your brand has more raisins. And easier for them to remember they like raisins. Trying to convince existing buyers that you have more raisins will do little - they already know what the brand is like. Trying to tell non buyers about the raisins is fine, but in this case it’s largely a talking point to win more mental availability - that’s the real driver of growth (not the persuasive effect of the raisins themselves).

Yes you are a bit differentiated, all brands are. But your main marketing battle is to win more mental and physical availability – not to be more differentiated.
