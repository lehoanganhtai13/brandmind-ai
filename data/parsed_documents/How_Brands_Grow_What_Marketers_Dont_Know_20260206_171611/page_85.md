Table 6.4 is a duplication of purchase analysis for the same flavoured milk brands based on the actual buying of the same consumers who provided the data for the perceptual map.

**Table 6.4:** Duplication of purchase – flavoured milk

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically detailing the percentage of buyers of one brand who also purchase other specified brands. The structure is a matrix where rows represent the primary brand purchased by a buyer, and columns indicate the percentage of those buyers who also purchased the brand listed in the column header. For instance, 21% of Farmers' Union buyers also bought Dairy Vale, while 43% of Dairy Vale buyers also purchased Farmers' Union. The diagonal is marked with a hyphen, indicating no self-purchase is being measured. An "Average" row is included, summarizing the average cross-purchase percentage for each brand across all other brands. This highlights inter-brand purchasing relationships and potential brand loyalty or competitive overlap within this market.

The main evident pattern is the duplication of purchase law. The brands are ordered according to market share and it is easy to see that every brand shares about half their customers, during this period, with the largest brand: Farmers’ Union. There is very little customer overlap with the smallest brands: Max and Feel Good.

As far as market partitions, there is one clear partition involving Take Care and Feel Good. These brands share customers to a far higher degree than the duplication of purchase law would predict (see the numbers in bold in Table 6.4). The Take Care and Feel Good products both have zero sugar and low fat – as suggested by their names. These functional differences show up both in duplication of purchase and in the perceptual map.

The perceptual map correctly shows that Take Care and Feel Good are close competitors, but it exaggerates the degree to which these brands are isolated from competition with the other brands. Both these brands still share more customers with the large brand Farmers’ Union than they do with each other – many consumers buy both. In general, perceptual maps often suggest more market segmentation than really exists (Sharp 1997b). This is partly due to the underlying statistical methods, which are designed to highlight differences; these methods are also sensitive to outliers in the data set.

# Implications for brand portfolio management

Should marketers worry if their company has several similar brands? Should these brands be collapsed together, should some be dropped, or should marketers strive to position them differently?
