This data presents a comparative analysis of market share for Cola and Lemonade across various demographic groups. The structure is comparative, highlighting the percentage of market share each beverage holds within distinct segments. Overall, Cola demonstrates a significantly larger market share (40%) compared to Lemonade (13%). This trend generally holds true across most demographic categories, with Cola consistently outperforming Lemonade. Notable variations occur within specific groups: Lemonade shows a higher share among females (14%) than males (11%), and particularly strong performance in the 55-74 years old segment (21%) and households with no children (15%). Conversely, Cola exhibits its highest market share among individuals under 34 years old (45%). The data also breaks down share by household size and socioeconomic status, revealing minor fluctuations but a consistent dominance of Cola across the board.

It’s a common assumption that product variants are developed for particular types of buyers. For example, low-allergy fabric conditioner must sell to people who suffer from allergies. In which case, if we examined such variants we would see ‘niche-type’ patterns: such products would sell to a small group of highly loyal buyers. Yet generally this is not what happens. To use the specific example of (no fragrance, no colour) low-allergy fabric conditioners: these are not big sellers and they sell to a few buyers who only occasionally buy them (double jeopardy; see Chapter 2). Their loyalty metrics are barely higher than they should be as predicted by the double jeopardy law.

What this means is that unscented low-allergy fabric conditioners mainly sell to normal fabric conditioner buyers who occasionally feel allergic (or at least think about it). There will be a few allergy sufferers who only buy low-allergy fabric conditioners, but these few loyalists’ make up a small part of the variant’s customer base.

This data presents a comparative analysis of different customer segments based on their market share, penetration, and loyalty metrics. The primary segments analyzed are "Regular," "Light," and "Unscented," alongside a specific brand, "Stainguard," with an overall "Average" also calculated. "Regular" customers exhibit the highest market share (72%) and penetration (63%), coupled with the highest average purchase frequency (5) and share of category requirements (74%). Conversely, "Unscented" customers represent a smaller segment with lower market share (4%) and penetration (9%), but a notable share of category requirements (28%) despite a lower purchase frequency (2). "Light" customers fall in between, with a 20% market share and 32% penetration, a purchase frequency of 3, and a 33% share of category requirements. "Stainguard" shows a 3% market share and 9% penetration, with a purchase frequency of 1.7 and a 19% share of category requirements. The overall average indicates a purchase frequency of 2.9 and a 39% share of category requirements across all segments. The big discovery is that the customer bases of brands in a category are very similar – except in numbers of buyers.
