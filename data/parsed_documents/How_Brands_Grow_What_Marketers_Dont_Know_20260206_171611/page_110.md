This is why research shows that new customers tend to tell more people about the brand than people who have been buying it for a while (East & Hammond 2005); for established customers, the brand is no longer news. So loyalty and propensity to give word of mouth are not strongly linked. Another myth gone.

# Conclusion

We try to bring our attitudes in line with our behaviour. Since individual brands aren’t very important to us, brand buying tends to have a strong effect on our rather weak attitudes – we like what we buy. Our attitudes reflect the divided nature of our brand loyalty. Attitudes also have a weak reinforcing effect on our current behaviour, so we feel comfortable with our repertoires. Within every brand’s customer base there are a few people who feel much more attitudinally committed to the brand. It may be part of their self-image, used to signal what sort of person they are to themselves and to others. But the marketing consequences of these brand fan(atic)s turn out to be very limited. Most of a brand’s customers think and care little about the brand, but the brand manager should care about these people because they represent most of the brand’s sales; the brand needs these people if it is to increase its sales.

These consumer insights fit, and help explain the discoveries about buying behaviour and the recommendations for brand growth in Chapters 2, 3 and 4.
