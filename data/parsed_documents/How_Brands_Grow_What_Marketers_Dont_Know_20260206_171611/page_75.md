# Implications

One way of thinking about it is that there isn’t a vanilla ice-cream buyer and a different type of person who buys strawberry – there are just ice-cream buyers who sometimes buy vanilla and very occasionally buy strawberry.

When market research shows that a brand is selling to a different customer profile than competitor brands it’s common practice for marketers to say, “We skew towards young women, so that’s our media target.” But this thinking is incorrect. What they should be asking is, “Why? Is there something wrong with our marketing? Are we failing to reach some demographics (and therefore overweighting in others)?” It’s wrong to assume that a brand appeals to a particular type of buyer; most don’t and they shouldn’t want to. A brand may sell to an unusual customer profile (more of some people and less of others) because it is currently marketed that way, or because of history or mistakes. None of which means that it will sell best if targeted to this audience.

A skew from the category norm needs to be checked carefully. The question is whether to market in line with this skew or to go with the category norm. Usually the answer will be the latter.

Of course, there are some expected differences, such as sugary breakfast cereal brands eaten more by children, and expensive products selling to wealthier people (who have sufficient funds to buy them). But within these sub-markets there is little difference between brand’s user bases; for example, Versace sells to the same wealthier buyers as Gucci does.<sup>32</sup>

This is a very positive finding. It means that your brand is unrestrained, in the sense that it can grow its customer base. Because the buyers of other brands are just like your customers – they potentially could be yours. If your buyers were really different from buyers of other brands that would suggest that your brand was suited to a particular type of buyer and not others. That would suggest that you had filled your niche – time for the marketing department to all go home.

But your niche appears to be the whole market, so there is plenty of growth potential. All that is standing in your way is a degree of brand loyalty, and the fact that you have competitors with similar growth aspirations. Of course, this implication also works in reverse.
