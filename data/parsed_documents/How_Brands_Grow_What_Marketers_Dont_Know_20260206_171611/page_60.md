This data presents a distribution of buyers across different percentage brackets, indicating a comparative structure. The primary observation is a sharp decline in buyer percentages as the percentage bracket increases. Specifically, 59% of buyers fall into the 0% bracket, representing the largest segment. This percentage rapidly diminishes to 13% in the 1% bracket and further to 8% in the 2% bracket. The proportion of buyers continues to decrease steadily, reaching 6% for 3% and 4% for 4%. Beyond the 4% bracket, the buyer percentages become progressively smaller, with 3% for 5%, 2% for 6%, and 1% for 7%, 8%, 9%, and 10%. From the 11% bracket onwards, the percentage of buyers drops to 0%, indicating no buyers in these higher brackets. This pattern highlights a concentration of buyers at the lower end of the percentage spectrum.

Sales growth for Colgate, or any brand, won’t come from relentlessly targeting a particular segment of a brand’s or the category’s buyers. Yet this targeting fantasy continues to appear in marketing plans and underpins the use of loyalty ladders and other market research products (e.g. the Conversion Model, ‘super consumers’). This mis-guided fantasy is harming marketing effectiveness.

When marketing succeeds in increasing a brand’s market share, then buying propensities change across the board. This tells us that marketing has the best chance of being successful when it has as much reach as possible. Marketing is particularly successful when it reaches light and non-buyers of a brand.

Therefore, marketing that seeks to increase sales by targeting heavier buyers is unlikely to succeed. Loyalty programs are a classic example of a strategy skewed towards heavier buyers of a brand. These programs are still very popular with marketers; and yet with thousands of such programs running it is difficult to find even a few claiming great success. The serious academic studies report the same finding: loyalty programs generate small or no shifts in market share (see Chapter 11). Price promotions, in contrast, do increase sales, but they are also skewed towards heavier buyers. In spite of a lot of volume being sold on deal, promotions stimulate far less incremental volume (see Chapter 10). Many of the sales would have occurred anyway, to customers who already buy the brand regularly. When the price promotion ends, sales instantly collapse back to their normal level. This is a good example of how difficult it is to bring about sustained growth by targeting only heavy buyers.
