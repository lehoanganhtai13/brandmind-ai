We’ve all been taught that brands vary tremendously in loyalty, with brands like Apple held up as loyalty champions. We’ll investigate Apple’s loyalty levels further in Chapter 7 but for now let’s just look at the discovery that loyalty metrics for competing brands are quite similar.

# Loyalty doesn’t vary much

If you look at marketing metrics (i.e. from consumer panels[^14] run by global market research agencies such as Nielsen and Kantar) you’ll see that the bigger brands have much higher penetrations and they also get bought slightly more often by their buyers – but not much more.

Table 2.2 deconstructs the market shares of major washing machine detergent brands. You can see that all brands are bought by their buyers slightly less often than four times a year. The largest brand, Persil, gets bought almost four times a year. Surf, the smallest, has fewer than half the number of buyers as Persil and these buyers buy Surf around three and a half times a year. This pattern is known as the ‘double jeopardy’ law because smaller brands get ‘hit twice’: their sales are lower because they have fewer buyers who buy the brand less often.

**Table 2.2:** Double Jeopardy Law – washing powder, UK 2005

This data presents a comparative analysis of leading washing powder brands in the UK market as of 2005, illustrating their competitive landscape under the "Double Jeopardy Law" framework. The table details five brands: Persil, Ariel, Bold, Daz, and Surf, alongside their respective market share percentages. It also quantifies their annual market penetration, indicating the proportion of households purchasing each brand within a year. Furthermore, the data provides the average purchase frequency for each brand, offering insight into consumer loyalty and repeat purchasing behavior. Persil leads significantly in market share, followed by Ariel, with the remaining brands holding smaller but still notable positions. The purchase frequencies show a general trend of higher frequency for brands with larger market shares, though minor variations exist.

The next table (Table 2.3) shows a slightly more glamorous category: shampoo. This table is interesting because both the market leader (PG’s Head & Shoulders) and the smallest brand (Wella’s Vosene) are functionally different from the other brands – they are formulated to reduce dandruff. However, this does not substantively affect the double jeopardy law. All the brands get purchased about two times, with the market leaders being purchased slightly more often.
