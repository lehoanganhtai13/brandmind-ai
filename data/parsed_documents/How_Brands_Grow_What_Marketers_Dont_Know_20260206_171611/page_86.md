Should they worry about having brands that “tread on each others toes”? In general, the answer is don’t worry.

Companies often have similar brands that sell to similar populations. Coke has Diet Coke and Coke Zero (and Regular Coke). Mars have the Mars Bar and Snickers. P&G has Tampax and Always. General Motors has Saturn, Astra and Chevy Aveo. This isn’t something to worry about. It’s normal for brands in a category to compete against one another and to sell to near identical customer bases. Even brands that are obviously quite different (e.g. KFC and McDonalds, Visa and AmEx) still directly compete.

Heinz doesn’t worry that it offers tomato soup as well as vegetable soup. Similarly a marketer shouldn’t worry about their company having similar brands. If a new soft drink company could choose to own and market any two global brands, should it choose Coke and Fanta? No, it should choose Coke and Pepsi, because these are the biggest brands globally, with the most valuable market-based assets.

What marketers should worry about is whether or not their brands are distinctive. Are they easy to recognise and distinguish from others? If they are not, the brand’s advertising won’t work – and consumers won’t see the product on the shelf. So brands should look different (this is what branding is about) even if they don’t compete as differentiated brands (see Chapter 8).

Marketers should also worry about the total portfolio effects of price promotions. When one of a company’s brands is on special, this not only takes full-priced sales that would have happened anyway, it also steals full-priced sales from the company’s other brands.

If brands grow they will always steal from the other brands in the same product category. The exact amount of cannibalisation that will occur between brands can be predicted by the duplication of purchase law. What you need to watch out for is excessive cannibalisation. Companies tend to be good at stealing sales from themselves because their brands go through the same sales force, the same distributors, etc. Marketers need to acknowledge and accept this, but to also be on the look-out for excessive cannibalisation.

Finally, the decision to drop, phase out or sell brands should be based on viability, cost and operating issues; not on how similar the brand is to another of the company’s brands. This is especially true if the brands are well established with substantial market-based assets.

# Modern sophisticated mass marketing Markets are usually a little fragmented, but within commonsense definitions they still largely function as mass markets.
