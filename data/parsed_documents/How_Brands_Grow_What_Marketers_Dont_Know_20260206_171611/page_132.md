Before we discuss how advertising works, we look first at the evidence for advertising sales effects (i.e. how advertising nudges buying behaviour). This insight, from marketing science, complements the perspective above. It is a story that has not been told before, yet it provides a deep understanding of how advertising works and why the sales effects are so hard to measure reliably.

# The sales response to brand advertising

The purpose of brand advertising is to affect the buying behaviour of consumers. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. The billions of dollars spent on brand advertising are spent to protect and build sales; logically, this can only happen by affecting buying behaviour and by enhancing and restoring purchase probabilities.

Many people involved in crafting advertising get squeamish with this idea. The reason for this odd behaviour is that they associate sales effects with a limited type of advertising (e.g. “Sale starts this Thursday” and “Crazy discounts – buy now, now, now!”). This sort of advertising often results in observable sales increases, whereas much brand advertising has little or no demonstrable effect on next week’s sales figures. This observation leads to the assumption that advertising does something else other than affect buying. So to justify advertising, marketers invoke concepts such as brand equity, commitment and loyalty, often in a very mystical manner. This makes financial directors and hard-nosed CEOs suspect that the money they spend on advertising is going down the drain.

There is solid empirical evidence that brand advertising does produce sales. Yet the effects of advertising are very difficult to see in sales trends. The reasons for this are not well understood, and this ignorance means that some people who study sales effects (e.g. econometric modelling consultancies and academics) often get their estimates wrong.

There are two reasons why advertising’s sales effects are hard to see in weekly and monthly sales figures (i.e. sales neither jump when advertising starts or increases, nor collapse when it is reduced). The proper effect of advertising on sales is often missed because:

* The aim of most advertising is to maintain market share, that is, to prevent sales from not occurring. Few companies spend enough (or create good enough advertising) to increase market share or accelerate an upwards trend.
