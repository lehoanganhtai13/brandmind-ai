* advertising styles – such as MasterCard’s ‘priceless’ campaign.

A distinctive asset is anything that shows people what brand is being offered for sale. These can be used on packaging and in advertising, in-store displays and sponsorships – they can be used in any marketing activity where the marketer wants the consumer to be able to identify the brand. This might be to build, refresh or reinforce consumer memory structures or to facilitate purchasing by making the brand easier to locate. The stronger and fresher the links between these distinctive elements and the brand name, the easier it is for the consumer to identify the brand. While for packaged goods bought off retail supermarket, pharmacy or hardware shelves this link to the brand name isn’t even necessary. The distinctive asset alone can brand the product.

# Benefits of a distinctive brand

Distinctive brand assets benefit both the marketer and the consumer. A brand loses custom if its potential customers can’t find it. Also, communications are more effective if correctly branded. Much has been written about the cluttered environment, the overload of information due to the greater number of choices available. Distinctiveness reduces the need to think, scour and search – thus making life easier for consumers, without them even realising it. This is a very different consumer benefit from that offered by differentiation, and it has an intrinsic value to the consumer. For example, I value service; therefore I seek a brand that will give fabulous service.

Consumers do not use American Express because they value the colour blue; but seeing the distinctive blue allows people to easily identify that this ad, piece of direct mail, sponsorship is by AmEx (Gaillard, Romaniuk & Sharp 2005).

Unlike ‘meaningful’ differentiation, these qualities can be trade-marked and legally protected (Johnson 1997). It also becomes foolish for a competitor to use the same elements in their advertising, as the advertising is then misattributed to the original brand.

The difference between differentiation and distinctiveness is not just semantics; it is a very real difference that is respected in law.
