Now that is an insight!

The only obvious partition is the premium brands Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen Dazs sharing with each other almost double the amount of customers that they share with other brands; though it is worth observing that Ben & Jerry’s customers are still more likely to buy Carte D’Or than Häagen Dazs. However, the duplication of purchase law has been bent a little, rather than broken.

Marketers often fall into the trap of underestimating how broadly their brand really competes. Segmentation studies overstate very small differences, and it’s assumed that brands with different features (e.g. price levels) must sell to very different people, or for very different buying situations. These assumptions are often unrealistic or exaggerated. It is useful to start the duplication of purchase analysis with a very broad market definition, then if partitions appear, undertake separate duplication analyses, for example, a separate premium ice-cream category and an everyday ice-cream category.

# Potential uses

The duplication of purchase law can be used to find partitions and, therefore, to understand the structure of a market. The law can provide a consumer-buying based guide to define the product category. This can be extremely useful, if only to reduce the debates between managers about category definition. Importantly, it can help prevent the blinkered, production-oriented vision that comes from category definitions based on product features or production processes. These are rife, and are typically too narrow. For example, the chocolate market can be divided into dozens of sub-markets – block, bars, pieces, individually wrapped, candy coated, chocolate coated candy, and so on.

These product-based category definitions can blind managers to their true competitors and prevent them from understanding how customers actually buy.

Ehrenberg-Bass Institute researcher John Bound used to tell a lovely story about when he was a market research manager for Quaker Oats in the UK. At the time research suppliers thought there was a hot breakfast cereal category and a cold breakfast cereal category (among others). Then one day someone pointed out that the cold breakfast cereals still sold well in the middle of (a very cold English) winter. Researchers were immediately sent out into the field to investigate what was going on; they discovered the naughty consumers were putting hot milk on their cold breakfast cereal^38 This example shows that product-oriented category definitions isolate brand managers from real buying behaviour.
