# Physical availability

Physical availability means making a brand as easy to notice and buy as possible, for as many consumers as possible, across as wide a range of potential buying situations as possible. This includes more than retail penetration, but also presence in store. It includes hours of availability, and ease of facilitating the purchase. Being easy to notice and buy is essential, because buyers do not have strong preferences even for the brands they are loyal to; they are happy to buy alternatives from within their personal repertoires (and they regularly do).

There is a double jeopardy law that applies to distribution. An extremely reverse-L-shaped relationship between physical availability and market share has been observed using cross-sectional brand data in multiple countries, and across several categories (Reibstein & Farris 1995) and over time for a single brand that rapidly gained and lost share and distribution (Farris et al 1989). Researchers documenting the law have concluded that higher share brands tend to sell more “per point” of retail distribution than their smaller share rivals – an advantage of scale, bigger brands gain efficiencies. There are two things driving this scale advantage, one is that as brands gain very broad distribution they enter areas where they are stocked alongside very few competitors (e.g. convenience stores, vending machines), so the last points of weighted distribution deliver disproportional share gains. The other reason is similar, larger share and more widely distributed brands also are allocated more shelf space in the stores they are in.

However, there is a far more interesting implication of this empirical law-like pattern. It suggests that while high physical availability is an essential requirement for high market share it does not guarantee market share. What we observe is a large number of brands that suffer low market share (low sales). These brands vary greatly in their physical availability, some are in few stores, while some are in nearly all the stores (particularly all of the ones that sell a lot of their product category). Yet irrespective of their physical availability their sales are low. This suggests they are lacking mental availability, or may be very high price or low quality options with limited appeal.
