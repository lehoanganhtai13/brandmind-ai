This is illustrated in Figure 10.1. There are some obvious spikes in sales that are one-week price specials.

Note that the blue bars represent the baseline or normal level of sales that would have been made anyway if the price promotion had not occurred. These normal sales would have been sold at full price, not a discounted price.

Because the contribution margin is reduced by an exponentially increasing rate from larger discounts, the implication for managers employing price promotions is that they should make them as shallow as possible (e.g. 10% off, not 20% off). Even if this does not result in such high volume increases, at least the volume is making more contribution to profit.

There is another factor that can impinge on the short-term profitability of a price promotion: unit sales may decline immediately afterwards. This can happen because the promotion has induced some consumers to accelerate their purchases. Empirical evidence suggests a trough can occur in sales after a promotion (Mace & Neslin 2004; van Heerde, Leeflang & Wittink 2000). If this happens, the promotion has borrowed some full-price, full-margin sales from the future; this dissipates its potential profitability. Managers should allow for this effect when evaluating promotions.

Finally there is the very likely competitor reaction, that is that they will match promotions in order to maintain their sales. In which case every extra sale you make while on discount represents a future full price sale that will now not occur. This is a very high, and largely forgotten, cost of price promotions.

**Figure 10.1:** Sales for a leading cereal brand

This data presents a series of sales figures for a leading cereal brand, illustrating a clear downward trend. The figures provided are 15.00, 11.25, 7.50, 3.75, and 0. These values represent a progressive decrease in sales, starting from a high of 15.00 and culminating at zero. The structure is a simple, linear progression of quantitative data points, indicating a decline over an unspecified period or across different metrics. The absence of accompanying labels or context within the table suggests these figures might represent sales over time, market share, or some other quantifiable metric where a reduction is being depicted.
