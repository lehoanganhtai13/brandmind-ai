Yet buyers are busier than ever, and many brands are vying for their attention and custom. Forming deep relationships with a substantial number of buyers seems more unlikely than ever. Consequently, it is logical to expect marketers to strive to become better at mass marketing, rather than abandoning it. This is supported by researchers who have been studying patterns in buyer behaviour and brand performance; they have concluded that mass marketing is essential for both brand maintenance and growth.

For decades marketing scientists have been studying buying rates and the statistical distribution of these rates. Buying rates show how many people buy a brand once a year, how many buy it twice, three times and so on. These patterns in these buying rates are rarely taught at business schools but they are used everyday in businesses. These law-like patterns underpin successful sales-forecasting techniques that are used by leaders in this field like BASES, as well as being integrated into some media scheduling models.

Today we know a lot about how often people buy, and how much variation there is between people’s buying. We know that buyers differ from one another in terms of how often they buy and the different brands they buy. We also know how many of each type (weight) of buyer there are. These data provide benchmarks, allow for very useful predictions and deliver great insights. This is a tremendous scientific achievement, and something all marketers should be familiar with.

# Light buyers matter

All brands have many lighter buyers. While these people are only occasional buyers of a brand, there are so many of them that they collectively contribute substantially to sales volume.

It is surprising just how light the typical buyer is. Let’s look at a super big brand in a frequently bought category: Coca-Cola (see Figure 4.1). In many markets, Coke is the market leader by far in the cola category. Data from the Kantar Impulse Panel in the UK (this panel tracks personal purchases, for example, a person buying a can of Coke to drink themself) shows that the average Coca-Cola buyer purchases almost 12 times a year, around once a month. But this average is very misleading, because purchase frequencies show a skewed distribution. The average buyer is not typical. There are some people who buy Coca-Cola morning, noon and night – that’s more than 1000 purchases every year.
