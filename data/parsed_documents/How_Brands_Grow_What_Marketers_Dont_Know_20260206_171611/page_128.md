Until the links between distinctive elements and the brand are learned they cannot function as a substitute for the brand. To successfully teach the link requires a commitment over many years, even decades. For example, the Nike ‘swoosh’ was first introduced in the 1970s; for a long while it was shown alongside the brand name, prior to being used as a solo brand identifier. The strong recognition that the Nike swoosh has today is because of the consistent investment over many decades. A brand can’t be distinctive unless it is consistent.

To build strong, distinctive elements the brand must be consistently communicated to consumers across all media and over time. The importance of consistency has been emphasised by many branding commentators, and particularly by the proponents of integrated marketing communications. They have advocated consistency across campaign elements and media, rather than over time. It’s something of a mystery why some marketers embrace the idea of consistency across media but not consistency across campaigns. And the consistency emphasis has been too much on the brand’s message and positioning, rather than to the visual, verbal or style of branding elements. Consistency in brand identity is something that many brand strategies lack, particularly across campaigns. For example, when a new campaign is created, most of the attention is placed on what is new and fresh. More attention should be placed on making sure the branding elements are similar and consistent; someone who saw the last marketing campaign should understand that the new campaign comes from the same brand. It is only when there is discipline in this consistency that distinctive brand assets build.

In Chapter 4 we saw how all brands have a ‘long tail’ of very occasional buyers; because most of a brand’s buyers rarely buy and rarely think of it, they are easily confused by inconsistent communication and packaging changes.

# A new research focus

While there has been considerable literature on the different elements that could represent distinctive assets, a great deal of this research has been misdirected. It has tried to establish the value of potential distinctive assets to consumers, from a differentiation-style perspective. For example, research into the colours associated with brands often focus on what the colours mean to consumers, or try to identify the best colour for a brand (Bellizzi et al 1983; Grimes & Doole 1998). However, the real value of building strong links to an element such as a particular colour is not that people may like, say blue more than yellow (and so a brand should choose blue over yellow in its packaging, communications, etc).
