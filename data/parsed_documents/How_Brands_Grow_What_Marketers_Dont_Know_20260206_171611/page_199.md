You can improve the quality of the product or service for the same price, but this also negatively affects profit margins. Essentially, these two strategies are similar and not attractive. Everyday brand managers are trying to reduce costs and improve quality to stay competitive – usually that’s about as far as you want to go with this strategy.

The other way to grow a brand is to invest in market-based assets – to improve the brand’s mental and physical availability. However, simply spending more on advertising will have similar results to the strategy above; it will cut your profits and there may be little to show for it afterwards. The trick is to make an investment that builds the brand’s assets, so that in future the marketing budget gets a greater return. That means better advertising and marketing. Building a distinctive memory structure achieves this; it enhances all future advertising (remember it is much easier to refresh existing memories, so advertising for brands that have distinctive elements embedded in people’s minds suffers less from brand ambiguity). Obtaining new physical distribution has a very similar effect; again advertising and other marketing efforts work better if a brand is more widely available.

The third option to stimulate a brand’s growth is to innovate and bring new or improved, desirable features to the marketplace. However, such advantages seldom last long, so it is important to ‘make hay while the sun shines’ and work fast to use the advantage to build penetration and enhance the brand’s market-based assets. New or improved features are something to talk about; they attract attention and generate publicity. Unfortunately, a lot of ‘innovation’ is not exciting or newsworthy.

There is no magic key to growth. It’s difficult because the potential returns are great and all your competitors are trying to grow too (at your brand’s expense). But you are much more likely to succeed when it’s understood that the key objective is to build its market-based assets. The brand must be easier to buy for more people in more situations. Market penetration is a good proxy measure for these assets, and so worth monitoring as a key metric. It’s better than overall sales, because sales can be distorted by price promotions and other efforts that target your heavier, existing consumers.

Growth is possible – all the laws of marketing in this book support this – and it doesn’t just depend on new products. Better advertising, better branding, better media strategy, better in-store displays by following the seven rules presented above – these are all paths to growth.
