# Chapter 8:  
## Differentiation Versus Distinctiveness

Byron Sharp & Jenni Romaniuk

----

Rather than striving for meaningful, perceived differentiation, marketers should seek meaningless distinctiveness. Branding lasts, differentiation doesn’t.

### Thou Shalt Differentiate

Textbooks emphatically tell marketers that differentiation must be the centrepiece of their marketing strategy:

> “if marketing is seminally about anything it is about… differentiating … All else is derivative of that and only that” (Theodore Levitt)  
> “differentiation is the cornerstone of successful marketing” (Philip Kotler)  
> “the differentiation must be meaningful to customers … if a brand fails to differentiate then consumers have no basis for choosing it over others” (David Aaker)  
> “without differentiation a loyal customer base cannot be created or sustained” (David Aaker)  

All of the above quotes are wrong.  
As is this one: “Differentiate or die” (Jack Trout)  

Practically every university marketing textbook is called something like *Marketing Management* or *Marketing Principles*, while almost every consumer behaviour textbook has the title *Consumer Behaviour*. The chapter headings in these books are also strikingly similar.
