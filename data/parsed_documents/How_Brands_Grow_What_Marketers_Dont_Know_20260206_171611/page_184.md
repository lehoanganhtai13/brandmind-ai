These assets can be sold, and they are generally worth far more than a corporation’s tangible assets. Mental and physical availability, and the brand’s distinctive iconography (discussed in Chapter 8) are assets that can be sold. They are brand equity.

These are market-based assets, in that they come about through trading activity. They are created by marketing. They are assets because they cost money to build, and other companies may purchase them rather than spending the money and time (and taking the risk) to build their own. They are valuable because they provide some surety of future profit.

These market-based assets deliver productivity. Advertising works better when there are existing memory structures in viewers’ heads – so long as the advertising works with these memory structures. Advertising also works better when the brand has plenty of physical availability. Advertising falls on barren ground when it reaches consumers who aren’t near a brand’s sales points.

To corporations (and their investors), these market-based assets provide security – next year’s sales will be not too dissimilar to this year’s. This is very valuable, though it also creates problems in evaluating marketing actions. Every action is moderated by these assets, so marketplace reactions become sluggish. We see this in price elasticities where larger brands have lower elasticities (see Chapter 10); it’s the same for other marketing stimulus like advertising; it’s harder to see anything happening when you turn it on and off. For particularly large, old brands like Snickers (launched in 1930), what they are doing this month advertising-wise pales into insignificance compared to its established mental and physical availability.

To clearly see or statistically model the effects of a marketing strategy, look at a small brand with little mental and physical availability. In particular, this will show a nice, neat sales reaction to increasing distribution. Measuring marketing is less simple for established brands. 95

When marketing support has been absent for a long time for a brand that retains considerable market-based assets, tremendous gains can be made by sprucing up the marketing mix – particularly mental availability in the minds of consumers and retailers. This is one way to make your fortune: find a brand that was popular, with substantial mental and physical availability, but that has been neglected and so has lost much market share. Fix the product quality, or lower the price, start advertising again, and if necessary, work to regain breadth and depth of distribution.
