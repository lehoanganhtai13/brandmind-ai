Nor to convince more consumers that raisins are better than nuts, or fruit, or chocolate, or whatever is in other brands. Never lose sight of the big picture. Raisins just don’t matter that much (nor does almost any claim you can make).

This lesson is largely lost among services providers like hotels, retail stores, banks, and travel agents. They are very enamoured by the idea that if they can offer better service than rivals they will enjoy astonishing loyalty and huge market share gains. There is nothing wrong with striving to improve service, indeed it’s almost essential just to prevent slipping behind, but we need to be realistic about the small potential gains.

# Seven simple rules for marketing

The purpose of science is to simplify the enormously complex world we live in; to allow us to glimpse some of its regularities; to give us the power of prediction; and to provide insight into why things are the way they are.

The marketing world is extraordinarily complex, but textbooks fail us when they suggest that this complexity can never be mastered. As we’ve seen, there are regularities in buying behaviour and sales performance. So it is possible to come up with some simple rules for ‘branded competition for sales’ (i.e. competition to build a sales base with considerable lasting capability). This is, almost without exception, competition between brands (entities whose sales are underpinned by both mental and physical availability). [^96]

Within this area there are strategic guidelines:

1. Continuously reach all buyers of the brand’s service/product category, with both physical distribution and marketing communication.  
2. Ensure the brand is easy to buy.  
3. Get noticed. Often.  
4. Refresh and build brand-linked memory structures that make the brand easier to notice and buy.  
5. Create distinctive communication assets.
