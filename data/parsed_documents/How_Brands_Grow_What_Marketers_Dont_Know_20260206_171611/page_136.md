Any marketing intervention, if it succeeds, works by increasing the probability that customers will purchase a product. Successful advertising reaches and affects many consumers. It reaches all types of consumers, not just the ones who are easy to reach (i.e. a brand’s heavy, regular buyers, who easily notice the brand’s advertising because their brand-related mental structures are better developed and they are less likely to screen out the advertising).

Successful advertising, in particular, reaches the millions of consumers who have a very low probability of buying a brand next week or month. If a brand’s advertising reaches them, if they notice it, if it refreshes or builds the memory structures that make the brand more likely to be noticed or come to mind in a buying situation (i.e. enhancing mental availability), then it nudges their propensity to buy the brand. This is the sales effect. But most of these additional sales won’t show up in this week’s sales figures because hardly any of these consumers will buy this week; they simply don’t buy that often even with their newly enhanced propensity. Indeed, most of these extra sales will never show up as part of a lift in overall sales because, before the consumer even buys from the category, he or she will be hit with competitor advertising (or other marketing activity) that nullifies the effect of the advertising exposure. But this doesn’t mean that the sales effect didn’t happen; that nudge in propensity protected the brand’s sales from the effect of competitor activity. Instead of the competitor’s ad winning extra sales it merely got the brand back to where it had been before (see Danaher, Bonfrer & Dhar 2008).

Consider people who, after being exposed to a Coke ad, increase their propensity to buy Coke tomorrow from 1-in-300 to 2-in-300. This means they will now make a purchase every 150 days, rather than once every 300 days. So these extra purchases still take a long while to occur. This is the meaning of advertising’s sales effects being spread thinly over time.

The reach of price promotions is very different. Their reach is very restricted as it’s skewed to heavier, more regular buyers of a brand. Also, the sales effects of price promotions aren’t spread out in time. In-store promotions only affect those people buying from the category in the week of the promotion. So the entire sales effect shows up in that week’s sales figures[^71]. That’s why price promotions show clear effects: sales increase immediately when price promotions are turned on, and sales decrease immediately when they are turned off.
