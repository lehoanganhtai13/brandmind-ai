### Are buyers puppets?

Nike is routinely held up as a super brand, but its sales and style are similar to Adidas. The sportswear market has a plethora of similar competing brands (Reebok, Puma, New Balance and Coq Sportif)<sup>40</sup>; one explanation for this brand proliferation is that marketers have used advertising and packaging to fool buyers into adopting irrational preferences and loyalties. This explanation has been put forward by both opponents and advocates of advertising and branding. There are plenty of psychological studies that support this argument, but they also suggest advertising and packaging have a very weak psychological effect (even under laboratory conditions).

Two widely reported (and misreported) psychological studies are typical. Each purports to show that branding can massively distort preferences. In one study (McClure et al. 2004) 16 of the subjects undertook blind taste tests and about half chose Pepsi and half chose Coke. Their choice in the blind tests correlated poorly with the preference they stated prior to the test: about the same number of those who had stated they preferred Coke chose Pepsi in the blind trial, and about the same number of subjects who preferred Pepsi chose Coke.

Other subjects were each given two samples of the same cola. One sample was identified as either Coke or Pepsi, while the brand of the other sample was not revealed – subjects were told that the second unidentified cola could be either Coke or Pepsi (though in reality it was always the same cola as the first sample).<sup>41</sup> When the labelled cola was Coke, subjects largely said it tasted best. The same did not occur when Pepsi was the identified cola. This may have been due to the groups consisting of more people who usually tend to drink Coca-Cola (prior preferences were not checked, or at least not reported).
