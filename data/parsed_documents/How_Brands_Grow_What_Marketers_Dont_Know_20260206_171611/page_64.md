Nearly 50 years later a series of vastly more comprehensive studies were undertaken examining the profiles of the customer bases of competing brands. These studies profiled hundreds of brands, across dozens of categories (from cigarettes to computer games to mortgages) over time (Hammond, Ehrenberg & Goodhardt 1996; Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Kennedy, Ehrenberg & Long 2000, Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2001a; Kennedy & Ehrenberg, 2001b). Just as importantly, the studies used hundreds of variables capable of describing buyers: demographics, psychographics, attitudes, values and media habits. The key discovery of these studies is that competing brands sell to the same sort of people. Within each brand’s customer base there is a lot of variation (i.e. different types of people), but each brand has the same variation.

Table 5.1 presents car ownership data from a different decade (1990s), but still the same pattern is clear. The customer bases of these UK car brands are quite similar to each other – even in the newspapers they read. Rover buyers, in spite of driving an up-market brand, still read the tabloid newspaper, the Sun, far more than they read the more intellectual newspaper, the Telegraph. This is also true for the owners of all the other car brands, and reflects the fact that the Sun is considerably more popular than the Telegraph. The greatest difference in the customer base is household size. This reflects the fact that larger households buy brands of cars that are physically bigger (more seats with a larger boot). Sierra and Cavalier are somewhat physically larger vehicles.

**Table 5.1:** Car brands sell to similar types of people, UK 1990s

This data presents a comparative analysis of owners across five car models: Rover, Escort, Sierra, and Cavalier, alongside an overall average. The comparison focuses on demographic and media consumption characteristics. For each car model and the average, the data details the gender distribution of owners, showing a slight male majority across the board. Household size is also broken down, distinguishing between smaller (1-2 people) and larger (2+ people) households, with a general trend towards smaller households, though the average indicates a near-even split. Finally, the data quantifies the percentage of owners who read specific newspapers, the "Sun" and the "Telegraph," revealing a significantly higher readership of the "Sun" compared to the "Telegraph" across all car models and the average.

The similarities in the customer bases include the values that the different car owners hold. Table 5.2 shows a delightful collection of consumer values. Respondents may be fibbing when 98% of them say they don’t judge people by the car they drive but, if so, your honesty doesn’t depend on the brand of car you drive.
