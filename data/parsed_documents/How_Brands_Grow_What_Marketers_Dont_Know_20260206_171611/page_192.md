In her doctoral work Rachel showed that, in general, ads that were better liked were also more likely to be correctly branded (certainly not less as many advertising agencies assert). She replicated Erik’s COMMAP as a model to explain ad liking (see Figure 12.1).

We also know that brand usage has a powerful affect on ad liking, and also affects noticing. This fits with the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance; it also fits with the concept of mental availability that we are better able to process things if they relate to established memory structures (see Rule 4 below); and it fits with extensive research showing that we have implicit and explicit memory. Explicit memories are the memories we are able to retrieve into our consciousness, like remembering that yesterday we went to the beach. Implicit memories can’t be recalled like this, but evidence of their existence shows up implicitly, such as in test performance. For example, people who are exposed to a statement, even if they can’t remember it, are more likely to rate that statement as true than people not previously exposed to the statement. It also shows how we favour the familiar and shows how memory affects our behaviour even when we don’t realise it. Even consumers standing in front of supermarket shelves where all the brands are clearly displayed are being powerfully affected by memories – which brands they actually see is affected by memories. This means we may notice a brand on the shelf, and feel slightly more positive about it, simply because we have seen it more (or its advertising more) without the slightest realisation that this has happened.
