Partitions exist in markets; premium quality/price partitions are particularly common. But it is sensible to think of these divisions as sub-markets (partitions) rather than as entirely separate markets.

# Positioning and partitioning

This story of customer overlap is at odds with the picture provided by perceptual maps (and other brand image analyses). This picture is usually of some brands competing closely with each other, and very indirectly with other brands in the competitive set. A typical perceptual map might look like Figure 6.1 (the brands are marked in circles).

**Figure 6.1:** Perceptual map – flavoured milk

This table presents a comparative analysis of different brands, likely beverages, based on various attributes. The central axis appears to differentiate brands based on their target demographic and perceived qualities, with "low fat, healthy, new, unpopular, nutritious, minor brand, women, beautiful people" representing one cluster of attributes. Contrasting this are attributes like "working class, hangover cure, hi caffeine" associated with the "Max" brand, and "fresh, ugly people" linked to the "FU" brand. Further distinctions are made with "yuppie brand" and "premium brand" attributes, alongside "fattening" and "childrens brand" associated with "DV". The "sweet" attribute is also noted, suggesting a taste dimension. The structure is comparative, highlighting how different brands are positioned across a spectrum of consumer perceptions and product characteristics.

This correspondence analysis (see Bendixen 2003) based perceptual map for flavoured milk (iced coffee) in Australia implies there are very significant market partitions. The brand Max is for working-class males; Farmers’ Union is mainstream and devoid of a brand ‘image’; Dairy Vale is a children’s brand, or perhaps is sweet and luxurious; while Feel Good and Take Care are new, healthy brands for women. However, duplication of purchase analyses have shown that market partitions are generally due to substantial functional differences and similarities between brands, factors like where or when they are physically available, rather than their brand images.
