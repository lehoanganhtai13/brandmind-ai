There are two criteria that make some branding assets worth more than others. These two criteria are:  
* fame - how many people associate the brand with that asset  
* uniqueness - of those people how many only associate that brand with the asset  

This assessment must come from consumer research<sup>67</sup>. Marketers and agencies tend not to research and, therefore, they massively over-estimate the strength of their distinctive assets. In turn, this leads to both overestimating the degree of branding that really exists in advertising copy and overestimating how easy a brand is to notice on shelf. We can’t stress enough how important these errors are. It is a very fundamental failure for a marketer not to have carefully market researched their brands’ distinctive assets.  

The purpose of building strong, distinctive assets is to increase the number of stimuli that can act as identification triggers for a brand. Distinctive assets improve advertising effectiveness by making it more likely that viewers will correctly identify which brand the advertising belongs to. In a shopping environment, distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice and purchase a brand.  

It is important that each distinctive element is uniquely linked to its brand. If consumers also think of competitors when prompted with that element, then the element fails to act as a brand name substitute. If a shared, distinctive element is substituted for the brand name, the risk is that consumers will think of a competitor rather than the target brand. The second criterion for considering an element to be a distinctive asset is that it is prevalent. This means that the majority of consumers link the brand to the element. A distinctive element that is unique, but unknown, cannot act as a substitute for the brand name because most people who encounter it will not think of the brand name.  

The purpose of building strong, distinctive assets is to increase the number of stimuli that can act as identification triggers for a brand. Distinctive assets improve advertising effectiveness by making it easier for viewers to identify which brand the advertising belongs to. In a shopping environment, distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice, recognise and therefore purchase a brand.
