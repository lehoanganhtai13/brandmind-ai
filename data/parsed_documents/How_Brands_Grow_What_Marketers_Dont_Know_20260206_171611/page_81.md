There are three striking patterns in the above table:

1. Every brand shares much more of its customer base with the largest brand, Carte D’Or, than with Mars, the brand with the smallest market share.

2. There is similarity in the degree of sharing with any particular brand. For example, all brands share 40% of their customers (+ or - only a few percentage points) with Carte D’Or during the period of analysis.

3. There are a few deviations to the first two patterns. For example, Ben Jerry’s shares more than expected with Häagen Dazs.

The first two patterns reflect what is known as the duplication of purchase law. This law says that all brands, within a category, share their customer base with other brands in line with the size of those other brands. In other words, everyone shares a lot with big brands and a little with small brands.

The duplication of purchase law would not hold if several brands successfully targeted exclusive customer bases, or particular types of people who are different from the buyers of other brands<sup>37</sup>. However, as we saw in Chapter 5, rival brands sell to very similar customer bases.

In Table 6.3 the brands are ranked in market share order, both across columns and rows, so you can easily see that the duplication of customers declines in line with this rank. Every brand shares most with Carte D’Or because it is the largest brand – it has about three times the penetration of most of the other brands in the table.

Armed with knowledge of the duplication of purchase law, it is possible to spot market partitions: clusters of brands whose customer bases overlap more than expected. The law can also be used to spot brands that show unusually low overlap in their customer bases.

The ice-cream buying data covers premium and not-so-premium brands, brands only sold in large tubs and brands only sold as bars/cones. This affects their distribution, as some outlets only stock large tubs and some only stock small bars/cones. Given these notable functional differences we should expect a partitioned market. The real surprise is how unpartitioned it is; in other words, the market is not far off being one mass market.
