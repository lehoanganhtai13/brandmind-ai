A significant amount of brand management time is spent developing huge batteries of highly subjective perceptual cues to measure. 57

The data that such image (brand health/equity) surveys generate are often subjected to multivariate statistical techniques, or the even more obscure proprietary analyses that many market research agencies peddle. These are typically designed to highlight differences between brands, but usually fail to convey how big these differences really are – or how they relate to actual buying behaviour. By now this might strike you as odd (and not good practice), given that we saw previously (in Chapter 5) that buyers of one brand perceive that brand in much the same way as buyers of rival brands perceive their brand – the ‘I love my mum’ pattern.

Bigger brands have many more customers (see Chapter 2), and so they have more people who are likely to respond to an image survey question. Consequently, larger brands tend to score higher on any image question, because they will have more customers among the survey respondents. Their buyers are also slightly more loyal (i.e. they buy more frequently), which enhances their propensity to think/say things about the brand. So, even in survey data that only reports on the perceptions of each brand’s buyers, brands with larger market share will score higher.

To understand if a brand really is perceived differently by the market you have to remove this usage (i.e. more buyers) effect. What is not well known – or is rarely discussed by market researchers – is that once the usage effect is removed there is little sign of brands having unique images. For example, Table 8.1 lists the percentage of respondents (who are familiar with a brand) who associate a brand (e.g. FedEx) with a particular image attribute (e.g. trusted). This data was published in a market research journal (Whitlark & Smith 2001) to show how complicated image data are supposed to be. However, Professor Martin Collins (2002) subsequently showed that if you are familiar with the law-like patterns you can ‘see the wood for the trees’ without complicating things with multivariate statistics. In Table 8.1, brands are simply ranked in order of the number of respondents who were familiar with them, it’s only a rough proxy for usage, yet the ranking still produces the sort of patterns seen when only users of each brand have their perceptions measured. These main patterns are:

* Some attributes always score higher than others (e.g. more than 90% for ‘trusted’ compared with only 30% for ‘essential’). 58
* All brands gain very similar scores – with a slight double jeopardy sub-pattern (i.e. smaller brands score slightly lower).
