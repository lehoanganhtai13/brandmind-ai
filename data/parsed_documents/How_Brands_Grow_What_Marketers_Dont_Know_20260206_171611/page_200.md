# A fine future for marketing

Few marketing departments see themselves as custodians of the precious market-based assets of mental availability and physical availability – at least not yet. While it is commonplace to talk about building strong brands (rather than short-run sales), brand managers have little specialist knowledge about building and managing these assets, and rarely if ever do they have comprehensive metrics covering mental and physical availability. Their efforts are seldom judged against such metrics. Considerable time is wasted on esoteric quackery concerned with segmentation, differentiation and how buyers perceive brands (e.g. brand personality).

However, as more brand managers realise how brands really compete, their attention should turn towards activities that build mental and physical availability. Their attention will then shift to branding, media strategy and distribution – there is a great deal of research, development and experimentation that needs to be done in these areas to improve marketing effectiveness.

Marketing today largely functions as a specialist part of the production department; it produces advertising and promotions rather than experimenting and learning about strategy. Development of specialist knowledge of these market-based assets should lead to greater respect for marketing as a crucial function of business. It is a significant opportunity because no other part of the organisation measures and therefore can claim to manage these intangible assets. The same cannot be said for other areas of a business, such as product development, customer service and pricing.

The future for marketing departments and for consumer brands is bright – if they adapt to the more complex and media-fragmented world we live in; if they become sophisticated mass marketers working with the empirical laws of marketing; and if they reject ‘anything goes’ lawless marketing strategy.
