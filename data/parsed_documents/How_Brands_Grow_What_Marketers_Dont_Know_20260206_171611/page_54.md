In our Coca-Cola example, there are plenty of cola buyers who buy themselves a Coca-Cola only a few times a year, and a smaller group who buy much more regularly (once a week or daily or more). This results in a very typical Pareto share (closer to 50% than 80%).

In contrast, there are categories where buyers are more homogeneous. For example, most people fill their car with petrol once a week. There is a tiny group of people who don’t own a car, yet who occasionally buy fuel when they hire a car – but only a few of these people show up in a period of analysis. There are some other people who drive a lot, and fill up twice, maybe three times a week. But the vast majority of people buy petrol once a week (and even the heavy buyers don’t buy significantly more than this), so buying rates aren’t polarised and the Pareto share is not very extreme.

The Pareto share metric depends on the time period of study (Schmittlein, Cooper & Morrison 1993). In a very short time period all the people who have bought the brand will have bought at a very similar rate; for example, in a week almost everyone who has bought has done so just once, perhaps a few have bought twice, in which case the heaviest 20% of buyers will be responsible for about 20% of sales (say 25/20). As time goes by the heaviest buyers reveal their true colours and show how much more frequently they buy the brand. Also, larger numbers of very light buyers enter the analysis window by buying the brand just once. This increases the polarisation between heavy and light buyers – giving a more extreme Pareto share metric.

Our research (Sharp & Romaniuk 2007) of many dozens of brands, across product categories, shows that over a three-month period a ‘fast-moving consumer good’ brand will typically have a Pareto share of only 35%. Over a year this metric will have risen to over 50%, usually not far over 50% and rarely anything like the proverbial 80%.

Another way of putting this is that the lightest half of buyers deliver only 20% of volume, leaving the heavy half to deliver the other 80%<sup>23</sup>. Which can be summed up by Professor Gerald Goodhardt’s 20:30:50 law, which states that the 20% heaviest buyers account for 50% of purchases (proved true in Sharp & Romaniuk 2007), the 50% lightest buyers account for 20% of purchases, and so the middle 30% of buyers account for 30% of purchases. In short, 20:30:50 buyers accounting for 50:30:20 purchases.

Table 4.1 shows that brands within a category have a similar Pareto share. This doesn’t vary a great deal between categories. Table 4.2 contains 2007 Nielsen BrandScan data reporting the average Pareto shares for brands in a selection of US product categories.
