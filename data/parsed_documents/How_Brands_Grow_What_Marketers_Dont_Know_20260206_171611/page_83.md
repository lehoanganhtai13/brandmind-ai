Even consumption situation-based category definitions (e.g. for snacking, for sharing, for gifting) commonly result in artificial overly narrow category definitions. The reality is that few brands are exclusively bought for specific consumption situations, and which brands are bought for which situation varies between consumers and over time.

Narrow category definitions lull brand managers into a false sense of security and can result in unduly conservative growth targets. Brand managers prefer category definitions that make their brand appear to have a substantial market share – no one like to be ranked seventeenth. Therefore, narrow category definitions are commonly adopted. These also make growth potential, particularly penetration potential, appear more limited than it really is.

In addition to giving guidance regarding category definition, and showing which brands compete with which, the duplication of purchase law can also be used to predict where new brands will steal sales from. In this way the law can be used to estimate cannibalisation of sales of sister brands. This is essential for planning the launch of a new product.

The duplication of purchase law also shows up in customer defection and acquisition. A brand will gain most of its new customers from the largest brands, and will also lose more of its customers to larger brands. Therefore, the law can be used as benchmark for customer defection and acquisition to and from each of a brand’s competitors. For example, if a brand is losing more customers to another brand than you would expect given that brand’s size, then this indicates some unusual overlap in marketing strategy (perhaps the competing brand has opened a store close by?).

# Marketing strategy insight

Duplication of purchase analysis does more than show who competes against whom. The fact that there is such a natural law (that describes sharing in most categories rather well) tells us about how brands compete in general. We live and work in a world of mass markets. Ben Jerry’s and Häagen Dazs, while they are close competitors, also compete against all other ice-cream brands, especially large ones like Carte D’Or. Such patterns hold around the world and in different product/service categories. For example, customer gains for BMW in France come more from large non-premium brands like Renault, Citroën and Peugeot than from smaller luxury brands like Mercedes and Audi (Ehrenberg 1999).
