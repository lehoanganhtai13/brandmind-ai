Professors Lars Meyer-Waarden and Christophe Benavent (2006) replicated the Ehrenberg-Bass research using the AGB Behavior Scan panel in France. They examined the effect of four supermarket loyalty programs and they too observed weak and inconsistent effects. Leenheer and colleagues (2007) used a different approach (a one-off statistical model) to control selection effects (i.e. that the most loyal consumers join a brand’s loyalty program). Their study of Dutch supermarket loyalty programs also found very small loyalty effects. Another Dutch researcher (Verhoef 2003) found small, positive effects on retention and share in the financial services market; however, Verhoef acknowledged that the longitudinal design of his study didn’t fully account for the selection effects. It is a consistent story. Loyalty programs produce very slight loyalty effects, and do practically nothing to drive growth. The consequent effect on profits is presumably negative.

# Why don’t loyalty programs work better?

The answer lies in the fact that from a marketing strategy perspective there is something unusual about loyalty programs: they skew, more than other marketing interventions, towards heavier, more loyal buyers of the brand. This selection effect occurs for two reasons. The first is physical and mental availability: it is easier for more loyal buyers to notice the loyalty program and to join. This is particularly true of retail loyalty programs where usually the only way of joining is to sign up in-store; more regular shoppers have a statistically (much) higher chance of joining due to chance exposure. The second reason is the economic incentive to join, which is much stronger for already loyal buyers who can see that they will be rewarded for doing what they already do – getting ‘something for nothing’ is an attractive deal.

Essentially, consumers who rarely buy a brand (or shop in a particular store) don’t see the loyalty program – and if they do they can’t see the point in joining. This substantially restricts the reach of loyalty programs, and hence limits their capacity to drive substantial growth. There is also the question of what effect the loyalty program has on those consumers who it does reach (i.e. consumers who join the program and remember to participate). Logically, this effect will not only depend on the strength of the loyalty program, but also on which particular consumers the loyalty program recruits.
