And the IPA Effectiveness Awards results remind us that it is a much better strategy to go with the law than against it. Jim Nyce, previously Insights Director at Kraft, describes this as ‘swimming downstream’. An analysis (led by Frank Cotignola) by his Consumer Insight & Strategy department showed that 56% of their brand plans were trying to ‘swim upstream’ by raising purchase frequency, while an internal study of the growth and decline patterns of 67 Kraft brands showed that penetration was the dominant driver of sales and share, in line with the double jeopardy law.

# What about niche brands?

The term ‘niche’ is used loosely in marketing; often it is used simply to mean small.[15] This turns out to be appropriate because most niche brands are small. Technically, a niche brand in a category should, for its market share, have an unusually small base of buyers who are unusually loyal.[16] If every category had a number of these brands, and/or their differences truly were substantial then the double jeopardy pattern wouldn’t exist. There are far fewer niche brands than people expect, and they are less niche than we think.

Nor is being niche necessarily a good thing. Rather than thinking of niche brands as having excess loyalty more are best thought of as having less penetration (and market share) than we’d expect given their loyalty levels. This penetration deficit is usually due to some lack of availability, such as being missing from a particular distribution channel (e.g. retail private labels are completely missing from rival store chains), or missing in a particular geographical area. This penetration deficit may also be due to lack of mental availability amongst part of the buying population, for instance, because of their lack of advertising some private labels are simply not thought of or noticed by some customers – more people than expected given their market share. Similarly differentiated brands may be rejected by part of the buying population while the rest value the differentiation – Spanish language TV channels in the US are an example. They are not watched by those who don’t speak Spanish but watched for many hours by those that do. Whatever the reason a brand’s lack of penetration is rarely something to boast about.

# What about cross-selling?

Another route to sales growth is to encourage current customers to buy different products. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems and loyalty programs often promise this benefit. It’s widely viewed that this is an easy path to growth: that is, you already have a relationship with these buyers, so if they are made a good offer they should take it up.
