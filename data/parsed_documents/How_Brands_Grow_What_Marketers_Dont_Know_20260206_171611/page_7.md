This table outlines key strategic considerations for brand management and marketing. It emphasizes that differentiating a brand is a crucial marketing task, with loyalty metrics reflecting brand strength rather than its market size. The data suggests that customer retention is more cost-effective than customer acquisition, and price promotions are more effective at increasing market penetration than building customer loyalty. The competitive landscape is influenced by brand image positioning, and mass marketing is presented as no longer competitive. Furthermore, the table highlights the importance of understanding customer motivations, noting that buyers have specific reasons for choosing a brand and that consumers can be characterized as a distinctive group. Finally, it points to a common Pareto principle in customer behavior, where the heaviest 20% of customers contribute at least 80% of sales.

This table contrasts a "Past World View" with a "New World View," suggesting a shift in marketing and communication strategies. The past view focused on "Positioning" and "Differentiation," aiming for "Message Comprehension" through "Unique Selling Propositions" and "Persuasion" by engaging "Rational involved viewers." The emphasis was on clearly defining a product's place and advantages. In contrast, the new view prioritizes "Salience" and "Distinctiveness," aiming for "Getting noticed, emotional response" and fostering "Relevant associations." This approach seeks to build and refresh "memory structures" through "Reaching" rather than solely "Teaching," acknowledging that audiences are often "Emotional distracted viewers." The structure is comparative, highlighting a transition from a rational, feature-driven approach to an emotional, attention-grabbing one.

Decades of research into how buyers buy and how brands compete has led to these surprising conclusions:

1. Growth in market share comes by increasing popularity; that is, by gaining many more buyers (of all types), most of whom are light customers buying the brand only very occasionally.
2. Brands, even though they are usually slightly differentiated, mainly compete as if they are near lookalikes; though they vary in popularity (and 3.
