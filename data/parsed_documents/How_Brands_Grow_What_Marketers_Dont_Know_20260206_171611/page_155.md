Also, the larger competitor brand B is, the bigger the effect. Therefore, setting the price of a brand slightly below that of the biggest brands in the category may be a better tactic than either deeply undercutting the leaders’ prices, or setting the price close to the leader’s price, but not undercutting it.

## 2) If the price change is explicitly signalled

Signalling the price change has a big effect. The signalling effect links to the notion that consumers have imperfect awareness of prices and their relativities. Therefore, if we draw attention to a price cut (e.g. ‘was $54 now $30’), more people will be aware of the price and act on it. Also, of course, consumers like a bargain. Many studies of the effect of in-store price signals such as signage and displays can result in massive, short-term gains in sales. If a price cut is accompanied by in-store advertising, sales can increase by as much as 400% (Woodside & Waddle, 1975). In the UK, Hamilton, East and Kalafatis (1997) reported that price cuts coupled with additional promotional support can increase sales by around 200-500%. Totten and Block (1994, p. 70) reported that a deep price cut of 45%, supported by feature or display advertising, can increase sales by approximately 280% and possibly as much as 400%.

## 3) If the brand’s share is low

Big brands have smaller price elasticities; small brands have bigger elasticities. This is an arithmetic effect, a result of elasticity being calculated using percentages. It is easy to imagine a brand moving from a 2% to a 6% market share (e.g. with a 50% price cut, this would require an elasticity of -4). The same elasticity and price cut on a brand with a 30% market share could enlarge the brand’s share to 90%, which is almost impossible to achieve. This difference in elasticity means small brands can enjoy bigger uplifts from promotions, but suffer more than big brands when they increase prices. Conversely, bigger brands find it harder to get really big proportional sales rises from promotions, but suffer a little less than small brands when they put prices up.

## 4) If the price is increased from its normal level

It is often assumed that elasticity is the same for price rises as cuts, but there is no reason why this should be so. Empirical results from a series of experiments (Scriven & Ehrenberg 2004) show that price increases have a bigger effect on volume than cuts do – if we consider the sole effect of a price change, divorced from extra effects of signalling or in-store support.
