Most advertising exposures fail these two hurdles, so the money spent is wasted, or worse, the ad refreshes memories for competitor brands. As discussed in Chapter 1, less than 20% of television advertisements are both noticed and correctly branded (i.e. there is over 80% wastage). This is shocking; it’s alarming enough to think that large corporations would have a special task force, perhaps within marketing, that was charged with eradicating this problem. This task force would conduct research and development, set guidelines and cultivate techniques for developing and evaluating advertising to ensure that all a brand’s advertising passed these two hurdles. Yet the reality in most organisations is that these metrics are sometimes not even measured, no-one’s job depends on them, and no-one is responsible for fixing the problem. Therefore, no serious research and development is allocated to the issue – think how different this would be if the issue were wastage in the factory or product failures.

It’s true that advertising can work without us paying it much attention. We are able to notice things at a very low, even subconscious, level; for example, while in conversation at a crowded party we can still hear our name being called in the hubbub of background conversations. But just because part of our brain is monitoring our environment at a very low level, it doesn’t mean that it lets this information impinge much on our long-term memories. It’s better if advertising can generate more conscious attention and processing.

As people screen out so much advertising, the challenge is to get past the brain’s screening mechanisms and to generate that little emotional reaction in the direction of acceptance: ‘I will pay attention to this’. Therefore, the primary task of advertising agencies is to generate outstanding creative ideas that viewers will notice and will be willing to process over and over. This processing must be brand-centric; it must refresh the memory structures that relate to the brand. This is a difficult task, which is why most advertising fails. It’s also why some of the new findings from neuroscience and psychology are so important – we need to understand how attention and memories work.

We now know that very little thinking, if any, can be described as purely rational. Emotion is a primary source of human motivation, and exerts substantial influence on attention, memory and behaviour; it is no wonder emotion is heavily used in advertising. For example, emotion can be seen in advertising when the audience sheds a tear watching an ad for cancer research, or laughs with the characters in a beer ad, or shows shock, fear and relief watching an insurance ad.
