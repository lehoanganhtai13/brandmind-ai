# Icon brands

It’s not just the buying of everyday, run-of-the-mill brands that causes the patterns reported above. These laws also apply to ‘icon brands’, which are brands that are supposed to represent the height of marketing excellence and consumer bonding. For example, Nike is considered (by the CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi, Kevin Roberts (2004, pp. 78-9)) to be a Lovemark brand, which is a brand that inspires ‘loyalty beyond reason’. Yet an analysis by Dr John Dawes (2009) clearly shows that Nike conforms to the double jeopardy law and the duplication of purchase law: Nike’s buyers are not 100% loyal; they give it no more loyalty than it should receive given its market share (i.e. Nike’s receives less loyalty than Adidas in some markets). Nike sells to the same sort of people as other sports brands, to similar demographics, social classes and psycho-geo-demo-graphics (see Dawes 2009). These patterns in real buying behaviour raise serious questions about the degree to which buyers perceive rival brands to be different.

# Perceived differentiation

So how do buyers choose between branded options? Do buyers need to perceive that the brand they are purchasing is different? Do they need another reason to buy the brand (other than offering the benefits of the category, e.g. it tastes like ice-cream or it works like a credit card)? Systematic study across product and service categories, countries, survey methods and questions types reveals two robust patterns:

1. Buyers of a brand perceive very weak differentiation – yet this does not stop them loyally buying that brand.
2. A brand’s level of perceived differentiation is very similar to their rivals.

For example, Table 8.2 reports the proportions of brands’ regular buyers who agree that the brand they buy is different or unique.

**Table 8.2:** Brand user perceptions of differentiation in the soft drink (UK) and banking (Australia) categories

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand perception for soft drinks and banks, categorized by "Different (%)", "Unique (%)", and "Either (%)". For soft drinks, brands like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Pepsi-Cola, Fanta, Pepsi Max, Schweppes, and Canada Dry are evaluated. Pepsi Max and Coca-Cola show the highest "Either (%)" at 19%, indicating a combined perception of being different or unique. Banks, including ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac, and St George, are similarly assessed. St George stands out with the highest "Either (%)" at 32%, suggesting a strong perception of being either different or unique compared to competitors. The averages reveal that, across the board, banks (18% "Either (%)") are perceived as more distinct or unique than soft drinks (16% "Either (%)"). **Source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.
