Now let’s look at pack sizes (see Table 5.10). The large can/bottle has double the market share of the small can/bottle. This is the case in every demographic group, except among older people where small bottles are slightly less popular.

**Table 5.10:** Demographic profile of small versus large sized soft drink bottles

This data presents a comparative analysis of market share for small and large bottles across various demographic groups. The overall market shows a higher share for large bottles (43%) compared to small bottles (19%). This trend generally holds true for most segments, with notable exceptions. Females exhibit a stronger preference for large bottles (47%) than males (38%), while males show a higher market share for small bottles (25%) compared to females (14%). Households with children or multiple persons generally favor large bottles, though the difference is marginal. A significant divergence appears in age demographics: younger individuals (<34 years old) strongly prefer small bottles (37%) over large ones (23%), whereas older individuals (55-74 years old) overwhelmingly favor large bottles (52%) over small ones (12%). Socioeconomic groups AB and E show similar, moderate preferences for large bottles.

Now let’s compare cola with lemonade (see Table 5.11). We can see that lemonade brands do better with older buyers. But since 54-74-year-olds make up a small part of the overall market for soft drinks this skew does practically nothing to make lemonade’s customer base different from cola’s customer base.
