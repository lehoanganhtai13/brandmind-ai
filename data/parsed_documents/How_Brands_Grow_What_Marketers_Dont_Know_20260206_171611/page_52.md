This data presents a comparative analysis of Coke and Pepsi sales in 2012, visualized as a stacked bar chart. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 20, representing units or categories, while the y-axis displays values from 0 to 80 in increments of 10. The chart structure indicates that Coke occupies the majority of the sales volume, represented by a red bar extending across almost the entire width of the chart. Pepsi's sales are depicted by a blue bar, positioned at the beginning of the x-axis and occupying a significantly smaller portion compared to Coke. This visual representation highlights Coke's dominant market share over Pepsi within the observed period.

So brands have many light buyers who buy the brand very occasionally. They buy the brand infrequently because they don’t buy from the category very often, and they buy a number of different brands. For example, it’s very common for a high-volume, packaged goods category to be bought on average less than 10 times a year by buyers.[21] Brands in such categories are only bought by their consumers three or four times a year on average. For such a brand their most typical buyers buy them barely more than once a year.

Marketers easily forget how rarely their buyers buy their brand. They are often surprised how low their average purchase frequency metric is (and they mistakenly conclude that this means there is plenty of scope to easily increase this metric). Few appreciate that this average is still much heavier than their typical buyer – and that the calculation of the average doesn’t include all those who happened to not purchase the brand at all during the period. The great mass of typical buyers only very occasionally buy a brand.

This shows up in services markets too, where a large proportion of customers buy most of their purchases from another brand. For example, in personal banking, almost half a bank’s customers will list another bank as their main financial institution.

At the other end of the buying spectrum there are a few buyers who buy a category often – and a few of these buy a category very often. These buyers are important because they deliver a lot of sales volume in spite of their small numbers.
