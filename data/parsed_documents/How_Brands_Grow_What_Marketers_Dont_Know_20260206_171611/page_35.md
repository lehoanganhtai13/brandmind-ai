credit cards), and this success gives them slightly more customers than expected – customers who hold just one product with them. So their deficient cross-selling metric is actually due to their unusual success in one part of the market. In other words, we see no evidence of excellence in cross-selling, though we do see some brands excelling at selling a particular product to *additional* customers.

In both categories there is very little difference between brands in cross-sell metrics. Every insurance brand has a customer base that, on average, buys one and a half services from them; each banking brand’s customers buy two services.

There are dubious case studies of firms that have achieved cross-selling success. One of the problems is that the metric ‘numbers of products’ is open to manipulation. For example, you must have a separate EFTPOS card even though the credit card we gave you can already access your savings account, oh and we’ve added a small overdraft to your savings account – voila the count of ‘products per customer’ goes up. When managers are set targets to increase ‘number of products’ per customer there is a strong incentive to be inventive and manipulate the loyalty metric. Wells Fargo is the market leader in retail banking in the US, it also claims to be the leader in cross-selling. It says it has reached six products per household (out of a potential of 16). Of course, double jeopardy says Wells Fargo has to have the highest loyalty metrics because of its market share. We also know that the difference between brands is unlikely to be great, and this appears to be the case. The Wall Street Journal (Smith 2011) reports that financial analysts are doubtful about Wells Fargo’s claims: “It’s always been a bone of contention, one of those things that Wall Street tended to view with a jaundiced eye,” says bank analyst Nancy Bush of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey. “If I have a checking account and get a debit card, that’s two products which another bank might only count as one”, she added. Unsurprisingly, other banks have disputed Well Fargo’s claim of leadership saying that their own cross-sell metrics are just as good.

None of this says that cross-selling is impossible, but it does imply that it’s nowhere near as easy as textbooks make out, and certainly not a route to huge sales gains. The lack of difference among the brands shown in Tables 2.6 and 2.7 suggests that dramatically changing cross-selling metrics is difficult and expensive (some brands have tried, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at their results).
