This doesn’t mean that our attitudes and beliefs are random, in the sense of being without direction, mindless. Rather it means that our individual brand memories, like our brand buying, are probabilistic. We each have a steady, ongoing propensity to think something, and for most of our beliefs that propensity is not 100%. Not surprisingly, whether or not we recall a belief is highly dependent on the situation, and is very much affected by the cues that are used to elicit the belief, and can change depending on what other things were going through our head at the time. [^51]

Our brand buying behaviour is like this: I might choose Avis 60% of the time, but that doesn’t mean that sometimes I won’t choose Hertz (indeed it suggests that I definitely will sometimes choose Hertz) even two or three times in a row. This behaviour appears to be random, even though each time I buy Avis or Hertz there are particular reasons for this. But those reasons are so variable that anyone watching my choices from a distance might think I was merely tossing a coin to make my choice (a coin that just happened to be weighted 60% in favour of Avis).

So perhaps our attitudes merely reflect our buying. Our behaviour has a strong effect on our attitudes. But also, the fickle nature of our intentions (or their recall) is one of the many causes of our probabilistic buying patterns. Presumably attitudes play a role, albeit a small one, in the weighting of that mental coin.

The key discovery is that most of what we think about brands is not absolute. It is natural to tick the survey box that says we are completely satisfied with the brand and one hour later tick the ‘only somewhat satisfied’ box. Indeed, most of what we think about brands is so trivial, so barely thought through, that we will happily change our mind in a second. [^52] Actually, it’s misleading for me to talk about changing of minds. It’s more apt to say that we haven’t completely made up our minds yet. Or rather that we have made up our minds to sometimes think/like/buy the brand.

Therefore, attitudinal commitment to brands (or to buying them) is much weaker than marketing mythology makes out. But it can exist; for example, the Apple computer on which this book is being typed is rather dear to me personally.
