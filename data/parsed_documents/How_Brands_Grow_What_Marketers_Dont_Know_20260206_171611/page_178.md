A simple explanation about how memory works is that memory consists of ‘nodes’ that hold pieces of information. If two pieces of information are associated (e.g. Vodafone and red), links exist between these nodes. Buyers have a network of information (also referred to as brand associations) linked to a brand name. For example, McDonald’s is associated with hamburgers, yellow arches and fast food. These links are developed and refreshed through experiences such as buying and using the brand, being exposed to marketing activities (such as advertising) and hearing about other people’s experiences.  

There are other aspects of memory, such as sensory memory for smell and taste, and the retrieval of emotions such as joy and pain, but they are more often recalled after a brand is thought of. For example, you think of McDonald’s and you have fond memories of your child’s last birthday (or not!); whereas for mental availability we are primarily interested in what makes McDonald’s thought of and/or noticed.  

The more extensive and fresher the network of memory associations about a brand, the greater the brand’s chance of being noticed or thought of in the variety of buying situations experienced by customers. Such memory associations also increase the chance of a brand being selected when multiple options are present.  

Therefore, building mental availability is about developing different memory links (that relate to a brand) to increase the scope of the brand-related network in people’s memories – the brand’s share of mind.  

# More than awareness  

Traditional awareness concepts of recognition and recall are typically driven by their measures<sup>92</sup>, which are invariably single cue measures (i.e. almost always the product category for recall, ‘What brands of power tools are you aware of?’) or the brand name for recognition (‘Have you heard of the brand “Black & Decker”?’). Variations on this theme, like top-of-mind awareness or speed of recall, don’t depart from this practice of using only a single cue. Not surprisingly, these measures crudely capture individuals’ memory structures and poorly predict the frequency that a brand will be noticed or recalled in buying situations.
