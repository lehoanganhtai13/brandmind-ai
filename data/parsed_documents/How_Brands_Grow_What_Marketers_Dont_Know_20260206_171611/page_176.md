# How brands really compete

Decades of research into the patterns in buying behaviour and marketing metrics has led to the surprising conclusion that brands compete for custom primarily in terms of mental and physical availability.

Brands that are easier to buy, for more people in more occasions, get bought more often. Brands that have greater market share are better known (and more noticed) by more people and are more widely available. In other words, brands with larger market share have greater physical and mental availability, and also have larger marketing budgets to support these assets.

Surprisingly, other brand differences have little impact. As discussed in Chapter 8, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and KFC are differentiated in many ways, not least in that they sell different food (burgers, pizza and fried chicken respectively), yet they compete as fast food brands (with McDonald’s maintaining its advantage of greater mental and physical availability). Each fast food brand sells to the same sorts of buyers (who hold similar attitudes about the brand(s) they use); fast food brands share buyers with each other as if their products are direct substitutes. Indeed, fast food brands spend considerable time reminding buyers of their similarities (e.g. McDonald’s stresses that it offers chicken (burgers) and KFC stresses that it offers (chicken) burgers).

Competition in terms of mental and physical availability fits the empirical facts observed in all product categories (see end of book for a list of marketing laws):

* Brands within a product category sell to nearly identical consumer bases; each brand’s consumer base varies from the others chiefly in terms of size (i.e. the number of buyers), not in demographics, psychographics, personality characteristics, values or attitudes (see Chapter 5),
* Buyers of a brand seldom view their brand as being different from its competitors – whether for symbolic, emotional or more prosaic reasons. Buyers very rarely view different brands as being unacceptable. Buyers of different brands express similar attitudes about their brand and similar reasons for buying it. When buyers adopt a new brand their attitudes change in favour of that brand. Buyers simply know and like the brands they buy, and they are vastly more likely to notice, consider and buy these brands over others. Regardless of a lack of differentiation at a brand level or added values, brands have real market-based assets and loyal buyers.
