very occasional) buyers (see Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). We saw that most Coca-Cola buyers only buy themselves a Coke once or twice a year. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a tiny portion of consumers who buy Coke every morning, noon and night. Consider what happens to the buying behaviour of a person who drinks Coke several times a day after seeing a Coca-Cola ad – nothing changes. So who is Coke’s advertising aimed at? It’s aimed at the millions of people who occasionally buy Coca-Cola, who scarcely ever think of Coke and who seldom buy it. These consumers could easily forget about it and not make their semiannual purchases. This is why established brands need to advertise: to hold onto their buyers (in the face of substantial competitor advertising) and to give themselves a chance to grow.

Coke’s advertising tries to grab a tiny window of our attention and remind us that Coke is fun, that we’ve had it before and we like it – Coke’s advertisements are mostly reminding us of things we already know. By doing this, Coke is trying to increase our (very low) probability of buying it tomorrow. If it works, it changes our probability of buying tomorrow from almost nothing (say 1 chance in 400) to slightly more than almost nothing (say 2 chances in 400). This is a change in probability that is so slight we’d hardly notice, which is why people say that advertising doesn’t affect them, because it’s too subtle for them to notice. But if every person who is exposed to a single Coca-Cola ad increases his or her buying propensity from 1 chance in 400 to 2 chances in 400, Coke’s sales among this group double! <sup>70</sup> Therefore, even advertising that says nothing persuasive and gives no new reasons to buy can have a dramatic impact on sales – without causing people to rethink their opinion of a brand, and largely without them even noticing.

This explains why even established brands have to spend considerable sums on advertising – the bigger the brand the more they have to spend, even if they are old and well known. It also explains why consumers often say they don’t believe they are affected by advertising. In addition, it accounts for why advertising’s sales effects show up in sales figures in a very different way than price promotions do. Put simply, the entire sales effect of a price promotion shows up in a week’s sales figures, while the sales effect of advertising is spread very thinly into the future; this makes changes in advertising weight very difficult to see and extraordinarily hard to measure/model reliably.
