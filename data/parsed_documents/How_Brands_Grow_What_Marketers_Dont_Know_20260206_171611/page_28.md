**Table 2.3:** Double Jeopardy Law – shampoo UK

This data presents a comparative analysis of shampoo brands in the UK market as of 2010, illustrating the "Double Jeopardy Law" principle. The table details market share, annual market penetration, and average purchase frequency for several brands, including Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Dove, L’Oreal Elvive, Sunsilk, and Vosene. Head & Shoulders leads with the highest market share (11%) and penetration (23%), while also exhibiting a relatively high purchase frequency (1.9). Conversely, brands with lower market shares, such as L’Oreal Elvive, Sunsilk, and Vosene, generally show lower penetration rates and purchase frequencies. The data suggests a correlation where leading brands command larger market shares and higher customer engagement, while smaller brands struggle to achieve comparable penetration and repeat purchase rates, with an overall average purchase frequency of 1.7 across the analyzed brands.

In 2010, Head & Shoulders was bought by more than four times as many buyers as bought Vosene. This much larger customer base largely explains why Head & Shoulders had five times the sales of Vosene. Another small contributing factor is that buyers of Head & Shoulders were more loyal, buying it 0.3 times more often per annum.

Data from Nielsen shows that the US shampoo category exhibits the same pattern. Different brands, different market shares, different consumers, different time period, different consumer panel and analysts – but the same familiar double jeopardy pattern. Later we’ll discuss why this occurs and what the loyalty implications are, but for now let’s continue to focus on the implications of this scientific law for brand growth.

**Table 2.4:** Double Jeopardy Law – shampoo US

This data presents a comparative analysis of shampoo brands in the US market in 2005, illustrating the "Double Jeopardy Law" concept. It details market share, annual market penetration, and average purchase frequency for several brands, including Suave Naturals, Pantene Pro-V, Alberto V05, Garnier Fructis, Dove, and Finesse. The data shows a general trend where brands with higher market share, such as Suave Naturals (12%) and Pantene Pro-V (10%), also exhibit higher annual market penetration (19% and 16%, respectively) and purchase frequencies (2 and 1.9). Conversely, brands with lower market share, like Finesse (1%), have correspondingly lower penetration (2%) and purchase frequency (1.4). The overall average purchase frequency across these brands is 1.7. This structure highlights a relationship where leading brands tend to be purchased more frequently, supporting the Double Jeopardy Law's assertion that larger brands are more likely to be bought more often.

Snapshots of market share shifts over time (in the US, Canada and UK) also show double jeopardy: brands grow primarily by increasing their market penetration (Anschuetz 2002; Baldinger, Blair & Echambadi, 2002; Stern & Ehrenberg 2003). Shorter-term dynamic analysis by Andrew Ehrenberg and Colin McDonald (2003) showed that in 157 cases of small annual market share change the double jeopardy law was clear: both rising and declining brands displayed more change in their penetration than in their purchase frequency.
