A loyalty program’s success depends on recruiting many consumers from the lower left-hand quadrant, which is unlikely. Ideally, from a cost perspective, a program needs to recruit as few consumers as possible who are already loyal to the brand (this, however, is probably impossible). What happens in the real world? As you have probably suspected, loyalty programs are good at recruiting existing buyers of a brand (both heavy and light category buyers) but lousy at recruiting heavy category buyers who are not current buyers of a brand.

Table 11.3 shows the category buying rate of members and non-members of a loyalty program<sup>80</sup>. The table clearly shows that loyalty programs fail to attract a disproportionate number of heavier buyers.

**Table 11.3:** Buying rates of members and non-members of a loyalty program

This data presents a comparative analysis of average purchase frequency across various retail categories for consumers who joined a program versus those who did not. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences in purchasing behavior based on program participation. For supermarkets, consumers who joined the program had an average purchase frequency of 27, while non-participants averaged 28. Retail fuel showed a similar pattern with frequencies of 13 and 14, respectively. Department stores and credit cards exhibited a slightly higher frequency among non-participants (10 vs. 9). Telecommunications displayed identical average purchase frequencies of 26 for both groups. A second entry for credit cards showed 9 for both participants and non-participants. Overall, the average purchase frequency across all listed categories was 15 for both consumers who joined the program and those who did not, indicating no significant difference at the aggregate level.

In spite of the discussion above, this discovery is a little surprising because heavier category buyers (both regular buyers of a brand and non-buyers) have much more to gain from a loyalty program. It makes sense to expect that loyalty program members would be heavier buyers (of a category).

What this shows is that mental and physical availability is the dominant driver of recruitment to loyalty programs – ahead of the attractiveness of the rewards. Existing buyers of a brand join; that is, both heavy and light buyers of the category. This suggests that the best way to promote a loyalty program, and recruit members, is to avoid using a brand’s own stores, website or mailing list. Ideally, a brand would recruit members in its competitors’ stores! Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to overcome the inherent characteristics of a loyalty program – that it will skew towards existing buyers of the brand. This is why loyalty programs can’t have much effect. They essentially reward existing buyers for what they already do.

Loyalty programs are not good at affecting loyalty. They are more suited to being used to build a database of consumers, creating a new channel to talk to consumers and a way of monitoring their buying in-store.
