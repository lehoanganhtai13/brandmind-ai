* supermarket packaged goods  
* national and retailer brands  
* brand buying and store choice.

The laws apply across countries and have held for decades. This is why they can provide useful predictions.  
I’ve tried to demonstrate the breadth of generalisation by deliberately using diverse examples; for example, retention levels for both cars in France and banks in Australia. I am grateful to Nielsen and Kantar for providing data spanning many countries. Please don’t infer that just because the example refers to, say, UK store brands, that the law doesn’t apply to your category. If you are in doubt, please refer to the cited references, as these will provide further examples that illustrate the breadth of the law.

# Acknowledgements

The empirical laws in this book might not have been discovered without the years of research that has been funded by corporations around the world. In particular I would like to thank the following corporations for their many years of continuing support of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute:

This data presents a three-column, comparative listing of various entities, primarily organizations and companies. The columns are not explicitly labeled, but the content suggests a categorization, possibly by industry, function, or geographical origin, though no explicit grouping is defined. The entities listed include a mix of well-known corporations such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and General Motors, alongside research organizations like the Advertising Research Foundation and the Australian Research Council, and financial institutions like ANZ Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The structure is a simple, flat list within each column, with no hierarchical relationships or process flows indicated. The overall presentation is a straightforward enumeration of distinct entities across three parallel, unassociated lists. Roy Morgan Research          Reckitt Benckiser            SABMiller
