If this weren’t the case, then we would routinely see brands that had different buying distributions, and unusually high loyalty metrics for their market share levels. But we don’t.

Conversely, marketing that targets light buyers of the brand, and/or non-buyers, has far greater chance of success. This is because such marketing has great reach. Most of a brand’s buyers are light buyers, and because it’s nearly impossible to simply target light buyers, heavy buyers tend to get hit too. And heavy buyers are far more likely to notice advertising, visit stores and notice publicity.

A classic example of brand growth is due to winning distribution in a new geographical area. This reaches buyers who, because it was inconvenient for them, were previously light buyers (or even real non-buyers) of the brand. These previously light/non-buyers start buying the brand and its penetration metric jumps up. The new store also improves the availability of the brand for existing heavier buyers, when they happen to be in the neighbourhood. So over time they also buy a little more often. This helps nudge up average purchase frequency (and other loyalty metrics). This large rise in penetration and small gain in loyalty fits the double jeopardy pattern we saw in brand performance metrics in Chapter 2.

# Conclusion

Now you know how brands grow and how marketing, when it is successful, affects buying rates. The implications counter much fashionable marketing thought, and yet are clear and simple:

1. Acquisition is vital for growth and maintenance.
2. Reaching all buyers is vital, especially light, occasional buyers of the brand.

This is a recipe for clever mass marketing, which is not surprising because it was clever mass marketing (not CRM, relationship marketing or loyalty programs) that built the majority of today’s leading brands. But it need not be a recipe for unsophisticated mass marketing. Reaching all potential buyers of a brand, at the right time and at low cost, is tricky and there is much to learn.
