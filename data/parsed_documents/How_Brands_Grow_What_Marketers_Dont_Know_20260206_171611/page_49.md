So for Coca-Cola to have an average buying rate of just 12, each of these super heavy buyers must be balanced by many hundreds of Coke buyers who buy only a few times a year.

The Kantar Impulse Panel data shows that a typical Coca-Cola buyer purchases (for him- or herself) just one or two cans or bottles a year. That’s half of all Coke buyers. Only a tiny fraction of Coke buyers purchase around the average amount of 12 purchases. Therefore, the average buyer is certainly not typical.

Around 30% of cola buyers don’t even buy themselves a single Coca-Cola each year. Note that these are people who do buy cola (not just soft drink) – so most of these people do indeed buy Coca-Cola, just very occasionally and not every year!

Therefore, from Coca-Cola’s perspective, a heavy buyer is anyone who buys three or more cans or bottles of Coke a year. Many of us who thought we hardly every bought Coke now turn out to be quite normal Coke buyers. Very light buyers dominate, even for Coca-Cola – which is a very large brand indeed.
