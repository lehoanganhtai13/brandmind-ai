Price cutting has a large, direct effect, but a very small reach. Advertising has great reach but a small direct effect at the level of the individual consumer. Advertising arguably also has a long lasting effect, because it works on underlying propensities, whereas price promotion does not affect ongoing propensity and does not have favourable long-term effects.

It is certainly true that in-store price promotions are highly targeted: they only reach the buyers who are in the market for that category in that week. It would therefore seem they should be very efficient. However, this targeting through price promotions is very expensive – 10% or 20% off the price of every item sold! Price cutting gives a lot away to people who would buy the brand anyway.

For manufacturers who sell through distribution channels, price promotions can occur with several levels of retailer support, and retailer support has implications for reach. The lowest level of support is an in-store price cut with only the ubiquitous ‘special’ ticket on shelf. An in-store price cut has the lowest level of reach, because only consumers who happen to be in the store and look at brands in the category at the time will notice it. The number of consumers who would do so in any given week comprise a very small proportion of the market. For example, in grocery markets, in a typical promotion period of two weeks, approximately 60% of households buy bread, 20% buy soup and 10% purchase a category such as shampoo – but these figures are the total penetration across all retailers. A price promotion in any one retailer will only reach a fraction of these buyers: given a retailer market share of say 10%, such a price promotion in that retailer will only reach 10% x 60% = 6% of bread buyers, 10% x 20% = 2% of soup buyers and 10% x 10% = 1% of shampoo buyers. So this sort of price promotion has very low reach.

The next level of in-store support involves an ‘end-of-aisle’ display. Nearly everyone in the store at the time could notice this display, but there is an upper limit on its reach, being the proportion of the population shopping in that retailer in that week – which is often a small proportion.

The third level of distributor support involves the brand being advertised in catalogues or through the retailer’s mass media advertising. This takes the price promotion, and the brand, to a much broader audience. Arguably, the reach of this level of support is as large as the reach of mainstream advertising.
