This data visually represents a market share distribution, likely illustrating how different market segments contribute to overall market share. The structure appears to be a comparative or correlational display, mapping a range of market share percentages from 0 to 100 against a scale that also ranges from 0 to 10. The presence of a '+' symbol suggests an additive or cumulative relationship between the two scales, implying that as the value on the 0-10 scale increases, the weighted distribution of market share also increases, reaching a maximum of 100%. The table's layout indicates a direct relationship where higher values on the initial scale correspond to higher weighted distributions of market share.

So brands require broad availability if they are to have a chance of high market share, but again it is not guaranteed. Every major consumer marketing corporation in the world has rolled out a new brand (or SKU) with extensive distribution only to see it languish on shelf. Indeed some of these firms will roll out hundreds, even thousands of such ‘innovations’ this year that will sell for only a while on the back of them paying for prominent positions in store, with accompanying promotions and discounts. The lesson is clear, physical and mental availability need to go hand in hand, advertising falls flat when the brand isn’t physically available, and brands sit on shelves when consumers don’t notice them.

Extending physical availability can be increasingly expensive, for example gaining distribution in the major supermarkets may give a grocery brand substantial availability while gaining beyond this will involve pushing into convenience stores which is logistically far more complex. There are offsetting advantages however, as a brand expands its distribution it tends to enter progressively less competitive retail environments (e.g. a vending machine that only stocks your brands) (Farris et al 1989).

I’m surprised how often marketers of consumer goods and services will say, “Oh well, we have practically 100% availability”. They point to their brand’s presence in all the leading supermarket chains, or their national branch network or their web site that can take orders 24 hours a day. None of this comes close to 100% availability. Perhaps the problem is the word “availability”; I don’t mean “available if a consumer is motivated to seek out the product”, I mean readily available.
