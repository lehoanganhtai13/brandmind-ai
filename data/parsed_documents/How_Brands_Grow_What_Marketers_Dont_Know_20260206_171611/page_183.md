Like the often reported aim of Coca-Cola to be no more than an arm’s length away. Against a standard like this, it’s easy to see that every marketer has potential to improve the physical availability of their brand.

# How brands compete for sales

In the long run, brands essentially compete in terms of mental and physical availability. Even product innovation largely works (when it works) by enhancing mental availability and gaining further physical distribution. Building mental availability requires distinctiveness and clear branding, while brands seldom compete on meaningful differentiation. This means that marketing attention should be focused on building these assets so that a brand is easier to buy, for more people and in more buying situations. No marketing activity, including innovation, should be seen as a goal in itself, its goal is to hold on to or improve mental and physical availability.

# Profits that last

One of the things that makes established brands so valuable is that mental and physical availability take a long time to build and a long time to fade. This stability is worth money. Brands, whether large or small, are able to survive, often for very long periods, because they are able to maintain their market-based assets of mental and physical availability. Growth depends on enhancing these assets. Even temporary advantages (such as advances in products or services) can enhance these potentially sustainable assets. Advantages that do not enhance these assets have no long-term value. For example, price promotions, because of their lack of reach, do little or nothing to enhance mental and physical ability, even though such promotions cause increases in sales. When the price promotion ends, everything returns to normal largely because price promotions reach so few buyers, and are particularly poor at reaching new buyers. 94

# Mental and physical availability – a brand’s market-based assets

Over the past twenty years there has been growing appreciation for the intangible assets that underpin the financial value of corporations (Sharp 1995; Srivastava et al 1998).
