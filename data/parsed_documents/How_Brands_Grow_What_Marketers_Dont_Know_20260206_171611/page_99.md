The article’s statistical analysis shows every question in the survey is highly correlated with every other question which apparently somehow gives “richness and diagnostic insight”. To disguise their lack of findings the authors use many vacuous phrases that are meant to impress like:  
* “leads to a much more comprehensive and integrated understanding of how consumers actually experience brand love than the prior academic study of its individual components”,  
* and “we believe that our higher order prototype model adds value”  

The trivial nature of this research is well illustrated by the vague recommendations for marketing managers to:  
* “facilitate passion-driven behaviors…e.g. Scion cars encourage owners to choose…wheels, sports mufflers and so on”  
* “build brands that facilitate self-brand integration”  
* “create positive emotional connections”.  

All this in a journal that prides itself on producing findings that are valuable to practitioners!  
Almost buried on the very last page is a single line within a paragraph: “However, the brands consumers really love are likely to be a small minority of the total brands they purchase”. To put this another way, any brand manager will find that only a tiny number of their buyers have anything that approaches love for the brand.  

Another such academic article (titled “Emotional Branding Pays Off”) that desperately tried to hype up the importance of brand love actually found that a mere 4% of the average Australian beer brand’s male buyers ticked the survey box “I would say that I feel deep affection for this brand, like ‘love’, and would be really upset if I couldn’t have it”. If an Australian male can’t get emotional about beer brands then what brands can anyone get emotional about? And these few brand lovers reported only buying the brand half the time (i.e. they mostly bought other brands they did not love).  

Sadly I expect a raft of misguided PhD theses on brand love over the next decade, as academia falls in and then out of love with its latest fad.  

While it may be new to academia, the idea that consumers have ‘relationships’ with brands is an old idea, which is routinely repackaged by marketing consultants. Kevin Roberts’ Lovemarks is a classic, and quite humorous, example.
