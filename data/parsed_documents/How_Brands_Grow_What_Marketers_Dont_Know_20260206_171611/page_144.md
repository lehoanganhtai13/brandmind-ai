As discussed, there are two main ways that advertising works: persuasion (changing opinions) and mental availability (refreshing and building memories). There are other mechanisms, but these are more subtle and are often secondary to salience and/or persuasion. These other mechanisms include bond, status signals and priming, which are discussed below.

# The bond mechanism

Spending money on advertising signals that a company is financially secure and/or their products are good, which is particularly important for services. Corporate reputation advertising is a prime example. The practice of spending large amounts of money on employing top celebrities to appear in ads, or sponsoring large events like the Olympics, is explained by this mechanism. Some consumers infer, perhaps subconsciously, that an advertiser would not foolishly spend lots of money on advertising if it did not have confidence in its product and did not intend to be around for a long time. Also, consumers’ experience has taught them that heavily advertised products and services tend to be good quality.

Economists have supported this idea by arguing that the amount spent on advertising often seems more important than the message in determining the commercial outcome (i.e. Nelson 1974; Telser 1964). This does not mean that advertising has no economic function or that viewers are irrational; rather, viewers respond to signals beyond the explicit messages. The economist John Kay (1993) asserts that most people are inherently cynical about truth in advertising and that they automatically discount claims about quality made in advertisements that cannot be objectively assessed. In this circumstance, he argues (exaggerating somewhat), the only thing advertising can convey is the quality and quantity of the advertising itself.

# Status signals

When we use some brands we signal to others, and even to ourselves, what sort of person we are.
