To quote, “Lovemarks are brands that create an intimate emotional connection that you simply can’t do without. Ever.” (Roberts 2004).<sup>47</sup>  
A more down-to-earth view is that if buyers don’t care deeply about a brand then they could be easily lured away to buy another brand. Yet even this supposedly commonsense statement is actually an untested empirical assumption. It’s just as plausible to argue that a lack of caring is the cornerstone of ongoing loyalty.

# Connection to a brand

Consumers are busy people. They have hundreds of thousands of brands vying for their attention. Thanks to the competitive modern economy, and government regulation, most of these options are sound. Therefore, the choice of brand is trivial compared to the decision of whether or not to purchase from the category. And aside from cars, houses and a minority of other categories, even the decision to buy from the category is a minor one – “Shall I have a snack or wait until lunch?”

Brands are a necessary evil: they add a layer of complexity to the buying decision, but they also allow for routines (“Ah, there’s my brand” or, “Oh yes, I’ve heard of that one”); such habits make buying easier – automatic even. From cars to canned soup, routine results in passionless<sup>48</sup> brand loyalty. Also, we’re usually so unaware of our habits that we barely notice that we eat the same meals, shop from the same shops, etc. And, as we’ve seen, loyalty is rarely exclusive; it’s nothing like loyalty to a sports team or a country. Buyers typically have a number of brands that they routinely buy, so 100% exclusive loyalty is much rarer than marketers expect.

Marketing texts sometimes dismiss these buying patterns as simply a case of the messy real world deflecting customers from their true intentions. But this interpretation doesn’t fit the facts when attitudes, perceptions and intentions are measured. Consumers’ thoughts and plans also show this prosaic uncommitted loyalty.

# Brand knowledge, attitudes and intentions

Long ago marketing wisdom was that Avis buyers rented from Avis and Hertz buyers rented from Hertz. So if Hertz had 23% market share in a particular country, it was assumed that 23% of car renters used Hertz. As soon as marketing scientists starting looking at ongoing panel records of real-world repeat buying they realised the error of their assumption.
