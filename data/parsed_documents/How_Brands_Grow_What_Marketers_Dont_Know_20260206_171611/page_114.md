Therefore, all brands are seen in much the same way by those familiar with them. Even small brands get a similar endorsement from their few buyers.

**Table 8.1:** Association of brands with attributes

This table presents a comparative analysis of seven companies (FedEx, A, Nokia, B, C, Oracle, D) across seven attributes: Trusted, Efficient, Rapport, Relevant, Solution, Innovative, and Essential. Each company is assigned a score for each attribute, with a final 'Average' score calculated across all attributes. The data is structured to allow for direct comparison of company performance on individual attributes and their overall average standing. A final row provides the average score for each attribute across all companies, offering a benchmark for evaluation. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences and similarities in how these companies are perceived across the defined attributes.

Once these patterns are known, it is easy to spot the few exceptions; for example, Nokia and Oracle (two technology brands) are considered more ‘innovative’. This is not an unexpected or exciting story.

This is not to say that some brands aren’t perceived differently to their rival brands, but any sizable differences in perception usually reflect very obvious functional aspects; for example, American brands are perceived as American, French as French and expensive brands as expensive. Perceptual surveys are still useful – they are just far less deterministic and mysterious than they are typically portrayed. Their utility lies in marketers using them to ensure that all their advertising is truly branded (i.e. to look like you, you need to know how the market already sees you).

# Brand personality

It’s very difficult to find exotic image attributes (i.e. not related to obvious functional features) that substantially differentiate rival brands. Brand personality is a recent attempt. Long ago, marketing researchers began investigating the impact of a buyer’s personality on their brand choice. This was quickly shown to be inconsequential. The famous study into Ford versus Chevrolet buyers by Franklin B Evans was one of the first to challenge this notion: the study found no difference in the personality traits of the different brand buyers (Evans 1959).

However, personality researchers persisted. The goal became to identify the human personality a brand is reflecting. Interest in brand personality heightened with the publication of Jennifer Aaker’s (1997) ‘brand personality’ scale, which measures the human characteristics that consumers associate with brands, such as charm or ruggedness.
