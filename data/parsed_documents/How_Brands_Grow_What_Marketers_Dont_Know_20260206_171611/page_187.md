Similarly, we found that more than half the submissions from established brands were cases of advertising being started again after a very long hiatus.

For marketers of established brands, everything they do is moderated by the brand’s market-based assets. Their job is not so much to stimulate current sales but to maintain and build the brand’s market-based assets. Such marketers should be less concerned with producing sales blips with short-lived campaigns, and much more concerned with building mental and physical availability.

Thomas Bayne, CEO of Mountain View Learning, suggests marketers should adopt a balance sheet-style document to assess their marketing efforts. The balance sheet lists what is most likely to reinforce or build mental and physical availability and what is least likely. Table 12.4 is an example of such a document (to which you might like to add). Remember, any marketing activity that skews to part of the customer base (particularly to the heavier, more loyal customers) is unlikely to build mental or physical availability.

**Table 12.4** Marketing ‘balance sheet’ example

This table outlines strategies for reinforcing or building mental and physical availability of a brand, categorized by their likelihood of success. Strategies very likely to reinforce availability include broadening distribution, gaining new distribution channels, consistent use of distinctive brand assets, consistent advertising, broad-reaching media, gaining shelf space in new store areas, and offering a broad range of product varieties and pack formats. Strategies with low reach, unlikely to reinforce availability, encompass coupons and price promotions, packaging changes, loyalty programs, competitions, and bursting/pulsing advertising. Finally, strategies deemed unknown or risky include advertising with new information, temporary product variants, comparative advertising, and suspense advertising where the brand name is hidden. The structure is comparative, evaluating different marketing tactics based on their potential impact on brand availability.

# What about product and price?

In the main, the battle for custom is largely about mental and physical availability. Of course product and price matter - especially if they fall behind the competition.
