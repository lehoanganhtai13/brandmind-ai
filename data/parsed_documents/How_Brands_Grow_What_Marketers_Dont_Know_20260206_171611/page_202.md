While light buyers buy more often and some non-buyers become buyers. This ‘regression to the mean’ phenomenon reflects **no real change** in buyer behaviour, and happens for stable brands. See Chapter 4.

* **Natural monopoly law:** Brands with more market share have a greater proportion of light category buyers in their customer base. See Chapter 7.

* **Customer bases seldom vary:** Rival brands sell to very similar customer bases. See Chapter 5.

* **Attitudes reflect behavioural loyalty:** Consumers know and say more about brands they use, and think and say little about brands they do not use. Therefore, larger brands always score higher on surveys of brand attitudes, simply because they have more users (who are also slightly more loyal).

* **Usage drives attitude (or I love my Mum and you love yours):** Buyers of different brands express very similar attitudes and quite similar perceptions about their respective brands. For implication see Chapter 5.

* **Duplication of purchase law:** A brand’s customer base overlaps rival brands’ customer bases in line with their market share (i.e. in a time period a brand will share more of its customers with large brands and fewer with small brands). If 30% of a brand’s buyers also bought brand A in a period, then around 30% of every rival brand’s customers also bought brand A over that period. See Chapter 6.

* **Non-linear relationship between physical availability and market share:** 80% or more weighted physical distribution is necessary, but not sufficient, for a brand to have high market share.

* **NBD-Dirichlet:** A mathematical model of how buyers vary in their purchase propensities, i.e their loyalties (how often they buy the category and which brands they buy). It correctly describes and explains many of the above laws. ‘The Dirichlet’ as it is known was developed by Gerald Goodhardt, Andrew Ehrenberg and Chris Chatfield. It is one of marketing’s few true scientific theories (i.e. based on empirical laws). For more technical information on this mathematical model (and related software) see Goodhardt et al (1984), and contact the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute www.MarketingScience.info W-W
