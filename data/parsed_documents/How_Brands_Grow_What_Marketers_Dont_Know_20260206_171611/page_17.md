As Robert Louis Stevenson said, “Everybody lives by selling something”. Poor marketing wastes an incalculable amount of resources, and it prevents and slows the uptake of life-enhancing products and social initiatives.

Marketing practice, for all its advances, has never been strong on R&D into marketing practices; there is plenty of ineffectiveness and room for improvement. Response rates to advertising are perhaps an indicator of inefficiency. However you define a consumer response – from clicking on a web ad to driving to a store – response levels are extremely low, and in some places falling. It’s even more scary if you look at the impact of advertising on memory. For example, one of our yet-to-be-published studies[^4] on advertising productivity examined 143 ads on Australian television that were screened on consecutive weeknight evenings. That weekend respondents were telephoned and those who watched the programs during which the ads were played were asked if they recognised the particular television commercial (i.e. each ad was verbally described to only those people who had an opportunity to see it). The average recognition score for a television ad was barely 40% (i.e. 40% of potential viewers noticed the ad when it aired). Those respondents who recognised the ad were then asked what brand it was for, and on average the correct brand was linked to only approximately 40% of the ads. Consider that for an ad to work, at the very least, it needs to be noticed, processed and be linked to the correct brand. So only around 16% of these advertising exposures passed the two necessary hurdles; put another way, there was 84% wastage^5

Note that the effectiveness of the ads varied widely. Some were noticed by more viewers, and correctly branded too. But most were not. This suggests that there is much to gain from learning how to make better advertising.

*Though hard to see, the advertiser here is actually ASB Bank, they are trying to knock a competitor Kiwi Bank (who should be laughing…all the way to the bank)* There is much to learn about marketing.
