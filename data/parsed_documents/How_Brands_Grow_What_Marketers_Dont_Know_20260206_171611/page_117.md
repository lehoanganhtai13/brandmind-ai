In the real world differentiation undoubtedly exists. The idea that brands are identical commodities is fiction; for a start, they have different names that can be used by buyers to develop loyalties and show preference[^60]. Equally importantly, there is a tremendous amount of situational differentiation, for example:

* this brand is here now, while the others are not  
* I know where this bakery is  
* I have an account with them  
* this one has my size  
* this is the only one in red  
* I’m in the mood for chocolate  
* it was the one I noticed  
* it was the one that came to mind  

These situational differences affect all brands; this means that they all enjoy some differentiation. But is there also differentiation at the brand level? Do some buyers (across time and buying situations) see and value a difference?

The first thing that should make us question the importance of differentiation is that loyalty does not vary much between rival brands (see Chapter 2). Loyalty definitely exists, but it is a characteristic of consumer behaviour, rather than being driven by brand differentiation. This means that all brands should benefit from loyalty. But if there is substantial differentiation at the brand level, then why doesn’t loyalty differ much between brands? Why are niche brands, with small but highly loyal customer bases, not commonplace?

The second thing we should consider is that if brand-level differentiation is strong then a brand should appeal more to a particular type of person who particularly values the brand’s style of differentiated offer. Yet, as discussed in Chapter 5, brand-user profiles don’t differ much – competing brands in a category sell to very similar customer bases (Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2001a). Brands with vastly different prices (and quality) have different user profiles; expensive brands tend to be bought by wealthier people. But within their competitive set, the brands’ user bases are similar: Versace’s buyers are similar to Gucci’s, and Nike’s buyers are similar to those who buy Adidas’s.

Differentiation theory suggests there should be a great deal of market partitioning (where brands share more or fewer customers than they would be expected to according to their respective market shares).
