Also, children with more television sets in their home were more likely to select the branded item. But other moderator variables – having a television in the bedroom, having McDonald’s toys in the house, and hours of television viewing – had no detectable influence.

Decades of testing preferences and quality cues has taught us that when a single cue is introduced into a study respondents react strongly to it. This is probably because subjects feel they are supposed to react to the cue.

Because it is the only cue, it becomes artificially salient. *It is surprising that these sorts of artificial studies are still being done.* Similar weak preferential results might probably be gained by simply wrapping one of the items in coloured paper and the other in plain.

Therefore, we shouldn’t read too much into these sorts of studies, which very often have a political agenda behind them – they invariably find results in the direction the researchers expected. What is worth noting though is how mild the effects are, even in these artificial constructions. The main finding again seems to be that prior usage of the brand makes a person slightly more favourable towards it. This is one of the psychological factors underpinning brand loyalty.

# Brand loyalty – a natural part of buying behaviour

Brand loyalty is part of every market, even in so called commodity categories. Rather than thinking of loyalty as a market imperfection, it is more appropriately considered to be a sensible buyer strategy, one of many developed by human beings in order to balance risk and avoid wasting the precious commodity of time.

In 1964 Professor Tucker of Texas University conducted an interesting experiment into the development of brand loyalty. His experiment revealed that buyers naturally tend towards brand loyalty – loyalty is a buying strategy that most of us adopt much of the time. In Tucker’s experiment, each day, for 12 days, loaves of bread from the same commercial oven were offered on a tray for choice to 42 women. The loaves were wrapped identically, and each day one was labelled L, another M, P and H. The position of the brands on the tray was rotated. In spite of the loaves being identical, many of the respondents quickly adopted loyal behaviours, with each woman favouring a particular brand. Some also favoured positions on the tray (e.g. tending to choose the brand that was on the left of the tray). This landmark study concluded that it is clear that brand loyalty is based on what may seem to be trivial distinctions.
