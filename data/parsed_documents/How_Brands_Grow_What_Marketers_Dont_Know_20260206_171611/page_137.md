72 There might be a longer lasting effect if purchasing and using the discounted brand leads to enhanced mental availability, but the evidence is that longer term sales effects of price promotions are essentially zero (see Chapter 10). Advertising’s effect on purchase probability occurs through the effect on memories, and memories have some ability to last.73 Whereas price discounts affect purchase probability because we like a better deal, if one of the brands that we use and notice is on sale then the chance leaps that we choose it over the other brands in our repertoire – but our purchase probabilities return to normal immediately afterwards. So the price discount only works while it is there.

That’s great news for those seeking to measure the sales impact of price promotions (the full sales effect can be seen and measured in a week’s sales figures), but it’s sobering news for those seeking to measure the sales impact of advertising. It means you should never mix price promotion effects and advertising effects into a single econometric modelling attempt to quantify the relative sales effects of advertising and price changes.

However, the good news is that the sales response to advertising can be seen even when a market is stable and there is no aggregate level change in sales for the advertised brand. This requires what is known as ‘single-source data’: individual-level data that records continuously over time what each individual buys and what advertising they are exposed to. To explain the advantage of such data, consider how a direct marketer would assess the impact of a direct mail campaign to selected households in Chicago. Would they use national sales data? No. Would they use Chicago sales data? No. They would look at the buying patterns of the households they sent the letter to. No one expects sales to change in households that didn’t get the letter. Also, to correctly estimate the real sales impact, the marketer would compare sales among these households against a benchmark, such as the sales of similar households who were deliberately not sent the letter. Single-source data lets us employ the same logical approach to assessing the impact of television, print and other advertising exposures (Kennedy, McDonald & Sharp 2008; McDonald & Sharp 2005).

Forty years of single-source-based analysis has delivered solid empirical evidence that advertising drives sales among those who are exposed to it (and that some advertisements are vastly better than others). These findings have held across a range of brands, categories, countries and data sets (i.e. McDonald 1969; Jones 1995a & b; Roberts 1994; Roberts 1996; Roberts 1998; Newstead et al 2009; Taylor et al 2009; Wood 2009). This is good news for those who advertise.
