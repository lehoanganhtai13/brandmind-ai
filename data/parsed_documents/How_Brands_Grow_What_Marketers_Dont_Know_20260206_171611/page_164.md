Fortunately, the scientific laws introduced in this book mean that benchmarks are available for loyalty metrics; these remove the issue of selection effects and are used to see if brands that ran loyalty programs have unusual loyalty for their market share.  
Table 11.1 illustrates the results of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute’s study, which examined the cross-category loyalty program, FlyBuys (FlyBuys is a separate program in two countries: Australia and New Zealand). As the name suggests the loyalty program rewarded shoppers with points that could be redeemed for flights.  
Loyalty programs should make brands look niche, that is, their market share should be made up of unusually high loyalty for their market share and penetration. This is because loyalty programs reach a restricted part of the customer base and encourage these consumers to buy more frequently.<sup>77</sup> So a loyalty program might or might not grow a brand’s share much but it should make that share be an unusual combination of penetration and loyalty. Or put another way, it probably won’t drive penetration but it may drive loyalty (which is not the usual way brands grow) Table 11.1 shows each brand in the FlyBuys loyalty program and the penetration and loyalty metrics necessary to make up its market share. By comparing the predicted and observed market share composition, we can see there does appear to be a loyalty effect. However, the effect is so weak that it is inconsistent; some brands don’t show the pattern presumably because other marketing mix factors swamp the weak effect.

**Table 11.1:** The FlyBuys loyalty program

This data presents a comparative analysis of observed versus predicted customer base size and loyalty metrics across various retail sectors in Australia and New Zealand. The structure is hierarchical, categorizing by retail type (Department stores, Supermarkets, Retail petrol, Bank credit cards, Phone calls) and then by specific companies within those sectors. For each company, metrics are provided for Penetration (%), Average purchase frequency, Share of requirements (%), and Sole buyers (%), with both observed and predicted values. Notably, the Bank credit card sector in NZ shows particularly high observed loyalty metrics, with NAB and BNZ exhibiting substantial Share of requirements and Sole buyers, while the Phone calls sector (Telecom) also demonstrates very high penetration and loyalty. An overall average across all sectors is also presented, indicating a general trend of predicted values being slightly lower than observed for penetration and purchase frequency, but higher for sole buyers. **Source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute (see Sharp & Sharp 1997)**
