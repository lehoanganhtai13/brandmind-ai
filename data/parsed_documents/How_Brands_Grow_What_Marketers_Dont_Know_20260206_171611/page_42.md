Double jeopardy shows that it isn’t possible to radically alter defection rates without massively shifting market share.

Look at Table 3.1, which shows defection rates for car brands in the US. The data comes from a survey of 10,000 new car buyers in the US in 1989-91. The survey recorded what car brand they bought and what brand they owned previously (if any). Defection levels for cars are much higher than in most service industries, though still surprisingly low considering the dozens of other new car brands that each buyer could have bought rather than staying loyal. Each major car brand in the US suffers a defection rate of about 60-70%, or two-thirds of their customers. No brand has managed to obtain a defection rate vastly different from this average, and certainly not without having larger market share.

**Table 3.1:** Customer defection rates for car brands in the US, 1989-91

This data presents a comparative analysis of US automobile brands, detailing their market penetration and buyer defection rates. Brands like Pontiac and Dodge exhibit the highest market penetration at 9% and 8% respectively, with Pontiac showing a 58% buyer defection rate and Dodge also at 58%. Chevrolet and Ford, both at 8% and 6% market penetration, respectively, demonstrate higher buyer defection rates of 71%. Buick and Toyota, with 7% and 6% market penetration, show defection rates of 59% and 70%. Lower market penetration is seen with Oldsmobile and Mercury at 5% each, accompanied by high defection rates of 66% and 72%. Honda has the lowest market penetration at 4% but a high defection rate of 71%. The average buyer defection rate across these brands is 67%.

Table 3.2 is a similar table, showing defection rates for car brands in the UK. The data comes from a survey of 25,000 new car buyers in the UK and France in 1986-89. The survey recorded what car brand they bought and what brand they owned previously (if any). The UK and French markets are less fragmented than that in the US and the market shares of the reported brands are higher, and so, in line with the double jeopardy law, defection levels are lower.

Each brand suffers a defection rate of about 50% (i.e. a retention rate of also 50%). The double jeopardy pattern is again noticeable – the smaller brands have somewhat lower loyalty (higher defection rates). Ford, being the largest brand, has the lowest defection rate. But its defection level still isn’t that much lower than its rivals.

**Table 3.2:** Defection rates for car brands in the UK and France, 1986-89

This data presents a comparative analysis of UK automobile brands, detailing their market penetration and buyer defection rates. Ford leads in penetration at 27%, significantly higher than other brands, while Rover, GM, Nissan, VW/Audi, and Peugeot each hold substantial shares ranging from 16% down to 5%. Brands like Renault, Fiat, Citroen, Toyota, and Honda represent smaller market segments, with penetration rates from 4% down to 1%. Buyer defection rates, however, show a different pattern, with most brands experiencing over 40% defection. Peugeot exhibits the highest defection rate at 57%, followed closely by Honda (53%), Renault (52%), and Fiat and Toyota (both 50%). Rover, GM, and Nissan also show high defection rates above 40%. Ford, despite its high penetration, has a defection rate of 31%, which is lower than the average defection rate of 49% observed across all brands. The structure is comparative, highlighting variations in market performance and customer loyalty among different automobile manufacturers in the UK. Remember that Reichheld and Sasser assumed a cost-free halving of the defection level.
