## Why Loyalty Programs Don’t Work  
Byron Sharp  

----

Loyalty programs are structured marketing efforts that reward, and therefore encourage, loyal buying behaviour. The most typical programs provide consumers with points each time they make purchases. Gradually, after many purchases, these points add up and reach a level where they may be redeemed for rewards. This points system is an incentive for consumers to purchase a particular brand more frequently (i.e. increase their loyalty) in order to gain more rewards faster. Such loyalty programs might also discourage defection from the brand as, once customers have accumulated points, and if they enjoy and value the loyalty program, they should be less likely to defect to another brand. At least that’s how the logic goes.

Huge sums of money have been invested in loyalty programs over the past decade, be everyone from airlines to coffee shops. Some marketers implemented these programs because it was fashionable to do so, or launched programs because they now had the technology to do so. However, most marketers were motivated by the hope that loyalty programs would improve loyalty. They anticipated great business results, with large increases in sales and profit. 75

However, as discussed in Chapter 1, marketing strategies that are based on false assumptions will never deliver high returns, no matter how well executed the strategies. The key assumptions that underpinned the large investments in loyalty programs are faulty. Many people assumed that loyalty levels could easily be dramatically improved; that customer defection could be reduced (to zero even); and that existing customers could be encouraged to devote all their purchasing to one brand (100% loyalty). It was assumed this would lead to substantial growth in revenue and profits. It was also mistakenly assumed that targeting a brand’s most loyal customers would generate the greatest return. Enthusiasm for loyalty programs has now waned, and some firms are winding down loyalty programs.
