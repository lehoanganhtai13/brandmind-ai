recognition and deal spotting. Recognition studies show shoppers three prices for an item that are (for example) the normal price, 10% above the normal price and 10% below the normal price. Vanheule and Dreze (2002) applied this approach to consumers, and found that only 13% of shoppers identified the correct price. This suggests that price recognition is also rather poor. In terms of deal spotting, approximately 50% of the time shoppers appear to be able to spot a ‘good deal’ for a particular brand based on being shown a (discounted) price for it.

The conclusion is that while consumers’ knowledge about prices is hazy, an appreciable proportion of consumers has a fair idea about price within a zone of the actual price. Also, consumers do seem to be aware of relativities between brands (i.e. X is usually more expensive than Y), rather than absolute price levels, and that comparison between available brands is more important.

So, will a temporary price promotion have negative after-effects for a brand? The answer is no, but repetitively doing it may have negative after-effects. This is because if consumers commonly encounter low prices and ‘deal’ signals for a brand, their reference price for it will be lowered. Also, customers will get used to seeing price-related information for the brand, which will raise the salience of price (and/or on-deal stickers) and possibly lower the salience of other important brand attributes. US studies (Mela, Gupta & Lehmann 1997; Mela, Jedidi & Bowman 1998) found that more frequent promotions result in heightened sensitivity to price among consumers, as well as slightly longer interpurchase times and slightly higher purchase quantities. That is, consumers learn to not only buy on deal, but to also buy a little more during the price promotion, which results in less frequent purchases.

In terms of long-term adverse effects, competitive retaliation is another factor to consider. Managers tend to over-react to each other’s price reductions (Brodie, Bonfrer & Cutler 1996). More broadly, competitor response to price has been shown to be less than rational, with some firms placing more emphasis on ‘beating’ the competition with low prices than on pursuing profit. Companies that do this tend to depress their profits (Armstrong & Collopy 1996; Armstrong & Green 2007). An interesting example of the destructive potential of a ‘beat the competition’ mentality is the price war between Greyhound and Peter Pan Trailways (Heil & Helsen 2001 p. 86). The price of a bus fare went from $25 to $9.95 to $7 to $6.95, and then Greyhound offered a $4 fare, which was lower than the price it had charged 40 years previously. This rapid, ruinous price descent took place over a short period of three weeks. In extreme cases, price wars can bankrupt multiple players.
