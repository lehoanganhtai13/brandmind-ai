after the buyer has culled most of the other brands). Over time, feature advantages can build mental and physical availability. This means that advantages in a product’s features, while important, are less crucial than the business press makes out. This is especially true for established brands with significant market-based assets.

Another way of putting this is that brands that are easier to buy for more people get bought more. Which reminds me that reasons not to buy can therefore be much more important (to sales) than reasons to buy. Generally, marketers are quite sensitive to ‘reasons not to buy’, or at least to negative publicity. Yet it is not uncommon for marketers to spend much effort trying to communicate a ‘reason to buy’ (Value proposition’, USP, differentiating factor, etc.) and yet be quite blasé about features that turn consumers away. For example, many food products still contain trans fat when they don’t need to. In some countries, this means the product has to carry a small warning (like ‘contains hydrogenated vegetable fat’) – you’d think this would be enough to catch their marketers’ attention and concern.

High prices can also be another reason not to buy. Too many brands are overpriced and also over-discounted. It’s as if marketers know that the price is too high, so out of guilt they regularly discount the product. A brand should be priced competitively: this doesn’t mean cheap and it doesn’t mean it needs to be given away on special. A competitive price is enough to attract and retain customers. An excessive premium gives customers a reason not to buy, a reason to stop, think and reject the brand. Think about the memory structures that this builds (e.g. ‘I don’t buy this brand!’). An excessive price also encourages retailers to launch a private-label competitor. None of this is fixed by occasional discounts.

It’s very difficult to get consumers to notice a brand; when marketers succeed in this, consumers reward the brand with a degree of loyalty (largely due to habit and inertia). However, this can be ruined if they suddenly notice a reason not to buy. Marketers should always be on the look out for such barriers. This is one of the reasons that differentiation needs to be approached with caution: being different and appealing to one group in the market can turn consumers away.

# A final word on how to grow

There are only a few key strategies to grow a brand. You can lower the price (and sacrifice profit margins), but this is self-defeating because the reason a brand wants to grow is to improve sales revenue and margins not reduce them.
