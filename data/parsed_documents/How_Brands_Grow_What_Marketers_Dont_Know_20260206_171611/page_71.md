What about differences in how a brand’s buyers perceive the world? As previously explained, a brand’s buyers hold much the same values as buyers of other brands (see Table 5.8); but what about the buyer’s attitudes towards your brand?

**Table 5.8:** Percentage point deviations from the brand norm: values held by brand users

This data presents a comparative analysis of six credit card brands across five distinct attitudinal statements. The structure is a matrix where each row represents a credit card brand, and each column represents a specific attitude, with numerical values indicating the degree of agreement or disagreement. Key relationships are shown through the varying scores for each brand across attitudes like "Children should express themselves freely," "I am happy with my standard of living," "I can’t bear untidiness," "I try to keep up with technology," and "I always look for special offers." For instance, "Access Lloyds" shows consistent positive scores across most attitudes, suggesting a strong alignment, while "TSB Trust card" exhibits a wider range of scores, indicating more varied attitudinal profiles. The overarching structure is comparative, allowing for direct observation of how different credit card brands are perceived or associated with distinct consumer attitudes.

There is one obvious way that buyers of one brand vary from another: their brand buying. This affects their attitude to brands and their brand knowledge. People tend to have opinions about the brands they buy, and not think or know much about brands they don’t use. Behaviour is a powerful driver of awareness, perceptions and attitudes – something that both academic and market researchers have a tendency to forget.<sup>30</sup>

Attitudes reflect how much a buyer buys the brand, that is, they reflect loyalty. We know that loyalty metrics don’t vary a lot between brands. Consequently, the buyers of brand A have the same opinion of brand A as buyers of brand B have of brand B. I call this the ‘my mum’ phenomenon: my own mother is the best mum in the world, she’s lovely, but she can also be rather annoying sometimes. Does that sound like your mum?

Another lovely example of this was a global survey of tourists conducted by the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.
