It’s difficult to see how it could be dirt cheap to do something that no other brand in the market has been able to do. Note that not a single one of these brands has a defection rate around 25%, not even Ford, which has double the market share of its nearest competitor. Asking a brand like Honda to halve its defection rate is equivalent to asking it to increase its customer base more than thirtyfold! Doing things that no other brand has been able to do, in spite of considerable investments in customer relationship management (CRM) and other customer satisfaction initiatives, is seldom cheap or easy.

# Amazing maths

The implications of the double jeopardy law for growth potential are profound, and can be shown with simple maths. Consider Tables 3.1 and 3.2, each year a car brand gains about half its sales from new customers and about half from returning customers. If a brand like Toyota were to reduce its defection rate to zero then it would gain 50% more sales, which is one percentage point of market share. This one point of share is the maximum it can gain from improving retention. But each year about half of new car buyers switch brands, so each year 50 points of market share are up for grabs. This is the most Toyota can gain from improving acquisition, that is, 50 times the sales potential that retention offers!

Most service industries have defection levels far lower than these examples. Figures of 3-5% are quite normal, so even if a company could miraculously reduce defection to zero it would give them a sales gain of only a few percentage points. In market after market the potential gains from acquisition dwarf the potential gains from reducing defection.
