A meta-analysis of 207 US split-cable advertising weight tests concluded that only one of the measured strategy variables was correlated with larger sales effects – i.e. having the objective of increasing penetration (Lodish et al. 1995 p.130).

While an analysis (Binet & Field 2007) of 880 entries to the IPA’s Effectiveness Awards showed that winners were far more likely to have set targets to increase market penetration. Each entrant stated their primary business purpose: for 178 entrants, this was ‘customer retention/increase loyalty’, while for 79 entrants it was ‘new customer acquisition/penetration’. Here’s how the awards played out:

**Table 2.6:** Analysis of the IPA’s Effectiveness Awards

This data presents a comparative analysis of customer engagement, specifically focusing on "Penetration" and "Loyalty," across different customer segments categorized by their award status: "Gold winners," "Silver winners," "Bronze winners," and "No medal." The structure highlights how these award tiers correlate with the percentage of customers exhibiting penetration and loyalty behaviors. Notably, "Gold winners" show the highest penetration at 21% and a modest 2% loyalty, while "Silver winners" exhibit 20% penetration and 6% loyalty. "Bronze winners" have 18% penetration and 3% loyalty. Conversely, the "No medal" segment, representing the largest customer group at 41% penetration, demonstrates a significantly higher loyalty rate of 89%. The data concludes with a total of 100% for both penetration and loyalty, indicating these represent the complete customer base within each category.

Campaigns that, unfashionably, aimed to increase penetration were more than twice as likely to report very large improvements in all hard measures of effectiveness including sales and profits. This pattern was strongest for durables and services. Yet only half the number of submissions aimed to increase penetration as aimed for loyalty/retention improvements or to change attitudes. Therefore, marketers are using the wrong targets.

UPDATE: Since the first version of “How Brands Grow” was published, Binet & Field have updated their analysis in a 2013 IPA report titled “The Long & the Short of It: balancing short and long term marketing strategies”. This time with a larger database covering 30 years of marketing campaigns, and 996 campaigns, they again report “across the board, campaigns targeting new customers outperform campaigns targeting existing customers. In terms of the average number of business effects reported, the former are three times as effective as those targeting existing customers” (p.24).

Les Binet confided to me that he once wrote an effectiveness awards submission where he and his client aimed to increase penetration in the north and loyalty in the south. Annoyingly, while loyalty did improve in the south, penetration there improved even more. Try as one might, if you are successful in gaining sales it’s unlikely you’ll break the double jeopardy law.
