People watch movies, listen to music and read books largely for an emotional ride. They enjoy gaining the same from advertising and when they get it they pay more attention.

# Memory is everything

Apart from a very small amount of direct-response advertising (including online search engine advertising), advertising must work through memories. This is an uncontroversial statement, yet it is common for marketers and academics to forget the essential role of memory; instead, they think advertising works largely through persuasive arguments or by creating emotional feelings about a brand.

Memory is the link between an ad and brand choice. Even a frequently purchased item (e.g. margarine) is only bought, on average, eight times a year, and any single brand is only typically bought once or twice a year (Nielsen 2007). There can be many months between exposure to an ad and when the viewer is in a shopping situation with a relevant opportunity to recall brand memories (which are possibly influenced by the ad). To influence behaviour, advertising must work with people’s memories.

# Advertising builds mental availability

The dominant way that advertising works is by refreshing, and occasionally building, memory structures. These structures improve the chance of a brand being noticed and/or recalled in buying situations; this in turn increases the chance of a brand being bought. Memory structures that relate to a brand include what the brand does, what it looks like, where it is available, when and where it is consumed, by who and with whom. Memories are associations with cues that can bring a brand to mind. They can also remind consumers to take it out of their pantry and eat it.

This is quite a different mechanism from the traditional view that advertising for a new product makes people aware of it and then hopefully wins them over (creates positive attitude) such that they either seek it out, or when in a choice situation evaluate it positively. Instead the sales effect is more due to the fact that the advertising ‘opens peoples eyes’, they now have a chance of seeing it in the store, or down the street, or on the webpage. Whereas without the advertising, they would go on noticing and buying their usual brands – they just would not see or recall the brand. Remember consumers don’t see most things in store, and its terribly difficult for new brands to be seen, let alone understood.
