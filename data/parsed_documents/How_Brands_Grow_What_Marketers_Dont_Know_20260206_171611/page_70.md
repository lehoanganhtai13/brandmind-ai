Table 5.6 shows that the demographic breakdown fluctuates across Yorkie varieties, partly due to random sampling variation, but the obvious pattern is that a lot of women buy Yorkie – they make up about half of its customer base.  
Table 5.4 showed that, like other categories, there is little difference in the user profile for different credit cards. But one financial institution said, “Our brand is different”, and they seemed to have a case. This Australian credit card gives a small donation to a local maternity hospital for every dollar that users spend on the card. It even features a picture of a baby on the card itself.

It is obvious that this card would have a customer base skewed towards women. Not just because the card would appeal to women but also because it wouldn’t appeal to groups like young men (and maybe even young women). The marketing department told us this must be the case. But then the data came in (see Table 5.7). Cardholders are ever slightly more likely to be female than non-cardholders; but they are also more likely to be single and no more likely to have children. It appears that you don’t have to be a mother to value this credit card.

This table presents a demographic breakdown of a population, categorizing individuals by gender and household composition. The primary division is between males and females, each represented as a percentage of the total. Further segmentation occurs within these gender groups based on their relationship status and family structure. These categories include singles, couples without children, families with children, and an 'other' classification for individuals not fitting the preceding descriptions. The data structure allows for a comparative analysis of how different household types are distributed across genders, offering insights into family structures and relationship statuses within the surveyed population.
