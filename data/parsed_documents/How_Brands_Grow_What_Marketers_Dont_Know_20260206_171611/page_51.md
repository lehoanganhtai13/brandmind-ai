This data presents a comparative analysis of Pepsi purchase frequency and its correlation with the percentage of cola buyers. Initially, when Pepsi is bought 0 times, 50% of cola buyers purchase it. As the number of times Pepsi is bought increases, the percentage of cola buyers purchasing Pepsi shows a sharp decline. For instance, at 1 purchase, this figure drops to 12%, and further decreases to 8% at 2 purchases, and 5% at 3 purchases. This downward trend continues, with the percentage of cola buyers steadily decreasing as purchase frequency rises. By 10 purchases, the percentage is 0.5%, and it reaches 0.1% by 16 purchases. Beyond 20 purchases, the percentage stabilizes at a low of 0.05%, remaining constant up to 52 purchases, indicating a diminishing impact of higher purchase frequencies on the overall proportion of cola buyers.

> **If you buy yourself a Pepsi more than 3 times a year then you are one of Pepsi’s heavy buyers!**

Is the UK cola market strange? What does the US look like? Figure 4.3 shows the purchasing pattern (this time at household level) of Coke and Pepsi in the US in 2012. The UK and US buying patterns are astonishingly similar because this pattern generalises around the world, over time, across product categories, and for all the different market research providers. This pattern is nothing to do with soft-drink, it concerns all markets.

This time the population base is all shoppers not just cola buyers so the penetrations are lower (more zero buyers). Clearly both of these large brands have plenty of room to recruit consumers.
