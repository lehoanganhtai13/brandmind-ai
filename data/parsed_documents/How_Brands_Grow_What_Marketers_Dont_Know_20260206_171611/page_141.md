Advertising’s crucial role is in shaping people’s brains so that the brand can be seen.

# Advertising can sometimes persuade consumers

Some advertising creates an intention to purchase by generating a reaction like “I should buy that” or “That’s interesting, I really must check that out”. Some persuasive messages are very dry and rational; for example, classified advertising, directory advertising, search advertising, new product advertising, newspapers and brochures. Typically, directory and search advertising is informative, concise and organised according to the interests of the audience. For example, plumber X guaranteeing a visit within the day to your area might be all the persuasion you need when your hot water system fails. However, to persuade consumers to buy a new product, the market needs to be informed of what is on offer. The excitement of something new provides a window of opportunity: there is enough inherent emotion that an ad (that provides rational information) may get noticed.

However, persuasive arguments are more powerful if they include explicit emotional appeals. For example, compare these two appeals:

* _Goodyear tyres grip the road and this means that they reduce your stopping distance._
* _Today your child’s life may depend on your braking ability. Goodyear tyres reduce your stopping distance and keep your loved ones safe._

Persuasive advertising occurs less than advertising texts and models would have us believe 74. Even in political elections, where one would think that political parties really are trying to persuade voters that their policies and candidates are best, an extremely common advertisement shows nothing more than the name and face of the candidate along with party branding, and maybe a cunningly crafted message along the lines of “vote for X”.
