Only half (or less) of the respondents who agreed with the statement (“Bank X is friendly and helpful”) agreed when interviewed again. However, this does not mean that people are becoming increasingly cynical about how banks serve them. Overall, the brands get very similar scores survey to survey (RL2 is very similar to the previous RL1), because every person who no longer votes for the brand is matched by someone who now votes for it (i.e. some of the people who did not agree with this statement on the first interview do so on the second). This instability in individuals’ response does not mean that those who agreed on the first interview but not the second have fundamentally changed their minds about the brand. It’s just that they sometimes think this, so on some interviews you catch them saying it, and some you don’t.

This phenomenon applies to all brands, and to all image beliefs, attitudes, purchase intentions and most awareness measures. Table 7.4 gives examples across different attitudinal or image statements and across different categories. We can see that the repeat rate varies from brand to brand; it also varies across different beliefs. That’s because the repeat rate largely depends on the overall response (agreement) level for that belief and brand. Logically, if on each survey 100% of respondents agreed with a statement (e.g. “How Brands Grow is a superb book”) then the repeat rate must also be 100% – each survey can only record a score of 100%. However, for beliefs that score less than 100% their repeat rate could be 100% or it could be lower (i.e. a score of 30% in each survey could be because 30% of people agree on every interview, or everyone agrees but only 30% of the time, or something in between). In the real world we find the repeat agreement level is almost always far lower than 100%. In fact we can predict the repeat rate based on the level of initial agreement (Dall’Olmo Riley 1997) – this is the whole story, the repeat rate has surprisingly little to do with the type of belief or other factors.<sup>50</sup>

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand image beliefs across different service categories, specifically contrasting initial agreement percentages with repeated agreement percentages. For fast food outlets, the belief "Good for a snack" shows a significant increase from 29% initial to 56% repeated agreement. Banks exhibit similar patterns, with "Progressive" rising from 22% to 47% and "Expert in the areas it deals in" from 21% to 48%. Insurance sees a substantial jump for "Provides fast service" from 17% to 42%. Supermarkets, with the belief "Sells low-quality fruit," move from 14% to 36% repeated agreement. Finally, liquor/spirits, under the belief "Unique," also demonstrates growth from 10% to 36% repeated agreement. The overarching structure highlights how repeated exposure or experience with a brand can positively influence consumer perception, often more than initial impressions, across diverse industries.
