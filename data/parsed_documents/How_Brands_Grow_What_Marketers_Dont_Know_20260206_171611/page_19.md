* When should 15-second television ads be used?

Yet it is difficult to find answers to such practical questions, let alone to find explanatory and predictive theories that can be used to provide the solutions.

A good colleague of mine, Scott Armstrong, Professor at the Wharton School, once put marketing principles texts to the test (Armstrong & Schultz 1992, pp. 253-65). He asked four doctoral students to independently go through nine leading texts looking for managerial principles. They found many (566) normative (‘you should do’) statements, but the texts failed to accompany the statements with supporting empirical evidence. The students only found twenty statements that were clear and meaningful. When these twenty statements were sent to marketing professors they rated only half as true, and said they knew of supporting evidence for only two. Only one single statement was universally rated as true, supported by evidence, as well as being considered managerially useful. But this principle was also rated as “unsurprising, even to someone who had never taken a marketing course”. 6

We could dismiss our texts as harmless introductions to marketing practice, but marketing texts aren’t harmless, because they routinely lead managers astray. Texts tell us what to worry about (customer satisfaction, image perceptions, brand equity, loyalty), what we should be doing (segmentation, targeting), what techniques to use, and what metrics to measure. Marketing texts largely reflect and reinforce current practice and existing beliefs. They contain a lot of good basic information, like telling us that if we want to advertise we should remember to book the media. But texts are also full of myths; the sort of myths that sap the effectiveness and productivity of marketing departments.

Many of the things that we’ve been told are important, such as loyalty programs, are not (see Chapter 11). Many of the ‘facts’ marketing people believe, particularly about brand buying, are incorrect. Furthermore, many marketers lack the deep knowledge necessary to ask the questions that will lead to new valuable insights.

Take the following test on strategic assumptions (Table 1.1). Marketing professionals agree that these assumptions really matter and underpin strategic marketing decisions that are linked to substantial expenditure. How would you and your marketing colleagues answer these questions? Would there be consensus?
