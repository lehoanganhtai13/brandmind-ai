# Chapter 12:  
## Mental and Physical Availability  
### Byron Sharp  

----

The key marketing task is to make a brand always easy to buy for every buyer; this requires building mental and physical availability. Everything else is secondary. Brands largely compete in terms of physical and mental (brand salience) availability. Even product innovation largely works, when it works, through enhancing mental availability and gaining further distribution. Building mental availability requires reach, distinctiveness (clear branding) and consistency. The brand is seen/noticed, recognised and recalled more often. Building physical availability requires breadth and depth of distribution in space and in time. Together, mental and physical availability make a brand easier to buy for more people, in more situations.

## A new theory of competition for sales

We have a collection of scientific laws of marketing – law-like patterns that hold very widely and under known conditions (see the complete list of marketing laws on pages vii-viii). These laws can be used to predict and explain marketing patterns, but it would also be useful to have a theory that could weave these laws into a memorable, overarching story that can guide our marketing strategy.

**Table 12.1:** The new consumer behavior model

This table illustrates a shift in consumer behavior paradigms, moving from a "Past World View" to a "New World View." The initial perspective emphasizes "Attitude Drives Behavior," categorizing consumers into "Brand Loyals," "Brand Switchers," and "Deeply Committed Buyers," all influenced by "Involvement." In contrast, the "New World View" posits that "Behavior Drives Attitude," redefining consumer types as "Loyal Switchers" (appearing twice, suggesting a dual aspect or emphasis), "Uncaring Cognitive Misers" who rely on "Heuristics," and "Emotional Distracted Viewers." This presents a comparative structure, contrasting two distinct models of understanding consumer actions and motivations.

**Table 12.2:** The new brand performance model

This table outlines a framework for Brand Performance, contrasting different strategic approaches. It presents a "Past World View" as a baseline, against which several contemporary strategies are compared. These include "Growth Through Targeting Brand Loyals," which focuses on retaining existing customers, and "Price Promotions Win New," a strategy emphasizing discounts to attract new clientele. The table also highlights potential pitfalls such as "Unpredictable Confusing Brand Metrics," suggesting challenges in accurately measuring brand success. Furthermore, it contrasts approaches like "Target Marketing," which involves focusing on specific customer segments, with "We Compete on Positioning," a strategy centered on establishing a distinct market perception. Finally, "Differentiation" is presented as a key element, implying the importance of unique product or service attributes in achieving brand success. The overall structure appears comparative, evaluating various brand management philosophies and their associated outcomes or challenges. **Table 12.3:** The new advertising model
