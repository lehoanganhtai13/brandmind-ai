This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing, specifically focusing on household spending in dollars per thousand households, under varying conditions of competitive pressure and television advertising exposure. The table displays six distinct dollar values, likely representing different market segments or time periods, with three values ($269, $250, $258) appearing in the first row and three others ($257, $212, $192) in the second. A central theme of "Competitive pressure" is indicated, with a distinction made between a "Pre Period" and the impact of "TV Ads on air." Further segmentation categorizes households as either "Exposed to ads" or "Not exposed to ads," suggesting an investigation into how advertising influences purchasing behavior within a competitive landscape. The structure implies a comparison of spending levels across these different exposure and competitive scenarios.

When more rigorous controls of other causal influences on sales are in place (e.g. Danaher, Bonfrer & Dhar 2008), advertising’s effects on aggregate data *appear* greater, as we would expect; however, with aggregate data this is fiendishly difficult to do, making it astonishingly hard to see advertising’s proper sales effects.

This is a difficult concept to grasp because it seems counterintuitive – advertising causes sales even when weekly sales figures don’t change.

When sales figures do change, this still gives an incorrect indication of the true effect advertising has on sales. Movements in this week’s or month’s sales figures don’t reveal the full sales impact of advertising – they are like the tip of the iceberg but we don’t know what proportion of the total iceberg the tip represents.

This isn’t always the case; for some advertising, the effect on sales occurs immediately. An example of this is the advertising that informs its audience of a time-dependent event, for example, ‘Sale ends this Thursday’.<sup>69</sup> But most advertising affects people who won’t buy the brand for weeks, so the sales effects are spread far into the future. Hence, the effect on sales is spread so thinly over a week’s sales figures, that a change in weight of advertising delivers no visible change in sales trajectory. A little bit of your advertising today works today, but much is to prevent people from being less likely to buy you when they make their next category purchase in months/years time.
