Then, 67 subjects were given brain scans while tasting tiny computer administered squirts of cola dispensed via a plastic tube. An fMRI scan involves lying on a hard flat board inside an extremely loud (and, for some, claustrophobic, chamber). It is not a pleasant experience, and certainly different from most normal consumption situations! The main finding was that when subjects were told that Coke was the cola they were sipping more brain activity was recorded in the hippocampus and in other brain areas thought to be concerned with cultural knowledge and memories. This did not occur quite so much for Pepsi.

What does this convoluted experiment tell us? First, in artificial tasting situations people are far more likely to trust their eyes than their sense of taste, this phenomenon has been observed across decades of taste testing research. They also may react as if it were a test – that their performance is being judged, not just the colas. So informing them that one cup contains their favourite cola (or non-favourite cola) largely overrides their taste buds – which is especially easy when the other cup contains the same cola (i.e. there is no difference between the two cups). Second, the brain scans probably reflect something that psychologists have known for decades: familiarity breeds liking. Usage also breeds familiarity and brand knowledge; this in turn breeds liking.

This is very much what a second widely reported study shows. In this research (Robinson et al. 2007), 63 children aged between three and five years old were given two identical food items to taste. One item was in plain wrapping and the other was in McDonald’s branded wrapping. The food items were McDonald’s hamburgers, chicken McNuggets, McDonald’s French fries, milk, and two baby carrots. With each exposure of a food item, for example, McDonald’s French fries, the child was asked, “Can you tell me which of these foods is from McDonald’s?” If the child did not answer or answered incorrectly the administrator pointed to the McDonald’s branded option and said, “This food is from McDonald’s”; this happened about a third of the time. Each child was then instructed to take a bite of each of the two options and the administrator then asked, “Tell me if they taste the same or point to the food [drink] that tastes best to you”. The children chose the branded option (as tasting best) 182 times. They chose the unbranded option 122 times or said they both tasted the same (or that they did not know).

The more regularly a child ate at McDonald’s (as reported by their parents), the more likely they were to choose the branded item.
