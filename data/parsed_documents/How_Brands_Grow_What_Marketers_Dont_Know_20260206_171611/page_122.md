Most (77%) of Apple users did not perceive their brand to be different or unique. This seems surprising, given that Apple computers look different and use a different operating system<sup>64</sup>. However, most computer users have little technical knowledge and few would know what an operating system was. Apple Macintosh is a personal computer (PC), with a graphical user interface, a mouse and keyboard, it runs software (e.g. Microsoft Office), sends email, surfs the web, stores files, prints and so on. It is not unreasonable that its users see it as doing very much the same things as other computers. They certainly buy it to do the same things. Few apparently bought it because they wanted a computer that was different; they bought it to be a good useful computer – just as buyers of any other computer brand.<sup>65</sup>

**Table 8.4:** Computer brand users’ perceived differentiation

This data presents a comparative analysis of user perceptions across six different computer brands: HP, Toshiba, Compaq, IBM, Apple, and Dell. The analysis focuses on three key metrics: the percentage of users who are "Different" (likely referring to users who are not loyal or are considering switching), the percentage of users who are "Unique" (potentially indicating a distinct user base or preference), and the percentage of users "Associating the brand with either" (a measure of brand recognition or positive association). Across all brands, the average percentage of users in these categories are 9% for "Different," 10% for "Unique," and 14% for "Associating the brand with either." Apple exhibits the highest percentage for "Unique" users (25%) and for "Associating the brand with either" (27%), while IBM shows the highest percentage for "Different" users (16%). Dell consistently shows the lowest percentages across all three metrics, with 5% for each category. The structure is comparative, highlighting variations in user perception for each brand against a set of defined metrics.

Many marketing texts instruct marketers to strive to make customers perceive valued differences between brands. Yet even marketers of highly successful brands seem to have failed. This leads to the conclusion that perceived differentiation plays little part in the success of brands. It is certainly not a case of ‘differentiate or die’; if it were, most of the brands we buy would be gone.

The literature on consumer behaviour has for decades focused on customer perceptions of brand features as the main reason why one brand is chosen over others.

This emphasis is misplaced. If buyers of a brand don’t often think their brand is different or unique, then presumably this is not the main reason they buy it. We need to look elsewhere for explanations of why customers buy one brand and not another.

It seems counterintuitive that buyers do not often notice that the brands they use are somehow different from other brands in the market (given that some of the brands are functionally different).
