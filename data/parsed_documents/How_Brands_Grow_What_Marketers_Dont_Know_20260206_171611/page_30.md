But no shampoo brand in the US is bought six times a year and no shampoo brand commands 100% loyalty. Such a marketing plan is fantasy. Double jeopardy tells us what is, and what isn’t achievable.

Some managers find it difficult to accept that there is a scientific law constraining what they can achieve. But the law leaves plenty of room for marketing creativity. In the same way that laws of physics constrain the creativity of architects in a good way (they wish to design buildings that stand up to gravity, wind and rain), the double jeopardy law simply provides a practical guide to strategy formulation.

# What about new uses – growing the category?

Most of us learned at university that one avenue for sales growth is to show buyers new uses for our product. In an industrial setting, sales people certainly spend time doing this, helping teach clients how to fully use complicated products and services. But what about consumer markets where personal tuition is not affordable? Can a weak force like advertising teach buyers about new, non-obvious, uses for the product?

As a university student I was taught the Arm & Hammer case study. Arm & Hammer is an American brand of sodium bi-carbonate (baking soda), little known outside of the US; Church & Dwight, the company that markets it, controls 75% of the sodium bi-carbonate production in the US. Bi-carb of soda is used by consumers primarily as a raising agent in baking (or for kids to make volcano-type science experiments). The case study said that Arm & Hammer generated sales growth by telling consumers they could use their baking soda for things like absorbing bad smells in the fridge or exfoliating your skin. Arm & Hammer still today tell people about these uses (at least on their web site).

The Arm & Hammer case study was already an old example back when I was an undergraduate, yet I still hear it used, which is suspicious. Perhaps it’s the only successful case? McDonald’s teaching the market to think of them for breakfast is perhaps a more verifiable and current example. Though in this case the ‘new use’ was far from radical and easy to communicate.

It would seem logically possible for a brand to point out new uses for the category (e.g. salt helps with red wine stains), and this might stimulate growth – though for all brands in the category. However, things that are logically possible can, in the real world, turn out to be practically extremely difficult or unlikely.
