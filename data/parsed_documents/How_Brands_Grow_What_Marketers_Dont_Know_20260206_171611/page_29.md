Among the submissions for the Advertising Effectiveness Awards – run by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) – 82% reported large penetration growth, 6% reported both penetration and loyalty growth, and only 2% reported loyalty growth alone.

Double Jeopardy was first observed in attitudes back in the 1960s, then later in behaviour like choosing which newspaper to read, voting, or store choice. Since then it has been observed everywhere from soap to soap operas - although it is still not well known about. It has been observed for industrial brands, luxury brands, services, stores, store chains, comic strips, newspapers, radio stations, TV networks, TV programs, politicians, and so on. Double Jeopardy has been documented in numerous countries, and local regional markets within them. Here is an example of industrial buying:

**Table 2.5:** Double Jeopardy in Ready Mix Concrete selling to building firms

This data presents a comparative analysis of seven concrete suppliers (A through G) operating in West Yorkshire, UK, detailing their market penetration and average purchase frequency. Supplier A demonstrates the highest market penetration at 46%, alongside the highest average number of purchases in the last three months at 2.96. As market penetration decreases among suppliers B through G, the average number of purchases also generally declines. Suppliers B, C, and D show moderate market penetration (36% to 31%) with average purchases ranging from 1.54 to 1.27. Suppliers E and F exhibit identical figures, with 26% market penetration and 1.03 average purchases. Supplier G has the lowest market penetration at 16% and the lowest average number of purchases at 0.83. The structure highlights a correlation between market penetration and customer purchase frequency across these regional concrete suppliers.

# Double Jeopardy - A quantitative guide for growth targets

The double jeopardy law tells us what our marketing metrics will look like, if we are successful in gaining sales and market share. If Finesse (in Table 2.4) were to catapult up to the sales level of Suave Naturals or Pantene, it would be substantially more popular with millions more households buying it each year. But these households would not, on average, buy it much more often than current Finesse households buy the brand.

Finesse’s brand manager could plan to reach market leadership by getting current customers to buy eight times a year. That would be enough to do it – in theory. But in practice that is impossible. Finesse-buying households currently only buy shampoo six times a year; therefore Finesse would need to command 100% loyalty just to achieve six purchases per year per customer.
