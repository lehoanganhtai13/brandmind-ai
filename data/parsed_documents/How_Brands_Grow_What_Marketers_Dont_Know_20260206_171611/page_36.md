One reason it is harder than expected to cross-sell products to existing buyers is that those who haven’t bought these products from you don’t need them; for example, you can’t sell car insurance to someone who drives a company car. Another neglected reason is that service brands often already enjoy high loyalty; for example, most of your customers who needed a home loan came to you already (and you either gave them one or turned them down). So improving this already high loyalty is difficult.

# And profits?

It’s often naively hoped that investing in current customers might yield greater net returns than seeking to expand the customer base. The simplest idea is to spend the most on heaviest customers and the least on the lightest. It assumes that heavy customers (i.e. those that buy more of the brand) are the best candidates for investment. I call this the ‘Heavy Buyer Fallacy’ because the misguided logic confuses past/current buying with growth potential – when it’s more reasonable to think that heavy customers are already buying all that they ever will. It seems logical that a firm can afford to spend more on a heavy customer than a light one; certainly direct marketing managers find it easier to justify sending expensive letters to heavier customers, and very hard to justify spending several dollars on customers who deliver less than this in sales revenue. However the key issue is what this marketing expenditure will return (What change will it evoke?), so even customers who are currently worth nothing may be worth marketing to in order to win their future custom.

Another fallacy is that customers who stay longer will become more profitable as they somehow become less price sensitive. Rienartz & Kumar (2000, 2002) investigated profitability and tenure using data from a US catalogue retailer, a French retail food business, and a German direct brokerage, and found that a customer’s tenure did a surprisingly poor job of predicting their lifetime profitability, because even short-term customers could generate a good deal of profit. Their cohort analysis partly explains this by showing that customers did not become more profitable over time, nor did long tenure clients pay higher prices. In industrial settings this may due to long-standing customers extracting better terms and discounts. In consumer settings long-standing customers may learn to pick the very best value items from a firm’s portfolio, or learn when price discounts are offered.
