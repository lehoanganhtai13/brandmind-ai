This data, sourced from Spaeth & Hess (1989) and presented as Figure 1.3, illustrates the composition of the Colgate consumer base, categorizing customers into three distinct groups: "One time buyers," "Loyals," and "Switchers." The table presents two distinct breakdowns of these consumer segments. In the first instance, "One time buyers" constitute 16% of the base, "Loyals" represent 38%, and "Switchers" make up the largest segment at 46%. A subsequent, potentially contrasting or updated, analysis shows "One time buyers" at 11%, "Loyals" at 21%, and "Switchers" at a significantly higher 68%. This structure highlights a comparative analysis of consumer segmentation within the Colgate customer base, emphasizing the relative proportions of each buyer type across two different data points or analyses.

The percentage of Colgate’s sales that came from loyal customers is almost half that of Crest’s loyals (‘loyals’ being people who bought the brand for the majority of their toothpaste purchasing during the analysis period). Colgate’s sales come much more from ‘switchers’ – people who bought Colgate at least once in the analysis period, although most of their buying was of other brands.
