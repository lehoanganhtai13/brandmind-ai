A realistic explanation for this loyalty is that Apple owners would have to swap operating systems, and perhaps replace software, if they switch away from Apple. In comparison, a Gateway owner can switch to HP or Dell (or many dozens of other brands) and use the same operating system and software.

This factor alone sufficiently explains Apple’s slight loyalty advantage, leaving little room for the effect of passionate commitment. This is not to say that Harley-Davidson and Apple don’t have brand fanatics, but these customers are a small group, and their numbers are not much larger than the number of passionate fans of competitor brands.

UPDATE – When the first edition of *How Brands Grow* was published this computer repurchase data was already almost ten years old. I liked it because it was from a period where Apple was most certainly not a mass market brand and reports of its stellar loyalty were common, but like many people I wondered if anything had changed. Also, it’s never good to rely on a single set of data (even if it does fit well-established patterns). So with Katherine Anderson I undertook a simple survey asking people what brand of computer they currently had, and what was the brand of their previous computer. Katherine is an expert on the validity of on-line panels for different sorts of questions. We wondered if computer usage might vary between on-line panels; it’s quite reasonable to expect that online panels would skew to heavier computer users (this shows up in things like their Facebook usage). Then again this is complicated by the fact that panel providers may take deliberate steps to reduce this bias, and different providers may differ in their success in doing this. So we commissioned the data collection from three different online panels, each now reported separately.

The results from all three surveys, using the three different US online panel providers, each show the same double jeopardy pattern as the original MetaFacts data ten years earlier. Apple is no loyalty leader.

This data presents a comparative analysis of two computer brands, Dell and HP/Compaq, based on their share of a survey sample and customer repeat purchase rates. HP/Compaq represents a slightly larger portion of the survey sample at 30%, compared to Dell at 29%. However, Dell demonstrates a significantly higher customer loyalty, with 50% of its surveyed customers indicating they would make a repeat purchase. In contrast, HP/Compaq has a lower repeat purchase rate of 36%. The structure is comparative, highlighting key performance indicators for each brand to facilitate a direct assessment of their market presence and customer retention. **Data source – Survey using Research Now online panel, n=400, December 2011.**
