The survey asked the tourists to describe why they chose their last holiday destination. The open-ended, qualitative responses were collated for each destination; unexpectedly, the researchers noticed a high degree of similarity in the responses for each destination, for example:

* somewhere new and exciting  
* interesting people and culture  
* nice shopping  
* somewhere to relax.

Obviously people did not talk about the snow if they went to a beach location, or the surf if they went to a mountain. But aside from these descriptive differences, the tourists’ stated motivations and benefits were uncannily similar. This is another way that a brand’s customer base is similar to that of other brands.

# Different variants

Brand managers often add variants – also known as stock-keeping units (SKU) – to their brand in the belief that this allows the brand to reach different buyers. Let’s look at variants. They are interesting because their clear functional differences could mean they are used by different people.

Table 5.9 shows the normal market shares for regular (63% share) and diet/no sugar (35% share) soft drinks, and then their market shares in particular demographic groups. This sort of analysis, popular in market research reports (where indices are often used) can exaggerate differences in that it is possible to have an unusually high share, but in a tiny demographic group, so that your overall customer base isn’t much different. I’ve deliberately chosen this style of analysis to show even tiny potential differences, but as you can see there isn’t much to show. Read the table downwards for each variant. Regular soft drink has an overall share of about two-thirds – it also has this share in each demographic. Diet soft drink has a share of about one-third, both overall and also in each demographic sub-group. So neither variant appeals especially to any particular segment (and that’s in spite of years of diet soft drink advertising trying to target women).<sup>31</sup>

**Table 5.9:** Gender profile of different types of soft drink

This table presents a comparative analysis of market share for regular and diet soft drinks within a specific demographic group. It aims to illustrate the relative popularity and consumer preference between these two product categories. The structure is straightforward, with distinct columns for each soft drink type and rows (implicitly, though not detailed in the provided snippet) that would represent different demographic segments or time periods. The core comparison lies in the percentage of market share held by regular versus diet soft drinks, allowing for an assessment of which product type is more dominant or preferred within the targeted demographic. The data would likely reveal trends or disparities in consumption patterns, highlighting the success of one category over the other. Overall market                  63     35
