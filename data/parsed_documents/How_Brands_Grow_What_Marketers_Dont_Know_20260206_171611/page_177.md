* Buyers are polygamously loyal; they have personal repertoires of brands that they purchase repeatedly; they are seldom 100% loyal, and are never exclusively loyal in the long term. Therefore, competing brands share consumers; they do so with every other brand in the category, and how much they share depends on the other brand’s market share. For example, all soft drink brands share more customers with Coca-Cola than with Fanta. Also, when soft drink brands gain sales, they steal sales from all the other brands in proportion to the market share of the other brands. Partitions of brands that share more or less of their buyers with each other are weak – all brands in a category compete as if they were close substitutes in spite of their physical or perceived differences. Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke do share buyers more than predicted, but both still share far more of their buyers with Coca-Cola and any other brands with a large market share.

These empirical patterns show that brands largely compete as branded versions of the product category, with their function, image and price differentiation (within limits) being of surprisingly low importance.

# Mental availability

Mental availability or brand salience is the propensity for a brand to be noticed and/or thought of in buying situations<sup>91</sup>. The term brand salience is sometimes used synonymously with top-of-mind brand awareness measures (e.g. the first financial institution recalled when asked, ‘Which financial institutions can you name?’). However, in referring to mental availability we mean more than that. There is a real problem with all brand-awareness measures that assume the link to the name of the product category is all that needs to be measured.

Mental availability is based on the network structure in buyers’ memories. For example, memory associations for a bank brand include:
* a branch near work
* home loans
* internet banking
* friends bank there
* a branch on high street
* someone I know worked there * can get cash out
