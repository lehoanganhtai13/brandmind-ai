In this case there are a number of growth impediments. First, it’s hard to get people to change their habits. Consider that dentists have been telling people to brush their teeth at least twice a day but the average is stubbornly stuck at less than two, with the most common being once a day.

Unilever tried to tell men to spray the body deodorant Axe all over (as a perfume in effect) but it failed to drive usage – people know you spray deodorant under arms, and habits are hard to change. Second, it’s hard to build non-obvious mental structures, for example, if people think of your brand as a baking product then it’s hard for them to think of it as a fridge deodorant. Hands up all of you who have a box of bi-carbonate soda in your fridge absorbing stray smells – I’m guessing not many of you. And, third, few brands have sufficient advertising budgets to change how the population thinks about a product category. Advertising works best when it tells us things we already believe. It’s strongest at refreshing existing memory structures, not building new, non-obvious ones. Categories do grow, and shrink, over time; and consumers, do find uses for products that even their manufacturers didn’t think of. But these changes are seldom driven by advertising, perhaps nudged along a bit, but seldom driven.

For a single brand, with its small ad budget, to change people’s category habits seems very difficult. Certainly not without making changes to physical availability, for example, Arm & Hammer being stocked in the cleaning or cosmetic sections of supermarkets.

I wonder how successful Arm & Hammer was at increasing usage of baking soda. Certainly some people were using it for more than baking before they started promoting it that way (this was probably Arm & Hammer’s inspiration). I suspect that their gains were rather modest. Interestingly, Arm & Hammer have, over the years, entered new product categories, like cleaning products and toothpaste, with bicarbonate soda based formulations. Perhaps the real story here is that they found that they couldn’t change people’s habits to use that box of baking soda in different ways, so instead of trying to change people they brought the soda to the traditional products people used.

In short, the aim of growing category purchases through presenting new uses often turns out to be a pipe-dream. That’s why marketers who want to increase sales need to win more market share and/or enter new markets.

# Penetration the winning target One sound principle that is taught at business school is that you are far more likely to succeed if you have the right goal.
