As brands get bigger (i.e. gain market share) their metrics move in the opposite direction to the metrics of brands that are shrinking. Bigger brands have higher penetration and loyalty metrics (both attitudinal and behavioural). This pattern doesn’t fit with many old theories of how markets work. But this is the way the real world works. This suggests that marketing metrics, including market share, all reflect one thing: popularity. Therefore, brands vary in their popularity, and everything flows from that. Also, two rival brands with similar levels of popularity will have very similar metrics.

These patterns are so robust that a single mathematical model predicts many of the laws in this book. This model is the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice and purchase rates (usually simply called ‘the Dirichlet’) developed by Gerald Goodhardt, Andrew Ehrenberg and Chris Chatfield (see Ehrenberg, Uncles Goodhardt, 2004; Goodhardt, Ehrenberg Chatfield, 1984). It is a model about consumers/buyers. It assumes that buying behaviour is heterogeneous and probabilistic; in other words, we each have a certain propensity to buy (some of us buy more often than others) and a certain propensity to buy particular brands (we each have our own preferences or personal repertoires). The Dirichlet is 30 years old and has survived 30 years of testing. It is one of marketing science’s greatest achievements; for more information, see www.MarketingScience.info.

The law-like patterns (empirical laws) that are introduced in this book are:

* **Double jeopardy law:** Brands with less market share have far fewer buyers, and these buyers are slightly less loyal (in their buying and attitudes). For implications see Chapter 2.

* **Retention double jeopardy:** All brands lose some buyers; this loss is proportionate to their market share (i.e. big brands lose more customers; though these represent a smaller proportion of their total customer base). For implications see Chapter 3.

* **Pareto law: 60/20:** Slightly more than half of a brand’s sales come from the top 20% of its customers. The remaining sales come from the bottom 80% of its customers (i.e. the Pareto law is not 80/20). For implications * **Law of buyer moderation:** In subsequent time periods heavy buyers buy less often (than in the base period that was used to categorise them as heavy buyers).
