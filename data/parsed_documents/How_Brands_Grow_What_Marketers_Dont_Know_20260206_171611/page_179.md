Mental availability depends on a brand’s share of people’s minds, by which I mean the quantity and quality of memory links to and from a brand. Quantity refers to the number of associations a buyer has about a brand name. Quality has two aspects: strength of association and relevance of the attribute. First, some memory links are stronger than others, in that they are more likely to be activated. For example, for some people, the cue ‘Elvis Presley’ may always bring fried peanut butter sandwiches to mind and vice versa<sup>93</sup>. For these people, this is a strong association – yet for many others this may be a very occasional association. Second, some memory links are more relevant to buying situations than others. Elvis Presley is unlikely to be a cue that people encounter when they are in a position to buy peanut butter. However, this association is not entirely unimportant, as hearing an Elvis song increases the chance of people thinking about peanut butter, and by doing so, enhancing links to cues that do occur during buying situations.

When a brand scores well on traditional awareness measures but its sales are disappointing, the common conclusion is that buyers don’t like the brand. However, the problem can be that, while buyers know of the brand (and find it acceptable), they seldom think of it or notice it when they are in buying situations.

Buyers use different cues when retrieving brands as buying options. For example, cues for something to eat in the morning may include something low in fat, something healthy and something quick. Buyers may also use more abstract cues – like colour and the style or size of the packaging – to identify and notice specific brands. They may be totally unaware of the cues they are utilising.

By building memory links to attributes marketers can increase:  
* the number of people who think of a particular brand  
* the number of times each person thinks of a particular brand as an option (to buy).

Linking a brand to attributes means the brand now has some probability to be bought; this is an infinitely higher chance of being bought than when the brand was not thought of at all.

No consumer is wedded to one attribute all the time. This is a common mistake made in segmentation research. For example, rarely is someone always interested in buying something healthy in a product category (or in life!). The typical buyer might be thinking healthy one time, convenient next time and a treat the time after.
