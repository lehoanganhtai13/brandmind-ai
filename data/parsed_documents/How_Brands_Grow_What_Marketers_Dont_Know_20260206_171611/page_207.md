# How can a new brand build mental availability when it has no distinctive assets?

It’s very difficult as everyone knows. My first advice is to follow the guidelines in this book closely, it’s risky enough launching a new brand there is isn’t the luxury of ‘breaking the rules’. There will be certain memory structures that have to be planted in consumers’ heads or they simply won’t notice the brand, don’t forget these in your efforts to tell people how wonderful your new brand is – stick to the fundamentals. See rule 4 in chapter 12.

A brand with no distinctive assets has to build some. One shortcut is to work with what already exists in people’s heads, that is, borrow memory structures where you can.

# Should a brand seek to build mental or physical availability first?

Both work together, physical availability is of little value if consumers don’t notice the brand, and advertising is of little value if the brand is physically difficult to obtain. This is one advantage of big brands, their advertising works better because of their wide physical availability, and their physical availability is supported by efficient mass media.

One tactic for new brands is to grow gradually one geographical area at a time. If you can buy media to match your geographical availability then a small advertising budget can be put to use to buy large share-of-voice in that restrictive geographical region.

# Hasn’t the internet and new media changed everything?

The digital revolution is certainly exciting, offering new ways of reaching consumers, new ways of building mental and physical availability, and new data on buying behaviour. However, there is mounting evidence that changes in consumer behaviour have been far more modest than ‘experts’ predicted. All the talk of ‘frictionless commerce’, perfect information, the death of brands has turned out to be as good as predictions of flying cars.

Ten years ago we told our Ehrenberg-Bass Institute sponsors that predictions of the death of TV were ridiculous, as we showed predictable patterns of TV viewing (scientific laws) that had held through massive social and technological change, and continued to hold.
