Here are the ‘brand insights’ the market research agency reports:

* Colgate’s sales volume comes mostly from non-loyal buyers  
* Colgate is 50% more dependent on switchers than Crest  
* Colgate buyers are less loyal, both behaviourally and attitudinally  
* Even Colgate buyers think Crest is a quality product  
* Colgate is a quality product but it has perception problems and lacks loyalty  
* Colgate is attracting the wrong sort of buyer.

These insights are translated into the following action recommendations. Colgate needs:

* more persuasive advertising that stresses Colgate’s quality  
* comparative advertisements against Crest (common in the USA)  
* media schedules that emphasise frequency of exposure (to shift attitudes)  
* research to profile Colgate ‘loyals’ with the aim of attracting more people like this.

All this sounds perfectly normal. It happens in marketing departments around the world every day. You personally may have come up with a somewhat different marketing strategy, depending on your own experience, preferences, and creativity, but the insights and the strategy appear reasonable, and not unusual. Except that they are wrong.

The ‘insights’ suggested here reflect ignorance of relevant scientific laws about buyer behaviour and marketing metrics, laws that we’ll cover in this book.
