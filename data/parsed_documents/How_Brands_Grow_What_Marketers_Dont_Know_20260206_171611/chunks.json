      "content": "Marketing is a creative profession. So is architecture: architects design masterpieces like the Taj Mahal and the Sydney Opera House, but architects use their creativity within a framework of physical laws. Architects must design buildings that will not collapse under their own weight or blow over in a breeze; they cannot choose to ignore the law of gravity, or hope their building is immune to the laws of physics.\n\nMarketers, even senior marketing academics, like to say that there can be no laws concerned with marketing. These people argue that consumers are far too individual and unpredictable. Research has shown this is utter nonsense. This ill-founded belief stops academics doing their job and searching for law-like patterns in buying behaviour and marketing effects. It also allows marketers to carry on with ‘anything goes’ marketing plans. Imagine if architects designed ‘anything goes’ plans – “Let’s build out of fairy-floss’, ‘Let’s add another 68 floors!”\n\nMarketers argue with each other about things that have nothing to do with the creativity of the discipline; about things that should be known for certain. It’s time for this to stop. This book reveals the predictable patterns in how buyers buy, and how sales grow – things all marketers should know, not argue about.\n\nThese patterns are valuable knowledge. It’s often thought that great marketing strategy is obvious – with hindsight everyone can see what you did and copy you. This might be true for new products or some advertising campaigns, but in reality marketing offers the ability to outperform competitors while they scratch their heads wondering why on earth you are doing so well. Unfortunately, marketers themselves often have no idea why one of their own campaigns worked and others did not. Their explanations as to what they got right or wrong are often wide of the mark because their assumptions (theories in their head) are wrong.\n\nThis book is for marketers who are willing to learn new things based on classical science, and to shake off the superstition (and unfounded speculation) that today passes for marketing theory.\n\nRead the assumptions in Table 1.\n\n**Table 1:** Marketing assumptions",

Growth in market share comes by increasing popularity; that is, by gaining many more buyers (of all types), most of whom are light customers buying the brand only very occasionally.\n2. Brands, even though they are usually slightly differentiated, mainly compete as if they are near lookalikes; though they vary in popularity (and 3.\n\nBrand competition and growth is largely about building two market-based assets: physical availability and mental availability. Brands that are easier to buy – for more people, in more situations – have more market share. Innovation and differentiation (when they work) build market-based assets, which last after competitors copy the innovation.\n\nTherefore, marketers need to improve the branding of their product (i.e. it needs to look like them and only them) and to continuously reach large audiences of light buyers cost effectively. Marketers need to research what their distinctive brand assets are (colours, logos, tone, fonts, etc.); they need to use and protect these. Managers also need to research how buyers buy their brand, when they think of and notice it, and how it fits into their lives (and shopping). Marketers need to manage media and distribution in line with this knowledge.\n\nAdvertising works largely by refreshing, and occasionally building, memory structures (and less by convincing rational minds or winning emotional hearts). Marketers need to research these memory structures and ensure that their advertising refreshes these structures by consistently using the brand’s distinctive assets.\n\nIn short, there is a great deal to learn, and much to be discovered, about sophisticated mass marketing.\n\nTables 3, 4 and 5 summarise old and new aspects of marketing.\n\n**Table 3:** Consumer behaviour",

The \"New World View\" inverts this dynamic, proposing that \"Behavior Drives Attitude.\" This new perspective reclassifies consumers into categories like \"Loyal Switchers\" (appearing under both \"Brand Loyals\" and \"Brand Switchers\" from the past), \"Uncaring Cognitive Misers\" (formerly \"Deeply Committed Buyers\"), and \"Emotional Distracted Viewers\" (formerly \"Rational Involved Viewers\"). This shift is underpinned by the concept of \"Heuristics,\" suggesting a move towards simpler decision-making processes.\n\n**Table 4:** Brand performance\n\nThis table outlines a comparative shift in brand performance strategies, moving from a \"Past World View\" to a \"New World View.\" The core structure is comparative, highlighting contrasting approaches across several key areas. In the past, growth was primarily sought through targeting existing brand loyals, whereas the new approach emphasizes growth through penetration. Metrics were previously obscure and proprietary but are now expected to be predictable and transparent. The effectiveness of price promotions has been re-evaluated; they were once seen as a way to win new customers but are now understood to primarily reach existing loyal customers. Marketing strategies have evolved from target marketing to sophisticated mass marketing. Finally, the concept of differentiation has been refined to distinctiveness, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of how brands stand out in the market.\n\n**Table 5:** Advertising\n\nThis table outlines key components of advertising, structured around a \"New World\" perspective. It highlights the importance of \"Positioning\" and \"Message Comprehension\" in crafting effective advertising strategies. Central to this is the identification of \"Unique Selling Propositions\" which are described as \"Relevant.\" The persuasive aspect of advertising is characterized as \"Refreshing,\" suggesting a need for novelty and impact. Furthermore, advertising serves a \"Teaching\" function, implying an educational role in informing consumers. Finally, the deployment of advertising is characterized by \"Campaign Bursts,\" indicating a strategic approach to timing and frequency. The overall structure suggests a framework for modern advertising, emphasizing relevance, persuasion, education, and strategic execution.

Margaret, the Senior Category Manager for toothpaste, is standing at your office door and she is obviously distressed. She is waving a recently received report from your global market research supplier, and this is what it shows:[12]\n\n**Figure 1.1:** Toothpaste brands: US market shares (volume)\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of the volume percentage occupied by two toothpaste brands, Colgate and Crest. Crest accounts for a significantly larger volume percentage at 37%, while Colgate occupies 19%. The structure is a simple comparison, highlighting the relative market share or presence of these two brands based on volume.\n\n*Data source: Spaeth & Hess 1989.*\n\nThe market research shows that Procter & Gamble’s Crest brand of toothpaste has double the market share of Colgate in the US. However, this has long been known and is not the reason why Margaret is upset. It’s the next couple of graphs that have her worried (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3).\n\n**Figure 1.2:** Crest consumer base These charts decompose the sales volume of each rival brand according to the recent repeat-buying behaviour of their consumers.\n\nThis data, sourced from Spaeth & Hess (1989) and presented as Figure 1.3, illustrates the composition of the Colgate consumer base, categorizing customers into three distinct groups: \"One time buyers,\" \"Loyals,\" and \"Switchers.\" The table presents two distinct breakdowns of these consumer segments. In the first instance, \"One time buyers\" constitute 16% of the base, \"Loyals\" represent 38%, and \"Switchers\" make up the largest segment at 46%. A subsequent, potentially contrasting or updated, analysis shows \"One time buyers\" at 11%, \"Loyals\" at 21%, and \"Switchers\" at a significantly higher 68%. This structure highlights a comparative analysis of consumer segmentation within the Colgate customer base, emphasizing the relative proportions of each buyer type across two different data points or analyses.\n\nThe percentage of Colgate’s sales that came from loyal customers is almost half that of Crest’s loyals (‘loyals’ being people who bought the brand for the majority of their toothpaste purchasing during the analysis period). Colgate’s sales come much more from ‘switchers’ – people who bought Colgate at least once in the analysis period, although most of their buying was of other brands.",

What does this mean for her ambitious growth targets?\n\nHow would you answer?\n\nOf course, you would call for more research. It’s an Insight Director’s prerogative.\n\n----\n\nThe additional research further breaks down the market share of each company by analysing the switchers within both the Crest and Colgate customer bases.\n\nThe additional research consists of a survey; the first question of which asks customers about their attitudinal loyalty. Figure 1.4 reports the percentage of switchers who agree with the statement: “This is my preferred brand”, (the switcher group is the interesting one, as we can safely assume that both Crest’s and Colgate’s loyals will report that their brand is their preferred one.) As you can see, Figure 1.4 shows that Crest switchers are substantially more likely to say that Crest is their preferred brand.\n\nThe survey’s second question asks customers about their perceptions of quality. Figure 1.5 reports the quality perceptions of the switchers in each customer base. Both Crest and Colgate buyers perceive both brands to be quality products – as they should, because these are both well researched and well-made products.\n\n**Figure 1.4:** Percentage of brand buyers who say “This is my preferred brand” **Figure 1.5:** Percentage of brand buyers who say “This is a quality product”\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of \"Crest switchers,\" categorizing them based on their agreement or disagreement with a particular statement or proposition. The structure is a simple dichotomy, illustrating the proportion of individuals within this group who fall into each of the two opposing stances. Specifically, 68% of Crest switchers are shown to agree, while the remaining 32% disagree. This highlights a clear majority favoring agreement among this identified consumer segment.\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of Colgate switchers' agreement and disagreement with a particular statement, revealing a clear majority sentiment. Specifically, 43% of Colgate switchers indicated agreement, while a larger proportion, 57%, expressed disagreement. This suggests that the statement in question does not resonate with the majority of consumers who have switched to Colgate.

It indicates that approximately 95% of Crest switchers also switch to Colgate, while around 70% of Colgate switchers switch to Crest. The table further details that 100% of Colgate switchers are accounted for within the Crest switching category, suggesting a strong directional flow from Colgate to Crest. Conversely, the data implies that while a significant portion of Crest users switch to Colgate, the reverse flow is less pronounced, with the provided visual representation for Colgate switchers showing a larger proportion remaining loyal or switching to other brands not explicitly detailed.

      "content": "Consequently, Colgate’s fictional Insights Director is jumping at shadows, and overly worrying Margaret. Colgate’s loyalty metrics, both attitudinal and behavioural, are normal for a brand with half the market share of Crest. Indeed all the other research findings are essentially repeating the findings of the first graph (Figure 1.1), that is, that Colgate is half the size of Crest in this market. These metrics don’t show why it is half the size; they are what they are because of Colgate’s size. All will be explained in the forthcoming chapters (if you can’t wait, turn to the end of the book for a list of laws including those that relate to this Colgate case study)\n\n*Note: this case study could have been written from the Crest (Procter & Gamble) perspective, where the danger would be in patting oneself on the back for having such a ‘strong’ brand with highly loyal buyers. Brand equity consultancies make money flattering owners of large market share brands that they are not just large but also strong with attitudinally committed consumers.*\n\n# Are marketers bleeding the companies that employ them?\n\nI am in awe of the modern market economy and the diversity and quality of products that marketers deliver. This modern economy is the product of one of the most incredible social experiments: in the twentieth century classical, planned economies were tried alongside market economies (Hunt & Morgan 1995). The results were startling. Market economies won by a mile, as they provide people with more choice, fewer queues, and better, cheaper products and services³. For example, within a few hundred metres of where I am sitting I have a choice of multiple grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, cafes, wine stores, even several fine chocolate shops. Not bad!\n\nOnce when I was in Thailand my charming host Professor Tasman Smith asked if we had many Thai restaurants back home in Adelaide, Australia. I did a quick mental count and tactlessly replied, “Yes, there are four within a short walk from our house”. My faux pas illustrates the fact that those who live in developed market economies are spoilt for choice – we can eat pizza in Thailand, or order a curry in Paris, if we want to. This is because today’s marketers do an amazing job of getting attractive goods to market.",

This matters because marketing activities consume a vast amount of our time.\n\nAs Robert Louis Stevenson said, “Everybody lives by selling something”. Poor marketing wastes an incalculable amount of resources, and it prevents and slows the uptake of life-enhancing products and social initiatives.\n\nMarketing practice, for all its advances, has never been strong on R&D into marketing practices; there is plenty of ineffectiveness and room for improvement. Response rates to advertising are perhaps an indicator of inefficiency. However you define a consumer response – from clicking on a web ad to driving to a store – response levels are extremely low, and in some places falling. It’s even more scary if you look at the impact of advertising on memory. For example, one of our yet-to-be-published studies[^4] on advertising productivity examined 143 ads on Australian television that were screened on consecutive weeknight evenings. That weekend respondents were telephoned and those who watched the programs during which the ads were played were asked if they recognised the particular television commercial (i.e. each ad was verbally described to only those people who had an opportunity to see it). The average recognition score for a television ad was barely 40% (i.e. 40% of potential viewers noticed the ad when it aired). Those respondents who recognised the ad were then asked what brand it was for, and on average the correct brand was linked to only approximately 40% of the ads. Consider that for an ad to work, at the very least, it needs to be noticed, processed and be linked to the correct brand. So only around 16% of these advertising exposures passed the two necessary hurdles; put another way, there was 84% wastage^5\n\nNote that the effectiveness of the ads varied widely. Some were noticed by more viewers, and correctly branded too. But most were not. This suggests that there is much to gain from learning how to make better advertising.\n\nKIWI\n\n*Though hard to see, the advertiser here is actually ASB Bank, they are trying to knock a competitor Kiwi Bank (who should be laughing…all the way to the bank)* There is much to learn about marketing.",

Many well-paid marketers are operating with wrong assumptions, so they are making mistakes and wasting money, without even knowing it.\n\nMarketing professionals today are better educated than in the past, and they have access to much more data on buying behaviour. But the study of marketing is so young that we would be arrogant to believe that we know it all, or even that we have got the basics right yet. We can draw an analogy with medical practice. For centuries this noble profession has attracted some of the best and brightest people in society, who were typically far better educated than other professionals. Yet for 2,500 years these experts enthusiastically and universally taught and practised bloodletting (a generally useless and often fatal ‘cure’). Only very recently, about 80 years ago, medical professionals started doing the very opposite, and today blood transfusions save numerous lives each and every day. Marketing managers operate a bit like medieval doctors – working on anecdotal experience, impressions and myth-based explanations.\n\nIt would be arrogant to think that the current marketing ‘best practice’ does not contain many mistakes and erroneous assumptions. I used to teach some erroneous stuff to my university students; I know how easy it is to parrot a falsehood simply because that’s what we were taught to think and because it appears to make sense. This book challenges some of the conventional wisdom with empirical evidence. I hope you find this ‘myth-busting’ knowledge as liberating as it is useful.\n\n# Marketing textbooks\n\nMarketing prides itself on being a practical discipline, so marketing texts (textbooks, marketing magazines, consultant reports, etc.) should be full of answers to practical questions, such as:\n\n* What will happen to sales if I change the price of the product?\n* Why can I see the effect of price promotions in the sales data, but the advertising campaigns barely show up, if at all? Is advertising not generating sales?\n* What is a reasonable cross-selling target?\n* Will the new brand cannibalise sales from the current brand? If so, by * Should I pay double for a full-page newspaper ad or buy the half-page ad instead?\n\n* When should 15-second television ads be used?",

He asked four doctoral students to independently go through nine leading texts looking for managerial principles. They found many (566) normative (‘you should do’) statements, but the texts failed to accompany the statements with supporting empirical evidence. The students only found twenty statements that were clear and meaningful. When these twenty statements were sent to marketing professors they rated only half as true, and said they knew of supporting evidence for only two. Only one single statement was universally rated as true, supported by evidence, as well as being considered managerially useful. But this principle was also rated as “unsurprising, even to someone who had never taken a marketing course”. 6\n\nWe could dismiss our texts as harmless introductions to marketing practice, but marketing texts aren’t harmless, because they routinely lead managers astray. Texts tell us what to worry about (customer satisfaction, image perceptions, brand equity, loyalty), what we should be doing (segmentation, targeting), what techniques to use, and what metrics to measure. Marketing texts largely reflect and reinforce current practice and existing beliefs. They contain a lot of good basic information, like telling us that if we want to advertise we should remember to book the media. But texts are also full of myths; the sort of myths that sap the effectiveness and productivity of marketing departments.\n\nMany of the things that we’ve been told are important, such as loyalty programs, are not (see Chapter 11). Many of the ‘facts’ marketing people believe, particularly about brand buying, are incorrect. Furthermore, many marketers lack the deep knowledge necessary to ask the questions that will lead to new valuable insights.\n\nTake the following test on strategic assumptions (Table 1.1). Marketing professionals agree that these assumptions really matter and underpin strategic marketing decisions that are linked to substantial expenditure. How would you and your marketing colleagues answer these questions? Would there be consensus?\n\nIf your answers were questioned, could you point to anything more than anecdotes to support your view?\n\n**Table 1.1: Strategic assumptions test**",

      "content": "This table presents a series of strategic assumptions related to brand management and marketing, each requiring a True, False, or Don't Know assessment. The assumptions explore core tenets of marketing strategy, including the importance of brand differentiation, the interpretation of loyalty metrics, the cost-effectiveness of customer retention versus acquisition, and the impact of price promotions on penetration versus loyalty. Further assumptions delve into competitive dynamics influenced by brand image positioning, the viability of mass marketing, and the existence of unique customer motivations and buyer personas. Finally, it includes a common heuristic regarding the Pareto principle's application to customer purchasing behavior, specifically the contribution of the heaviest 20% of customers to overall sales. The structure is comparative, posing distinct strategic statements for evaluation.\n\nIf you answer true to most of the questions above then you are operating under false assumptions. This book will give you the evidence. As Mark Twain wrote in his notebook in 1898: “Education consists mainly of what we have unlearned”.\n\n# False assumptions have led us astray in the past\n\n> *“a theory requires some facts, Captain”*  \n> *- Mr Spock, Star Trek episode ‘Space Seed’*\n\nScience’s systematic approach to discovery is a relatively recent practice that didn’t really get going until around the 1700s. Prior to that, knowledge largely came from myth, folk-tale, and from experts in authority (chiefs, priests, kings and queens). How these ‘experts’ acquired their knowledge no-one knew or dared ask. Most of the time their understanding was wrong and there were glaring gaps. This lack of accurate knowledge meant we didn’t think to ask useful questions. So for millions of years humans made little progress; life was typically short, painful and we were hungry and cold much of the time. In the past few hundred years we’ve made extraordinary progress.\n\nOur combined knowledge has grown in leaps and bounds, and we live in comparative luxury.\n\nLet’s return for a moment to the case of our learned but bloodletting doctors. For centuries they bled patients for almost every possible ailment, indeed many advocated bleeding simply to maintain good health. For most of the last millennium bloodletting was as trusted and popular in Europe as aspirin is today (Starr 1998). 7",

      "content": "Over the years, doctors must have killed hundreds of thousands of patients. Among them was US President George Washington, who died when his doctors bled him vigorously to cure a sore throat. The doctor of another US legislator once wrote that he had treated his patient by relieving him of 165 ounces of blood in five days (almost all the blood in his body!). The doctor wrote, ‘he died … had we taken a still greater quantity [of blood] the event might perhaps have been more fortunate’ (Starr, 1998). Apart from a few rare medical conditions, bleeding does no good whatsoever. So how did these well-meaning and well-educated doctors get it so terribly wrong for so long?\n\nFirst, it was because they believed untested theories that advocated bleeding. Like all practitioners they were, probably without realising it, deeply theoretical. The ancient Greeks (e.g. Hippocrates) developed a theory that all illness resulted from an imbalance of humours; bleeding and purging were common ways of addressing such imbalances. This humoural imbalance theory dominated medical thinking in Europe and the Middle East for 2000 years because no one tested if this really was the cause of illness.\n\nSecond, bleeding continued because no-one conducted systematic research into its effects. If patients recovered from their illness then bleeding was credited as the cure; if they died … well they were sick after all! Doctors worked using their impressions, assumptions, commonsense, accepted wisdom, and scattered bits of data. This is very similar to the working practice of marketing managers today.\n\nAdding to the danger, doctors overestimated how much blood was in the human body – no-one checked properly. And they underestimated how long it would take the body to manufacture new blood – again no one checked.\n\nDouglas Starr (1998) argues that bleeding was also popular because it gave doctors a sense of control. It produced dramatic results – patients fainted (for a long while this was considered a good thing). Patients demanded that doctors be seen to do something, and bleeding fulfilled this requirement. It’s not hard to see similarities with many marketing interventions (like price promotions, bursts of advertising, and rushing into ‘new media’ like proverbial lemmings<sup>8</sup>).",

The numbers they recorded started to generate insight into causes and effects, and germ theory eventually triumphed over humoural imbalance theory. Medical experiments gradually started separating the effectual from the ineffectual and the downright dangerous.\n\nToday marketing managers operate a bit like nineteenth century doctors; they are affected by the scientific revolution, but are not yet governed by it. Even ‘best practice’ is still dominated by impressions and untested assumptions. Texts still contain untested, ungrounded theories and myths. And serious experimentation is rare.\n\nThe marketing equivalent of humoural imbalance theory may be the Kotlerian ‘differentiate or die’ world view where marketing success is entirely about creating superior products, selling these at a premium price, targeting the most likely buyers, and advertising to bring people’s minds around to the product’s superiority.\n\nYou are reading a book about real-world facts and law-like relationships that challenge the fundamental tenets of modern marketing theory; the widespread beliefs that affect not just the decisions of marketing managers, but also how marketers see the world.\n\n# Commonplace marketing mistakes\n\nEven the most intelligent marketers, in the best organisations, routinely make mistakes. Because many marketers operate using incorrect assumptions about how buyers buy and how marketing works, they emphasise the wrong things and ignore important points, consequently making mistakes such as:\n\n* changing packaging in ways that reduce the brand’s ability to be noticed\n* creating advertising that doesn’t build or refresh relevant memory structures\n* failing to research what memory structures are devoted to the brand\n* failing to research what makes the brand distinctive and noticeable\n* creating advertising that isn’t branded (other than a flash of the brand name) * investing countless hours and many dollars on pointless tracking research that informs no decisions\n\n* over-investing in already highly loyal consumers, while neglecting to reach new buyers  \n* pricing too high then trying to compensate with very regular price discounts  \n* teaching consumers to buy when the brand is discounted  \n* burning media dollars in advertising bursts then going silent for long periods (when consumers are still buying)  \n* paying premiums for low-reach ‘niche’ media.\n\nIt’s not that there is anything wrong with the intelligence of marketers, but like all professionals they need some empirically grounded guidance.\n\n# Law-like reoccurring patterns",

These are findings that have a long use-by date because they have been found to hold for long periods of time, across all sorts of conditions (including across product and service categories, and countries). This research is also very different from most academic research, where each study is typically based on one single set of data, collected in one particular set of conditions, and so tells us almost nothing about the generalisability of the finding (where it holds and where it does not). 9\n\nUncovering patterns that generalise is the fundamental work of science. It is only because we know that these scientific laws hold across a wide range of conditions that they can be used for prediction. And by knowing the many factors that do not affect the laws, and maybe the few that do, we gain deep explanatory insight into why things are the way they are, and how things work.  \nThis is how science works.\n\n# Where do these discoveries come from?\n\nThis book draws largely from the work of researchers at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science. The early discoveries come from work started by Professor Andrew Ehrenberg and Professor Gerald Goodhardt five decades ago.\n\nToday this fundamental research continues at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute at the University of South Australia. There are also plenty of like-minded researchers working inside and outside universities around the world. These efforts receive encouragement and financial support from progressive corporations around the world including Turner Broadcasting, Mars, Colgate, Kraft, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, CBS, ESPN, Mountainview Learning and many others. We are very grateful for this ongoing support.\n\nMany of the findings in this book are emotionally confronting, because they clash with conventional wisdom. In order to make readers feel more psychologically comfortable with this ‘myth busting’ I have attempted to give a good feel for the empirical data[^10] and how the analysis was done. I’ve done this by completely avoiding complicated obscuring statistics and algebra; there are no ‘black box’ (or ‘trust me’) techniques used, and references are supplied so that interested readers can delve further.",

      "content": "## Which Customers Matter Most?\n\nByron Sharp\n\n----\n\n> *The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas,*  \n> *but in escaping the old ones.*  \n> John Maynard Keynes (quoted in Drexler, 1987)\n\nSmart marketers know they need to reach all buyers (i.e. buyers of the category, and everyone from light to heavy buyers of a brand) in order to reinforce buying propensities, and to win new sales.\n\n## The death of mass marketing?\n\nThis table outlines two distinct marketing strategies: Mass Marketing and Target Marketing. Mass Marketing adopts a broad approach, aiming to sell to all buyers within a product category, characterized by a large number of occasional purchasers and a tolerance for weak customer loyalty and relationships. In contrast, Target Marketing employs a more focused approach, deliberately excluding some category buyers to concentrate efforts on specific groups. These targeted groups can be either those who purchase the brand more frequently (heavier buyers) or a clearly defined segment of individuals with shared characteristics. The core difference lies in the scope of the customer base and the emphasis placed on building relationships versus maximizing reach.\n\nProfessor Phil Kotler and colleagues (1998), amongst others, have declared mass marketing to be old fashioned. ‘Modern’ marketing is said to be about positioning; targeting segments; focusing on loyal, heavier buyers; focusing on retention (not acquisition) and return on investment (ROI). Oddly, textbooks have been preaching this ‘new’ message for decades. Today’s fashionable media strategy uses new, diverse, low-reach media to deliver new ‘consumer engagement’ (see Nelson-Field et al 2012). Broad-reaching television channels and newspapers – while still very much used by marketers (to great effect) – are no longer de rigueur. Today the fashion is for loyalty programs, websites for loyalists (e.g. Budweiser’s (ill-fated) ‘Bud.tv’), targeting ‘influencers’, customer relationship management (CRM) and ‘new media’.\n\nYet buyers are busier than ever, and many brands are vying for their attention and custom. Forming deep relationships with a substantial number of buyers seems more unlikely than ever. Consequently, it is logical to expect marketers to strive to become better at mass marketing, rather than abandoning it. This is supported by researchers who have been studying patterns in buyer behaviour and brand performance; they have concluded that mass marketing is essential for both brand maintenance and growth.",

      "content": "For decades marketing scientists have been studying buying rates and the statistical distribution of these rates. Buying rates show how many people buy a brand once a year, how many buy it twice, three times and so on. These patterns in these buying rates are rarely taught at business schools but they are used everyday in businesses. These law-like patterns underpin successful sales-forecasting techniques that are used by leaders in this field like BASES, as well as being integrated into some media scheduling models.\n\nToday we know a lot about how often people buy, and how much variation there is between people’s buying. We know that buyers differ from one another in terms of how often they buy and the different brands they buy. We also know how many of each type (weight) of buyer there are. These data provide benchmarks, allow for very useful predictions and deliver great insights. This is a tremendous scientific achievement, and something all marketers should be familiar with.\n\n# Light buyers matter\n\nAll brands have many lighter buyers. While these people are only occasional buyers of a brand, there are so many of them that they collectively contribute substantially to sales volume.\n\nIt is surprising just how light the typical buyer is. Let’s look at a super big brand in a frequently bought category: Coca-Cola (see Figure 4.1). In many markets, Coke is the market leader by far in the cola category. Data from the Kantar Impulse Panel in the UK (this panel tracks personal purchases, for example, a person buying a can of Coke to drink themself) shows that the average Coca-Cola buyer purchases almost 12 times a year, around once a month. But this average is very misleading, because purchase frequencies show a skewed distribution. The average buyer is not typical. There are some people who buy Coca-Cola morning, noon and night – that’s more than 1000 purchases every year.\n\nSo for Coca-Cola to have an average buying rate of just 12, each of these super heavy buyers must be balanced by many hundreds of Coke buyers who buy only a few times a year.",

      "content": "The Kantar Impulse Panel data shows that a typical Coca-Cola buyer purchases (for him- or herself) just one or two cans or bottles a year. That’s half of all Coke buyers. Only a tiny fraction of Coke buyers purchase around the average amount of 12 purchases. Therefore, the average buyer is certainly not typical.\n\nAround 30% of cola buyers don’t even buy themselves a single Coca-Cola each year. Note that these are people who do buy cola (not just soft drink) – so most of these people do indeed buy Coca-Cola, just very occasionally and not every year!\n\nTherefore, from Coca-Cola’s perspective, a heavy buyer is anyone who buys three or more cans or bottles of Coke a year. Many of us who thought we hardly every bought Coke now turn out to be quite normal Coke buyers. Very light buyers dominate, even for Coca-Cola – which is a very large brand indeed.\n\n**Figure 4.1:** Distribution of buying rates of UK cola buyers purchasing Regular Coca-Cola **Source: Kantar Worldpanel, UK 2005.**\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of cola buyer purchasing frequency, specifically for Coca-Cola, detailing the percentage of buyers who purchase at a given frequency per year. The structure is a direct mapping of purchase instances to buyer proportions. It shows that a significant portion of buyers, 32%, purchase Coca-Cola once per year, with decreasing percentages for higher purchase frequencies. Notably, 18% buy twice annually, and 10% buy three times. As the frequency increases, the percentage of buyers diminishes, with 7% buying four times and 4% buying five times. Frequencies beyond five purchases show progressively smaller buyer segments, with 1% buying ten times and a cumulative less than 0.5% buying between 13 and 52 times per year, indicating a concentration of purchasing behavior at lower frequencies.\n\n> If you buy yourself a Coca-cola more than 3 times a year then you are one of Coke’s heavy buyers!\n\nWhat do the buying frequencies look like for smaller brands? They are surprisingly similar. Let’s look at Pepsi, which is a considerably smaller brand in this market (see Figure 4.2).",

There are many more cola buyers who don’t buy Pepsi in a year – more than 50%, compared to the 30% who didn’t buy Coke that year. This is because Pepsi is a smaller brand. But again, a heavy buyer for Pepsi is anyone who buys more than three times a year.\n\n**Figure 4.2:** Percentage of UK cola buyers purchasing Pepsi x times, 2005 **Source: Kantar Worldpanel.**\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of Pepsi purchase frequency and its correlation with the percentage of cola buyers. Initially, when Pepsi is bought 0 times, 50% of cola buyers purchase it. As the number of times Pepsi is bought increases, the percentage of cola buyers purchasing Pepsi shows a sharp decline. For instance, at 1 purchase, this figure drops to 12%, and further decreases to 8% at 2 purchases, and 5% at 3 purchases. This downward trend continues, with the percentage of cola buyers steadily decreasing as purchase frequency rises. By 10 purchases, the percentage is 0.5%, and it reaches 0.1% by 16 purchases. Beyond 20 purchases, the percentage stabilizes at a low of 0.05%, remaining constant up to 52 purchases, indicating a diminishing impact of higher purchase frequencies on the overall proportion of cola buyers.\n\n> **If you buy yourself a Pepsi more than 3 times a year then you are one of Pepsi’s heavy buyers!**\n\nIs the UK cola market strange? What does the US look like? Figure 4.3 shows the purchasing pattern (this time at household level) of Coke and Pepsi in the US in 2012. The UK and US buying patterns are astonishingly similar because this pattern generalises around the world, over time, across product categories, and for all the different market research providers. This pattern is nothing to do with soft-drink, it concerns all markets.\n\nThis time the population base is all shoppers not just cola buyers so the penetrations are lower (more zero buyers). Clearly both of these large brands have plenty of room to recruit consumers.\n\n**Figure 4.3:** Percentage of US households purchasing Coke & Pepsi x times, 2012 **Source: Nielsen 2012.**",

      "content": "This data presents a comparative analysis of Coke and Pepsi sales in 2012, visualized as a stacked bar chart. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 20, representing units or categories, while the y-axis displays values from 0 to 80 in increments of 10. The chart structure indicates that Coke occupies the majority of the sales volume, represented by a red bar extending across almost the entire width of the chart. Pepsi's sales are depicted by a blue bar, positioned at the beginning of the x-axis and occupying a significantly smaller portion compared to Coke. This visual representation highlights Coke's dominant market share over Pepsi within the observed period.\n\nSo brands have many light buyers who buy the brand very occasionally. They buy the brand infrequently because they don’t buy from the category very often, and they buy a number of different brands. For example, it’s very common for a high-volume, packaged goods category to be bought on average less than 10 times a year by buyers.[21] Brands in such categories are only bought by their consumers three or four times a year on average. For such a brand their most typical buyers buy them barely more than once a year.\n\nMarketers easily forget how rarely their buyers buy their brand. They are often surprised how low their average purchase frequency metric is (and they mistakenly conclude that this means there is plenty of scope to easily increase this metric). Few appreciate that this average is still much heavier than their typical buyer – and that the calculation of the average doesn’t include all those who happened to not purchase the brand at all during the period. The great mass of typical buyers only very occasionally buy a brand.\n\nThis shows up in services markets too, where a large proportion of customers buy most of their purchases from another brand. For example, in personal banking, almost half a bank’s customers will list another bank as their main financial institution.\n\nAt the other end of the buying spectrum there are a few buyers who buy a category often – and a few of these buy a category very often. These buyers are important because they deliver a lot of sales volume in spite of their small numbers.",

      "content": "For example, the 4% or so of Coca-Cola’s buyers who purchased Coke once a week or more (52+ times that year) delivered a bit more than 20% of its sales volume that year.\n\nFortunately, these ultra-heavy buyers are comparatively easy to market to, because the category and the brand are, comparatively speaking, much more important to them than to the typical buyer. These heavy buyers get many opportunities to see point-of-sale material and packaging changes (and they are presumably very good at learning about regular promotions). These buyers are also far more receptive to the brand’s advertising: they notice it more and they find it easier to process and remember.\n\nAt the very extreme, the buyer who drinks Coca-Cola morning, noon, and night has a very well ingrained habit. They are locked in their ways and may even be a little bit addicted to the product category[^22]. One could argue there is little need to market to these buyers at all, especially considering that they are comparatively non-responsive to advertising (i.e. their behaviour tends not to change in response to advertising; their buying neither increases nor decreases). They will keep buying in large volumes until one day something momentous happens and they downgrade, or drop the brand, or quit the category (or die), all of which is usually out of your control.\n\nAt the other end of the buying spectrum are the typical, very infrequent buyers. These people – who are most of your consumers – are a marketing challenge because it is hard to justify spending money on them individually (direct mail is usually out of the question). And yet collectively they are important for sales volume and offer great potential for growth. An implication of the skewed distribution of buying rates is that to maintain sales a brand needs to reach out to these masses of buyers. For two reasons:\n\n1. there are so many of them  \n2. they buy so infrequently and could easily forget about you.\n\n# Pareto’s law (but not as you know it)\n\nYou may be wondering if this distribution of buying frequencies has something to do with marketing’s best-known law: 80% of sales come from the heaviest 20% of brand buyers. Yes it does, it underpins Pareto’s ‘80/20’ law. However, it is important to know that the ‘80/20 law’ is a misleading simplification. The ratio is rarely as extreme as 80/20.",

      "content": "The share of purchases undertaken by the heaviest 20% of a brand’s buyers (the ‘Pareto share’) reflects the polarisation in buying rates between the heaviest and lightest buyers.\n\nIn our Coca-Cola example, there are plenty of cola buyers who buy themselves a Coca-Cola only a few times a year, and a smaller group who buy much more regularly (once a week or daily or more). This results in a very typical Pareto share (closer to 50% than 80%).\n\nIn contrast, there are categories where buyers are more homogeneous. For example, most people fill their car with petrol once a week. There is a tiny group of people who don’t own a car, yet who occasionally buy fuel when they hire a car – but only a few of these people show up in a period of analysis. There are some other people who drive a lot, and fill up twice, maybe three times a week. But the vast majority of people buy petrol once a week (and even the heavy buyers don’t buy significantly more than this), so buying rates aren’t polarised and the Pareto share is not very extreme.\n\nThe Pareto share metric depends on the time period of study (Schmittlein, Cooper & Morrison 1993). In a very short time period all the people who have bought the brand will have bought at a very similar rate; for example, in a week almost everyone who has bought has done so just once, perhaps a few have bought twice, in which case the heaviest 20% of buyers will be responsible for about 20% of sales (say 25/20). As time goes by the heaviest buyers reveal their true colours and show how much more frequently they buy the brand. Also, larger numbers of very light buyers enter the analysis window by buying the brand just once. This increases the polarisation between heavy and light buyers – giving a more extreme Pareto share metric.\n\nOur research (Sharp & Romaniuk 2007) of many dozens of brands, across product categories, shows that over a three-month period a ‘fast-moving consumer good’ brand will typically have a Pareto share of only 35%. Over a year this metric will have risen to over 50%, usually not far over 50% and rarely anything like the proverbial 80%.",

Ignoring light and non-buyers of a brand is no recipe for growth (as we saw in the Chapters 2 and 3). Besides the logic is flawed, what matters is not so much the weight of a buyer as their propensity to change in reaction to marketing.

      "content": "The logic of targeting heavy buyers is undermined further by the fact that the *future* sales potential of individuals is different than their current buying suggests. This is true even when you have perfectly reliable sales data on your individual buyers, and even when there is no real change in their behaviour. Non-buyers and light buyers are heavier buyers than you think, and heavy buyers are lighter. This is neatly illustrated in a two-year analysis of a leading brand of tomato sauce in the US using IRI and Nielsen panel data (Anschuetz 2002). Although the brand was stationary (not growing or losing sales volume), 14% of its sales came from households that did not buy it at all in the year before; in other words, from people who the brand’s marketing team would have considered were non-buyers of the brand. While the small group (9%) of heavy buying households delivered 34% of volume, this was less than the 43% they delivered in Year 1. Table 4.4 shows that over time the heavier buyers get lighter, and the non-buyers and light buyers get heavier.\n\nThe way the lightest buyers became heavier and the heaviest buyers became lighter is a ‘regression to the mean’ phenomenon. This law (which we’ll call ‘the law of buyer moderation’)<sup>24</sup> applies to all brands and can be precisely predicted from the known distribution of buying frequencies.\n\n**Table 4.4:** Sales volumes from different buyer groups one year later\n\nThis data presents a breakdown of buyer groups based on their purchasing frequency and representation of brand sales volume over two years. The sample is categorized into Non-buyers, Light buyers, Moderate buyers, and Heavy buyers, with percentages of the total sample indicated for each. Buying frequency is measured in years, ranging from zero for Non-buyers to five or more for Heavy buyers. The table further illustrates the proportion of total brand sales volume attributed to each buyer group in Year 1 and Year 2. Notably, Non-buyers represent 0% of sales volume in Year 1 but 14% in Year 2, while Light, Moderate, and Heavy buyers collectively account for the remaining sales volume, showing shifts in their contributions between the two years. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences across buyer segments and changes over time. **Source: Anschuetz, 2002; US IRI panel data.**",

      "content": "In fact, few of these buyers are actually changing, which can seem rather mysterious, and is widely misunderstood. Most people don’t know about the law of buyer moderation. This law undermines marketers’ strategies to target heavy buyers of a brand and ignore light buyers (and the great deal of sales potential that they offer).\n\nThe law of buyer moderation occurs because of variation in the timing of individuals’ purchasing. Some years buyers purchase the brand once, other years they buy it twice as much – this isn’t real change; there is simply a (predictable) degree of wobble even around a stable ongoing buying rate. This wobble means that some of the households that were called ‘non-buyers of the brand’ weren’t really – they just hadn’t bought in the particular base year and so were misclassified as non-buyers. Just as some buyers were misclassified as light buyers when they really were heavier. Other customers were misclassified as heavy buyers because they bought the brand a bit more often than usual in the year the analyst chose to classify them (perhaps relatives came to visit so one year they had to buy extra). This phenomenon is much worse over short periods (a month or a quarter) than over a year, though it still occurs in annual data, and even for a big brand, as Table 4.4 above shows.\n\nRemember people wobble/vary in both the amount they buy from the category and how they distribute their buying within their repertoire – due to thousands of things like the weather, getting caught in traffic, having a party to go to, having someone to stay, taking a different path through the supermarket and so on. It’s easy for a person to go from buying a brand twice in one year to four times in the next, and the other way round, *without any change in that person’s loyalties* (see Sharp et al 2012). For many brands random wobble like this can move a consumer from being a light buyer (bottom 80%) to being a heavy buyer (top 20%) because most buyers buy less than twice a year – see Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3.\n\nSo we have three key facts about marketing’s Pareto law:",

Put simply, next period your heaviest 20% of customers won’t be so heavy, the light buyers will be heavier, and some of the non-buyers will buy.\n\nThis is the law of buyer moderation.\n\nHowever, there is another law-like pattern that, in Professor Andrew Ehrenberg’s (2004) words, “should have been the end of the marketing pipedream of just recruiting heavy-buying buyers”. Let’s look at what happens to a brand’s distribution of buying rates when the brand grows its market share.\n\n# Changes occur across heavy and light segments\n\nLook again at Figures 4.1 and 4.2, which show the buying frequencies of Coke and Pepsi buyers.\n\nThe shapes of the distributions are very similar – going from Coke to Pepsi it looks as if the frequencies have simply slid to the left (i.e. everyone buying a little less frequently). In fact, both these distributions have the same mathematical properties; this type of distribution is called a negative binomial distribution (NBD). NBD seems to describe the purchase frequencies of all brands, and has done so for decades (it was discovered in 1959 by Andrew Ehrenberg). The NBD is typically a very skewed distribution (i.e. there are many more buyers who are lighter than the average buyer). Hence, there is a 60/20 Pareto concentration of sales volume.",

      "content": "This large proportion of very light buyers shows up in brand performance metrics (as we saw in Chapters 2 and 3). Remember that brands with larger market share typically have substantially higher penetration figures than smaller brands (the double jeopardy law). But in contrast, the purchase frequency scores of the larger brands (how often their buyers buy their brand) are only marginally higher. And when brands grow or decline there is a lot of change in their category penetration (the size of their buyer base) and little change in their purchase frequency. Now we can see the reason why the penetration metric shows so much change. It’s due to the NBD’s skewed distribution of buying rates. When a brand grows it recruits a lot of light buyers who become heavy enough to buy at least once during the period of analysis; so now they show up in the penetration metric. Some heavier buyers also buy a bit more frequently, but remember there aren’t many of these people so overall the average rate of buying doesn’t change much (see how little the mean average differs in the Coke and Pepsi charts). Therefore, the NBD explains the double jeopardy law.\n\nOne of the great insights is that all brands, irrespective of their size, face an NBD of heavy to light buyers. When brands grow, or decline in market share, they simply move from one weight of this distribution to another.\n\nPut another way, changes in sales come from buying propensities changing across the entire market – from heavy to light and non-buyers of the brand. Every buyer group (or weight) changes<sup>25</sup>. When marketing is successful in delivering more sales and market share, it does so by giving the brand more heavy buyers, more medium buyers and a lot more light buyers. This means that for maintenance or growth, a brand’s marketing has to somehow, at least over time, reach all the buyers in a category.",

For example, Figure 4.4 shows the distribution of buying for the toothpaste category - one where we would hope there was rather regular buying. Yet is seems rather rare for a UK household to buy toothpaste more than six times a year. Most bought three times or less, indeed 11% did not buy toothpaste that year.\n\n**Figure 4.4:** Toothpaste category buying distribution\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of buyer distribution based on the number of purchases made. The structure is a direct mapping, showing the percentage of buyers corresponding to each purchase quantity. A significant portion of buyers, 11%, made zero purchases, while 18% made a single purchase, representing the largest individual segments. As the number of purchases increases, the percentage of buyers generally decreases, with a notable drop after the first purchase. For instance, 14% of buyers made two purchases, and this figure steadily declines to 1% for buyers making between 12 and 15 purchases. The data indicates a sharp decrease in buyer participation beyond a certain threshold, with very few buyers making a high volume of purchases, and a small fraction (1%) making 20 or more purchases.\n\n*Source: data kindly provided by Kantar, UK, 2007.*\n\nOf course, for an individual toothpaste brand these figures are even lighter, less frequent, because a brand’s uses also buy other brands. See Figure 4.5 which shows the buying distribution for Colgate in the same market in the same year. Now 86% of shoppers bought three times or less, with 59% not buying Colgate that year.\n\n**Figure 4.5:** Colgate buyer distribution *Source: data kindly provided by Kantar, UK, 2007.*",

      "content": "Therefore, marketing that seeks to increase sales by targeting heavier buyers is unlikely to succeed. Loyalty programs are a classic example of a strategy skewed towards heavier buyers of a brand. These programs are still very popular with marketers; and yet with thousands of such programs running it is difficult to find even a few claiming great success. The serious academic studies report the same finding: loyalty programs generate small or no shifts in market share (see Chapter 11). Price promotions, in contrast, do increase sales, but they are also skewed towards heavier buyers. In spite of a lot of volume being sold on deal, promotions stimulate far less incremental volume (see Chapter 10). Many of the sales would have occurred anyway, to customers who already buy the brand regularly. When the price promotion ends, sales instantly collapse back to their normal level. This is a good example of how difficult it is to bring about sustained growth by targeting only heavy buyers.\n\nIf this weren’t the case, then we would routinely see brands that had different buying distributions, and unusually high loyalty metrics for their market share levels. But we don’t.\n\nConversely, marketing that targets light buyers of the brand, and/or non-buyers, has far greater chance of success. This is because such marketing has great reach. Most of a brand’s buyers are light buyers, and because it’s nearly impossible to simply target light buyers, heavy buyers tend to get hit too. And heavy buyers are far more likely to notice advertising, visit stores and notice publicity.\n\nA classic example of brand growth is due to winning distribution in a new geographical area. This reaches buyers who, because it was inconvenient for them, were previously light buyers (or even real non-buyers) of the brand. These previously light/non-buyers start buying the brand and its penetration metric jumps up. The new store also improves the availability of the brand for existing heavier buyers, when they happen to be in the neighbourhood. So over time they also buy a little more often. This helps nudge up average purchase frequency (and other loyalty metrics). This large rise in penetration and small gain in loyalty fits the double jeopardy pattern we saw in brand performance metrics in Chapter 2.\n\n# Conclusion",

So, target the whole market – all sorts of different people.\n\n## Who are our buyers? Who are our potential customers?\n\nCommon marketing ideology states that differentiated brands should sell to different groups of people, or should sell for different occasions or uses. In which case, an important question for brand managers is, “What sort of people buy my brand?” The answer to this question provides insight into how to market a brand. It also allows for a brand’s current sales potential to be estimated: if a brand sells to a unique customer base it can’t sell to everyone and its growth potential has clear boundaries.\n\nIn 1959 a business school professor at the University of Hawaii gave personality tests to people who owned Ford and Chevrolet cars (see Evans 1959). This sounds like an odd thing to do, but the theory was that Americans in the 1950s took their cars very seriously, cars were deeply symbolic purchases, and marketers had invested in building distinctive brand images. It was expected this would show up in interesting ways in the personality profiles of the respective customer bases. Executives from car companies and academics had expressed this belief.\n\nThe results were indeed interesting. The personality and demographic profiles of Ford and Chevrolet owners were essentially identical. The lack of difference shocked the marketing world. At first people argued about the results. Then the finding was repeatedly confirmed with different samples, techniques and product categories. After that everyone decided to ignore the discovery. As Winston Churchill said, “Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, but usually manages to pick himself up, walk over or around it, and carry on.” (Klotz 1996).",

      "content": "Nearly 50 years later a series of vastly more comprehensive studies were undertaken examining the profiles of the customer bases of competing brands. These studies profiled hundreds of brands, across dozens of categories (from cigarettes to computer games to mortgages) over time (Hammond, Ehrenberg & Goodhardt 1996; Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Kennedy, Ehrenberg & Long 2000, Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2001a; Kennedy & Ehrenberg, 2001b). Just as importantly, the studies used hundreds of variables capable of describing buyers: demographics, psychographics, attitudes, values and media habits. The key discovery of these studies is that competing brands sell to the same sort of people. Within each brand’s customer base there is a lot of variation (i.e. different types of people), but each brand has the same variation.\n\nTable 5.1 presents car ownership data from a different decade (1990s), but still the same pattern is clear. The customer bases of these UK car brands are quite similar to each other – even in the newspapers they read. Rover buyers, in spite of driving an up-market brand, still read the tabloid newspaper, the Sun, far more than they read the more intellectual newspaper, the Telegraph. This is also true for the owners of all the other car brands, and reflects the fact that the Sun is considerably more popular than the Telegraph. The greatest difference in the customer base is household size. This reflects the fact that larger households buy brands of cars that are physically bigger (more seats with a larger boot). Sierra and Cavalier are somewhat physically larger vehicles.\n\n**Table 5.1:** Car brands sell to similar types of people, UK 1990s\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of owners across five car models: Rover, Escort, Sierra, and Cavalier, alongside an overall average. The comparison focuses on demographic and media consumption characteristics. For each car model and the average, the data details the gender distribution of owners, showing a slight male majority across the board. Household size is also broken down, distinguishing between smaller (1-2 people) and larger (2+ people) households, with a general trend towards smaller households, though the average indicates a near-even split. Finally, the data quantifies the percentage of owners who read specific newspapers, the \"Sun\" and the \"Telegraph,\" revealing a significantly higher readership of the \"Sun\" compared to the \"Telegraph\" across all car models and the average.\n\n*Source: TGI.*",

The percentages indicate the proportion of owners of specific car models (Rover, Escort, Sierra, Cavalier) who agree with each statement. Across all surveyed car models, there is a general trend: a higher percentage of owners express agreement with the idea that \"A car is only to get from A to B\" and \"I cannot bear untidiness,\" with averages of 18% for both. Conversely, fewer owners agree with \"I keep up with technology\" (average 10%) and \"I judge people by the car they drive\" (average 2%).

An overall \"Average\" row synthesizes the data, indicating a general trend of male dominance in beer purchasing, a significant proportion of younger (<29) buyers, and a substantial segment of buyers earning below $50,000 annually.

Barclays MasterCard has a customer base that is 60% male compared to the average of 54%, but this is a small difference that has no practical marketing significance.\n\nNo sensible marketer would alter their marketing strategy based on this data. Also, around 40% of every brand’s customer base is aged between 35 and 54 years old; this percentage is 47% for Access NatWest – but again, this is a small difference that has no practical significance.\n\n**Table 5.4:** Demographic profiles of credit card brands, UK\n\nThis table presents a comparative analysis of credit card ownership demographics, broken down by gender and age groups across various credit card brands. The data is structured to show the percentage distribution of cardholders for each brand, with a specific focus on the male-to-female ratio and the age distribution across ten categories: 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. A consolidated \"Average brand\" row provides an aggregated view of these demographic percentages. The overall structure is comparative, allowing for direct observation of how different credit card brands align with specific gender and age segments of the consumer base.\n\n*Source: TGI.*\n\nThese sorts of minor difference – some simply due to random sampling variation – were the norm in all the research studies. This is illustrated in Table 5.5, which shows the average size of the average deviation from the brand norm in more than 40 product/service categories summarised by Dr Rachel Kennedy (see Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000).\n\n**Table 5.5:** Deviation from the brand norm",

The structure is a simple enumeration of product categories, each assigned numerical values for these metrics. The categories are diverse, ranging from everyday consumables like \"Cigarettes\" and \"Cat food\" to services such as \"Private health insurance\" and \"Package holidays,\" and even durable goods like \"Computers\" and \"Cars.\" The values assigned appear to represent some form of rating or frequency, with higher numbers indicating a greater presence or significance within each metric. The \"Average\" column aggregates these scores, providing a consolidated measure for each category. Notably, \"Cigarettes\" stands out with the highest scores across all metrics and the overall average, while categories like \"Airlines,\" \"Camera film,\" and \"Cars\" consistently receive lower scores. The table concludes with an overall average across all categories for each metric, serving as a benchmark. **Source: Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Data courtesy of TGI.**\n\nThe categories are ranked by size of the deviation, but as you can see there isn’t great variation between them. In each of these categories the typical deviation is small, apart from some rather obvious differences, such as:\n\n* Scottish newspapers have more readers in Scotland than the average newspaper brand.\n* Children’s television channels have more children viewers than the average television channel (though still almost half the viewers of these channels are adults).\n* Very expensive brands have fewer poor people in their customer base.\n\nLarge exceptions are worthy of management attention, but of course they are undoubtedly well known (e.g. that’s why we use names like ‘children’s channels’).\n\n# Extreme targeting\n\nMaybe the real-world looks like this because marketers haven’t targeted special audiences. Maybe if they tried harder reality might match textbook theory? But the two following case studies suggest that even when marketers try, in very overt ways, to target special audiences, they end up with normal-looking customer bases (so long as they are successful in winning market share). By definition, the more market share they gain, the more normal their customer base becomes.[^26]\n\n# No girls Nestle YORKIE IT'S NOT FOR GIRLS!\n\npackaging front and back",

This packaging looks like a serious attempt to gain a segmented customer base: men.\n\nOf course, this is cheeky British humour, designed to get the brand, and its television advertising, noticed. <sup>27</sup> However, decades before Nestle adopted this slogan, Yorkie ads consistently stressed the large chunks of chocolate<sup>28</sup> and very much targeted blue-collar, male workers. Most of the original advertising featured truck drivers enjoying Yorkie bars<sup>29</sup>. After a long gap, or a period of unmemorable advertising, the “It’s not for girls!” campaign was launched – perhaps as a return to the brand’s historic roots. As one commentator noted, “From the ads they seem to be targeting not ‘British men’ but British, large, bearded, macho, builders. That’s got to be a limited market …” (Redfern, 2002). But either the market got the joke or the targeting failed because this is what the user base of Yorkie looks like today:\n\n**Table 5.6:** Percentage of Yorkie bar buyers: male versus female over different product variants\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of brand preferences between males and females, focusing on three specific Yorkie chocolate bar varieties.

For each gender, the table quantifies the total brand engagement and the specific engagement with 'Yorkie - Milk', 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit', and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. The data reveals differing preferences, with males showing higher engagement in total brand and 'Yorkie - Milk', while females exhibit a stronger preference for 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit' and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. This highlights a gender-based divergence in the consumption patterns of these particular chocolate products.\n\n*Source: Kantar Worldpanel.* And now a more serious example…",

But one financial institution said, “Our brand is different”, and they seemed to have a case. This Australian credit card gives a small donation to a local maternity hospital for every dollar that users spend on the card. It even features a picture of a baby on the card itself.\n\nIt is obvious that this card would have a customer base skewed towards women. Not just because the card would appeal to women but also because it wouldn’t appeal to groups like young men (and maybe even young women). The marketing department told us this must be the case. But then the data came in (see Table 5.7). Cardholders are ever slightly more likely to be female than non-cardholders; but they are also more likely to be single and no more likely to have children. It appears that you don’t have to be a mother to value this credit card.\n\n**Table 5.7: Cardholds c.f. non-cardholders**\n\nThis table presents a demographic breakdown of a population, categorizing individuals by gender and household composition. The primary division is between males and females, each represented as a percentage of the total. Further segmentation occurs within these gender groups based on their relationship status and family structure. These categories include singles, couples without children, families with children, and an 'other' classification for individuals not fitting the preceding descriptions. The data structure allows for a comparative analysis of how different household types are distributed across genders, offering insights into family structures and relationship statuses within the surveyed population.

The structure is a matrix where each row represents a credit card brand, and each column represents a specific attitude, with numerical values indicating the degree of agreement or disagreement. Key relationships are shown through the varying scores for each brand across attitudes like \"Children should express themselves freely,\" \"I am happy with my standard of living,\" \"I can’t bear untidiness,\" \"I try to keep up with technology,\" and \"I always look for special offers.\" For instance, \"Access Lloyds\" shows consistent positive scores across most attitudes, suggesting a strong alignment, while \"TSB Trust card\" exhibits a wider range of scores, indicating more varied attitudinal profiles. The overarching structure is comparative, allowing for direct observation of how different credit card brands are perceived or associated with distinct consumer attitudes.\n\n*Adapted from Kennedy and Ehrenberg (2000), “Brand user profiles seldom differ,” Report 7 for Corporate Members: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science.*\n\nThere is one obvious way that buyers of one brand vary from another: their brand buying. This affects their attitude to brands and their brand knowledge. People tend to have opinions about the brands they buy, and not think or know much about brands they don’t use. Behaviour is a powerful driver of awareness, perceptions and attitudes – something that both academic and market researchers have a tendency to forget.<sup>30</sup>\n\nAttitudes reflect how much a buyer buys the brand, that is, they reflect loyalty. We know that loyalty metrics don’t vary a lot between brands. Consequently, the buyers of brand A have the same opinion of brand A as buyers of brand B have of brand B. I call this the ‘my mum’ phenomenon: my own mother is the best mum in the world, she’s lovely, but she can also be rather annoying sometimes. Does that sound like your mum?\n\nAnother lovely example of this was a global survey of tourists conducted by the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.\n\nThe survey asked the tourists to describe why they chose their last holiday destination. The open-ended, qualitative responses were collated for each destination; unexpectedly, the researchers noticed a high degree of similarity in the responses for each destination, for example:\n\n* somewhere new and exciting  \n* interesting people and culture  \n* nice shopping  \n* somewhere to relax.",

But aside from these descriptive differences, the tourists’ stated motivations and benefits were uncannily similar. This is another way that a brand’s customer base is similar to that of other brands.\n\n# Different variants\n\nBrand managers often add variants – also known as stock-keeping units (SKU) – to their brand in the belief that this allows the brand to reach different buyers. Let’s look at variants. They are interesting because their clear functional differences could mean they are used by different people.\n\nTable 5.9 shows the normal market shares for regular (63% share) and diet/no sugar (35% share) soft drinks, and then their market shares in particular demographic groups. This sort of analysis, popular in market research reports (where indices are often used) can exaggerate differences in that it is possible to have an unusually high share, but in a tiny demographic group, so that your overall customer base isn’t much different. I’ve deliberately chosen this style of analysis to show even tiny potential differences, but as you can see there isn’t much to show. Read the table downwards for each variant. Regular soft drink has an overall share of about two-thirds – it also has this share in each demographic. Diet soft drink has a share of about one-third, both overall and also in each demographic sub-group. So neither variant appeals especially to any particular segment (and that’s in spite of years of diet soft drink advertising trying to target women).<sup>31</sup>\n\n**Table 5.9:** Gender profile of different types of soft drink\n\nThis table presents a comparative analysis of market share for regular and diet soft drinks within a specific demographic group. It aims to illustrate the relative popularity and consumer preference between these two product categories. The structure is straightforward, with distinct columns for each soft drink type and rows (implicitly, though not detailed in the provided snippet) that would represent different demographic segments or time periods. The core comparison lies in the percentage of market share held by regular versus diet soft drinks, allowing for an assessment of which product type is more dominant or preferred within the targeted demographic. The data would likely reveal trends or disparities in consumption patterns, highlighting the success of one category over the other. Overall market                  63     35",

Socioeconomic groups AB and E show similar, moderate preferences for large bottles.\n\n**Source: Kantar Worldpanel; data analysis by Dr Giang Trinh, Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.**\n\nNow let’s compare cola with lemonade (see Table 5.11).

Conversely, Cola exhibits its highest market share among individuals under 34 years old (45%). The data also breaks down share by household size and socioeconomic status, revealing minor fluctuations but a consistent dominance of Cola across the board.\n\nIt’s a common assumption that product variants are developed for particular types of buyers. For example, low-allergy fabric conditioner must sell to people who suffer from allergies. In which case, if we examined such variants we would see ‘niche-type’ patterns: such products would sell to a small group of highly loyal buyers. Yet generally this is not what happens. To use the specific example of (no fragrance, no colour) low-allergy fabric conditioners: these are not big sellers and they sell to a few buyers who only occasionally buy them (double jeopardy; see Chapter 2). Their loyalty metrics are barely higher than they should be as predicted by the double jeopardy law.\n\nWhat this means is that unscented low-allergy fabric conditioners mainly sell to normal fabric conditioner buyers who occasionally feel allergic (or at least think about it). There will be a few allergy sufferers who only buy low-allergy fabric conditioners, but these few loyalists’ make up a small part of the variant’s customer base.\n\n**Table 5.12: Double jeopardy law – types of fabric conditioner, US**",

The overall average indicates a purchase frequency of 2.9 and a 39% share of category requirements across all segments. The big discovery is that the customer bases of brands in a category are very similar – except in numbers of buyers.\n\n# Implications\n\nOne way of thinking about it is that there isn’t a vanilla ice-cream buyer and a different type of person who buys strawberry – there are just ice-cream buyers who sometimes buy vanilla and very occasionally buy strawberry.\n\nWhen market research shows that a brand is selling to a different customer profile than competitor brands it’s common practice for marketers to say, “We skew towards young women, so that’s our media target.” But this thinking is incorrect. What they should be asking is, “Why? Is there something wrong with our marketing? Are we failing to reach some demographics (and therefore overweighting in others)?” It’s wrong to assume that a brand appeals to a particular type of buyer; most don’t and they shouldn’t want to. A brand may sell to an unusual customer profile (more of some people and less of others) because it is currently marketed that way, or because of history or mistakes. None of which means that it will sell best if targeted to this audience.\n\nA skew from the category norm needs to be checked carefully. The question is whether to market in line with this skew or to go with the category norm. Usually the answer will be the latter.",

But within these sub-markets there is little difference between brand’s user bases; for example, Versace sells to the same wealthier buyers as Gucci does.<sup>32</sup>\n\nThis is a very positive finding. It means that your brand is unrestrained, in the sense that it can grow its customer base. Because the buyers of other brands are just like your customers – they potentially could be yours. If your buyers were really different from buyers of other brands that would suggest that your brand was suited to a particular type of buyer and not others. That would suggest that you had filled your niche – time for the marketing department to all go home.\n\nBut your niche appears to be the whole market, so there is plenty of growth potential. All that is standing in your way is a degree of brand loyalty, and the fact that you have competitors with similar growth aspirations.

Perhaps it is due to us expecting to see differences. Marketing textbooks tell us that brands have been differentiated and targeted to specific segments. Therefore we expect them to sell to different sorts of customers. Also, many marketing directors find that they have a large portfolio of brands, many inherited in historic company acquisitions. They look for a reason why they have all these very similar brands and conclude that each must appeal to different sorts of buyers, whereas in reality they appeal to different buyers, but not different types of buyers (i.e. they appeal to the particular buyers that know them).\n\n# Competition",

This is what Professor Philip Kotler and colleagues (1998) have written about mass marketing and how brands compete with one another:\n\n> Marketing has passed through three stages:  \n> 1) Mass marketing. [Here] the seller mass produces, mass distributes and mass promotes one product to all buyers. At one time, Coca-Cola produced only one drink for the whole market, hoping it would appeal to everyone. The argument for mass marketing is that it should lead to the lowest costs and prices and create the largest potential market.  \n> 2) Product-variety marketing. Here, the seller produces two or more products that have different features, styles, quality, sizes and so on. Later, Coca-Cola produced several soft drinks packaged in different sizes and containers. They were designed to offer variety to buyers rather than to appeal to different segments. The argument for product-variety marketing is that consumers have different tastes that change over time. Consumers seek variety and change.  \n> 3) Target marketing. Here, the seller identifies market segments, selects one or more of them, and develops products and marketing mixes tailored to each. For example, Coca-Cola now produces soft drinks for the sugared-cola segment, the diet segment, the no-caffeine segment and the non-cola segment.\n\nSellers can develop the right product for each target market and adjust their prices, distribution channels and\n\nadvertising to reach the target market efficiently. Instead of  \nscattering their marketing efforts (the ‘shotgun’ approach),  \nthey can focus on the buyers who have greater purchase  \ninterest (the ‘rifle’ approach).\n\nAccording to Kotler and colleagues (1998), brands are supposed to target  \nsegments of the market, which would severely limit the number of other  \nbrands they compete with.",

It’s difficult to think of a real-world example of  \nmass marketing that fits the extreme definition: few, if any, firms have only  \none product, with one price. It is also unclear how the examples of target  \nmarketing differ from the less sophisticated ‘product-variety marketing’. Yes,  \nCoca-Cola now markets many brands of soft drink, but is this to satisfy the  \ndistinct needs of particular groups of buyers, or to satisfy individual demand  \nfor variety, or a bit of both? Oddly, according to Kotler, offering containers of  \ndifferent sizes caters for variety seeking, but different flavours cater for  \ndifferent people!\n\nSimply naming a segment does not make it exist. We could similarly create  \n‘segment’ names to match Kotler’s product-variety strategy (e.g. the high  \nquality seeking segment, the large pack economy oriented segment, and so  \non). However, for this to have any meaning there would need to be empirical  \nevidence that each of Coca-Cola’s brands really does sell to different people.  \nKotler presents no data to substantiate his claims.\n\nTable 6.1 shows that various soft drink brands share their customer base with  \nCoca-Cola; that is, the table shows what proportion of each soft drink brand’s  \ncustomers also bought Coca-Cola during the analysis period. The data is from  \nthe Kantar Impulse Panel, which I have specifically chosen because it covers  \nindividual consumers buying for their personal use. Therefore, the repertoire  \nof brand buying shown in the table is not due to different brands being bought  \nby different people in the same household.\n\n**Table 6.1:** Sharing of customers\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of buyers of product X, detailing the percentage of these buyers who also purchased (regular) Coca-Cola during the same period. The structure highlights the overlap in purchasing behavior across different consumer segments for product X. Specifically, it shows that buyers of Diet Coke had a 65% overlap with regular Coca-Cola purchasers, while Fanta buyers showed a 70% overlap. Lift buyers exhibited a 67% overlap, and Pepsi buyers demonstrated the highest overlap at 72%. The average overlap across all analyzed buyer groups for product X and regular Coca-Cola was 69%, indicating a significant cross-purchasing trend.",

Several of the brands are even marketed by the Coca-Cola company; these brands share their customers with Coca-Cola as much as rival company’s brands do.\n\nCustomer-sharing data gives insight into who competes against whom. If brands are close rivals, then they should be in the repertoires of the same people, that is, they share customers<sup>35</sup>. Logically, brands that are direct competitors within a product category should show higher levels of sharing, and brands that target different segments should share fewer customers.\n\n# Duplication of purchase analysis\n\nThe extraordinary fact about the sharing analysis is not that Pepsi buyers also buy Coca-Cola (although this surprises some people), but that each brand shares a near identical proportion of its customer base with Coca-Cola.\n\nThe exact degree of sharing depends on the period of analysis. If it is long enough, then nearly all of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola, whereas over a very short time period a smaller proportion of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola. However, the length of time affects all brands equally, so it doesn’t affect inter-brand comparisons. Irrespective of the time period, each brand of soft drink shares a similar proportion of its consumers with Coca-Cola.\n\nThis suggests that all the brands compete *equally closely* with Coca-Cola, and that none of them sell to special discrete segments of buyers. Perhaps this is because Coca-Cola is so large. Perhaps no soft drink brand can get away from competing with Coke. But how do brands compete with less ubiquitous brands? Let’s now expand the analysis to consider all brands in a category.\n\nA ‘duplication of purchase’ table<sup>36</sup> shows the degree to which brands within a category share their buyers with each of the other brands in the category (i.e. what proportion of their customers also bought another particular brand during the period). Table 6.2 is a duplication of purchase table with no data.\n\n**Table 6.2:** Duplication of purchase, a table without data",

The table is structured with brands A, B, C, and D listed along the rows and columns. The diagonal entries, representing the percentage of buyers who also bought the same brand, are all 100%. The off-diagonal entries are empty, implying no data is presented for buyers of one brand also purchasing another. This structure highlights a self-purchasing pattern for each brand individually, without indicating any cross-brand purchasing relationships or cannibalization effects. The overarching structure is comparative, examining each brand's purchasing behavior in isolation. The 100% cells are a brand’s level of customer overlap with itself, which logically must always be 100%.\n\nIn terms of the presentation of the data, it’s good practice to blank out these cells because they are not needed.\n\nDuplication of purchase tables refer to a particular time period, for example, the people during the year who bought brand A who also bought brand B. Note that a buyer of brand A needs to only make one purchase of brand B to be counted. Consequently, duplication analyses that apply to very long periods can be misleading, because every brand may show very high levels of sharing with every other brand, which obscures who competes more or less closely. At the other end of the time spectrum, in very short time periods there is often no duplication (because many customers have only bought the category once), which is also misleading. The analyst should choose a period long enough to capture a degree of repeated purchase, that is, a period long enough to allow most people to have bought multiple brands. Readers of duplication tables need to note that they refer to a particular period, there is never an absolute metric; one can’t simply say, ‘70% of Pepsi buyers drink Coke’ – it’s 70% **in a year**.\n\n# The duplication of purchase law\n\nLet’s look at a duplication of purchase table for ice-cream brands (see Table 6.3).\n\n**Table 6.3:** Duplication of purchase – ice-cream, 2005",

The table outlines the percentage of buyers for specific brands, including (Walls) Carte D’Or, Walls Dessert, Ben & Jerry’s, Häagen Dazs, Nestle, Walls, and Mars, as perceived by various buyer segments. Each row represents a buyer group, and the columns indicate the percentage of those buyers who associate with each listed brand. The structure is a matrix, allowing for direct comparison of how each buyer segment views the different brands. A final row provides the average percentage across all buyer groups for each brand, offering an overall view of brand recognition and association. The data highlights varying levels of brand penetration and perception across distinct consumer bases within the premium ice cream market. *Source: Kantar Worldpanel, UK.*\n\nThere are three striking patterns in the above table:\n\n1. Every brand shares much more of its customer base with the largest brand, Carte D’Or, than with Mars, the brand with the smallest market share.\n\n2. There is similarity in the degree of sharing with any particular brand. For example, all brands share 40% of their customers (+ or - only a few percentage points) with Carte D’Or during the period of analysis.\n\n3. There are a few deviations to the first two patterns. For example, Ben Jerry’s shares more than expected with Häagen Dazs.\n\nThe first two patterns reflect what is known as the duplication of purchase law. This law says that all brands, within a category, share their customer base with other brands in line with the size of those other brands. In other words, everyone shares a lot with big brands and a little with small brands.\n\nThe duplication of purchase law would not hold if several brands successfully targeted exclusive customer bases, or particular types of people who are different from the buyers of other brands<sup>37</sup>. However, as we saw in Chapter 5, rival brands sell to very similar customer bases.\n\nIn Table 6.3 the brands are ranked in market share order, both across columns and rows, so you can easily see that the duplication of customers declines in line with this rank. Every brand shares most with Carte D’Or because it is the largest brand – it has about three times the penetration of most of the other brands in the table.",

      "content": "Armed with knowledge of the duplication of purchase law, it is possible to spot market partitions: clusters of brands whose customer bases overlap more than expected. The law can also be used to spot brands that show unusually low overlap in their customer bases.\n\nThe ice-cream buying data covers premium and not-so-premium brands, brands only sold in large tubs and brands only sold as bars/cones. This affects their distribution, as some outlets only stock large tubs and some only stock small bars/cones. Given these notable functional differences we should expect a partitioned market. The real surprise is how unpartitioned it is; in other words, the market is not far off being one mass market.\n\nNow that is an insight!\n\nThe only obvious partition is the premium brands Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen Dazs sharing with each other almost double the amount of customers that they share with other brands; though it is worth observing that Ben & Jerry’s customers are still more likely to buy Carte D’Or than Häagen Dazs. However, the duplication of purchase law has been bent a little, rather than broken.\n\nMarketers often fall into the trap of underestimating how broadly their brand really competes. Segmentation studies overstate very small differences, and it’s assumed that brands with different features (e.g. price levels) must sell to very different people, or for very different buying situations. These assumptions are often unrealistic or exaggerated. It is useful to start the duplication of purchase analysis with a very broad market definition, then if partitions appear, undertake separate duplication analyses, for example, a separate premium ice-cream category and an everyday ice-cream category.\n\n# Potential uses\n\nThe duplication of purchase law can be used to find partitions and, therefore, to understand the structure of a market. The law can provide a consumer-buying based guide to define the product category. This can be extremely useful, if only to reduce the debates between managers about category definition. Importantly, it can help prevent the blinkered, production-oriented vision that comes from category definitions based on product features or production processes. These are rife, and are typically too narrow. For example, the chocolate market can be divided into dozens of sub-markets – block, bars, pieces, individually wrapped, candy coated, chocolate coated candy, and so on.\n\nThese product-based category definitions can blind managers to their true competitors and prevent them from understanding how customers actually buy.",

      "content": "Ehrenberg-Bass Institute researcher John Bound used to tell a lovely story about when he was a market research manager for Quaker Oats in the UK. At the time research suppliers thought there was a hot breakfast cereal category and a cold breakfast cereal category (among others). Then one day someone pointed out that the cold breakfast cereals still sold well in the middle of (a very cold English) winter. Researchers were immediately sent out into the field to investigate what was going on; they discovered the naughty consumers were putting hot milk on their cold breakfast cereal^38 This example shows that product-oriented category definitions isolate brand managers from real buying behaviour.\n\nEven consumption situation-based category definitions (e.g. for snacking, for sharing, for gifting) commonly result in artificial overly narrow category definitions. The reality is that few brands are exclusively bought for specific consumption situations, and which brands are bought for which situation varies between consumers and over time.\n\nNarrow category definitions lull brand managers into a false sense of security and can result in unduly conservative growth targets. Brand managers prefer category definitions that make their brand appear to have a substantial market share – no one like to be ranked seventeenth. Therefore, narrow category definitions are commonly adopted. These also make growth potential, particularly penetration potential, appear more limited than it really is.\n\nIn addition to giving guidance regarding category definition, and showing which brands compete with which, the duplication of purchase law can also be used to predict where new brands will steal sales from. In this way the law can be used to estimate cannibalisation of sales of sister brands. This is essential for planning the launch of a new product.\n\nThe duplication of purchase law also shows up in customer defection and acquisition. A brand will gain most of its new customers from the largest brands, and will also lose more of its customers to larger brands. Therefore, the law can be used as benchmark for customer defection and acquisition to and from each of a brand’s competitors. For example, if a brand is losing more customers to another brand than you would expect given that brand’s size, then this indicates some unusual overlap in marketing strategy (perhaps the competing brand has opened a store close by?).\n\n# Marketing strategy insight",

The fact that there is such a natural law (that describes sharing in most categories rather well) tells us about how brands compete in general. We live and work in a world of mass markets. Ben Jerry’s and Häagen Dazs, while they are close competitors, also compete against all other ice-cream brands, especially large ones like Carte D’Or. Such patterns hold around the world and in different product/service categories. For example, customer gains for BMW in France come more from large non-premium brands like Renault, Citroën and Peugeot than from smaller luxury brands like Mercedes and Audi (Ehrenberg 1999).\n\nPartitions exist in markets; premium quality/price partitions are particularly common. But it is sensible to think of these divisions as sub-markets (partitions) rather than as entirely separate markets.\n\n# Positioning and partitioning\n\nThis story of customer overlap is at odds with the picture provided by perceptual maps (and other brand image analyses). This picture is usually of some brands competing closely with each other, and very indirectly with other brands in the competitive set. A typical perceptual map might look like Figure 6.1 (the brands are marked in circles).\n\n**Figure 6.1:** Perceptual map – flavoured milk\n\nThis table presents a comparative analysis of different brands, likely beverages, based on various attributes. The central axis appears to differentiate brands based on their target demographic and perceived qualities, with \"low fat, healthy, new, unpopular, nutritious, minor brand, women, beautiful people\" representing one cluster of attributes. Contrasting this are attributes like \"working class, hangover cure, hi caffeine\" associated with the \"Max\" brand, and \"fresh, ugly people\" linked to the \"FU\" brand. Further distinctions are made with \"yuppie brand\" and \"premium brand\" attributes, alongside \"fattening\" and \"childrens brand\" associated with \"DV\". The \"sweet\" attribute is also noted, suggesting a taste dimension. The structure is comparative, highlighting how different brands are positioned across a spectrum of consumer perceptions and product characteristics.",

      "content": "As far as market partitions, there is one clear partition involving Take Care and Feel Good. These brands share customers to a far higher degree than the duplication of purchase law would predict (see the numbers in bold in Table 6.4). The Take Care and Feel Good products both have zero sugar and low fat – as suggested by their names. These functional differences show up both in duplication of purchase and in the perceptual map.\n\nThe perceptual map correctly shows that Take Care and Feel Good are close competitors, but it exaggerates the degree to which these brands are isolated from competition with the other brands. Both these brands still share more customers with the large brand Farmers’ Union than they do with each other – many consumers buy both. In general, perceptual maps often suggest more market segmentation than really exists (Sharp 1997b). This is partly due to the underlying statistical methods, which are designed to highlight differences; these methods are also sensitive to outliers in the data set.\n\n# Implications for brand portfolio management\n\nShould marketers worry if their company has several similar brands? Should these brands be collapsed together, should some be dropped, or should marketers strive to position them differently?\n\nShould they worry about having brands that “tread on each others toes”? In general, the answer is don’t worry.\n\nCompanies often have similar brands that sell to similar populations. Coke has Diet Coke and Coke Zero (and Regular Coke). Mars have the Mars Bar and Snickers. P&G has Tampax and Always. General Motors has Saturn, Astra and Chevy Aveo. This isn’t something to worry about. It’s normal for brands in a category to compete against one another and to sell to near identical customer bases. Even brands that are obviously quite different (e.g. KFC and McDonalds, Visa and AmEx) still directly compete.\n\nHeinz doesn’t worry that it offers tomato soup as well as vegetable soup. Similarly a marketer shouldn’t worry about their company having similar brands. If a new soft drink company could choose to own and market any two global brands, should it choose Coke and Fanta? No, it should choose Coke and Pepsi, because these are the biggest brands globally, with the most valuable market-based assets.",

If they are not, the brand’s advertising won’t work – and consumers won’t see the product on the shelf. So brands should look different (this is what branding is about) even if they don’t compete as differentiated brands (see Chapter 8).\n\nMarketers should also worry about the total portfolio effects of price promotions. When one of a company’s brands is on special, this not only takes full-priced sales that would have happened anyway, it also steals full-priced sales from the company’s other brands.\n\nIf brands grow they will always steal from the other brands in the same product category. The exact amount of cannibalisation that will occur between brands can be predicted by the duplication of purchase law. What you need to watch out for is excessive cannibalisation. Companies tend to be good at stealing sales from themselves because their brands go through the same sales force, the same distributors, etc. Marketers need to acknowledge and accept this, but to also be on the look-out for excessive cannibalisation.\n\nFinally, the decision to drop, phase out or sell brands should be based on viability, cost and operating issues; not on how similar the brand is to another of the company’s brands. This is especially true if the brands are well established with substantial market-based assets.\n\n# Modern sophisticated mass marketing Markets are usually a little fragmented, but within commonsense definitions they still largely function as mass markets.\n\nThe small degree of fragmentation is often catered for by brand variants[^39], which leaves marketers still needing to know how to compete in a mass market. This is Kotler’s ‘product-variety marketing’, which is a type of mass marketing.",

For example, Colgate provides numerous varieties, each of which is supposed to successfully target and meet the needs of specific consumers. “These include ‘normal’ toothpaste, gel toothpaste, children’s toothpaste, tooth whitening toothpastes, anti-bacterial, tartar control, toothpaste for sensitive teeth, and toothpaste with extra strong fluoride” (Kotler et al. 1998). However, there is little evidence that Colgate actually targets specific market segments. To say there is a tartar control segment as shown by the tartar control toothpaste is circular logic. Kotler and colleagues (1998, p. 296) tell us that segment marketers “develop the right product for each target market and adjust their prices, distribution channels and advertising to reach the target market efficiently”. But this does not hold up to scrutiny in the Colgate example (and for Coca-Cola discussed earlier). Colgate does not use different distribution channels for their tartar control product. In fact their products are all on the same shelf, in the same stores, put there by the same merchandisers. The products’ prices are often within cents of one another and, while there might be different ads for some products (alongside much corporate brand advertising), these ads typically appear in the same (mass) media – television ads in particular are known for their wide, unsegmented reach (see Sharp et al 2009 for evidence). The difference in each product’s marketing mix is limited to the difference that exists between each product variant. The role of advertising is largely to “bring to public notice” that different products exist and are available. These marketing practices fit perfectly Kotler’s definition of mass, product-variety marketing – which is exactly the marketing situation that most firms find themselves in.",

This means being aware of the considerable heterogeneity within the mass market; for example, in purchase frequency and in the brands that individuals buy. Within the mass market there are lots of different buyers. Sophisticated mass marketers cleverly react to this heterogeneity (e.g. by marketing multiple brands and variants, by using multiple media and distribution channels).\n\nRather than trying to hem their brands into niches, they are always looking for avenues to broad reach.",

The sportswear market has a plethora of similar competing brands (Reebok, Puma, New Balance and Coq Sportif)<sup>40</sup>; one explanation for this brand proliferation is that marketers have used advertising and packaging to fool buyers into adopting irrational preferences and loyalties. This explanation has been put forward by both opponents and advocates of advertising and branding. There are plenty of psychological studies that support this argument, but they also suggest advertising and packaging have a very weak psychological effect (even under laboratory conditions).\n\nTwo widely reported (and misreported) psychological studies are typical. Each purports to show that branding can massively distort preferences. In one study (McClure et al. 2004) 16 of the subjects undertook blind taste tests and about half chose Pepsi and half chose Coke. Their choice in the blind tests correlated poorly with the preference they stated prior to the test: about the same number of those who had stated they preferred Coke chose Pepsi in the blind trial, and about the same number of subjects who preferred Pepsi chose Coke.\n\nOther subjects were each given two samples of the same cola. One sample was identified as either Coke or Pepsi, while the brand of the other sample was not revealed – subjects were told that the second unidentified cola could be either Coke or Pepsi (though in reality it was always the same cola as the first sample).<sup>41</sup> When the labelled cola was Coke, subjects largely said it tasted best. The same did not occur when Pepsi was the identified cola. This may have been due to the groups consisting of more people who usually tend to drink Coca-Cola (prior preferences were not checked, or at least not reported).",

An fMRI scan involves lying on a hard flat board inside an extremely loud (and, for some, claustrophobic, chamber). It is not a pleasant experience, and certainly different from most normal consumption situations! The main finding was that when subjects were told that Coke was the cola they were sipping more brain activity was recorded in the hippocampus and in other brain areas thought to be concerned with cultural knowledge and memories. This did not occur quite so much for Pepsi.\n\nWhat does this convoluted experiment tell us? First, in artificial tasting situations people are far more likely to trust their eyes than their sense of taste, this phenomenon has been observed across decades of taste testing research. They also may react as if it were a test – that their performance is being judged, not just the colas. So informing them that one cup contains their favourite cola (or non-favourite cola) largely overrides their taste buds – which is especially easy when the other cup contains the same cola (i.e. there is no difference between the two cups). Second, the brain scans probably reflect something that psychologists have known for decades: familiarity breeds liking. Usage also breeds familiarity and brand knowledge; this in turn breeds liking.",

In this research (Robinson et al. 2007), 63 children aged between three and five years old were given two identical food items to taste. One item was in plain wrapping and the other was in McDonald’s branded wrapping. The food items were McDonald’s hamburgers, chicken McNuggets, McDonald’s French fries, milk, and two baby carrots. With each exposure of a food item, for example, McDonald’s French fries, the child was asked, “Can you tell me which of these foods is from McDonald’s?” If the child did not answer or answered incorrectly the administrator pointed to the McDonald’s branded option and said, “This food is from McDonald’s”; this happened about a third of the time. Each child was then instructed to take a bite of each of the two options and the administrator then asked, “Tell me if they taste the same or point to the food [drink] that tastes best to you”. The children chose the branded option (as tasting best) 182 times. They chose the unbranded option 122 times or said they both tasted the same (or that they did not know).\n\nThe more regularly a child ate at McDonald’s (as reported by their parents), the more likely they were to choose the branded item.\n\nAlso, children with more television sets in their home were more likely to select the branded item. But other moderator variables – having a television in the bedroom, having McDonald’s toys in the house, and hours of television viewing – had no detectable influence.\n\nDecades of testing preferences and quality cues has taught us that when a single cue is introduced into a study respondents react strongly to it. This is probably because subjects feel they are supposed to react to the cue.\n\nBecause it is the only cue, it becomes artificially salient. *It is surprising that these sorts of artificial studies are still being done.* Similar weak preferential results might probably be gained by simply wrapping one of the items in coloured paper and the other in plain.",

What is worth noting though is how mild the effects are, even in these artificial constructions. The main finding again seems to be that prior usage of the brand makes a person slightly more favourable towards it. This is one of the psychological factors underpinning brand loyalty.\n\n# Brand loyalty – a natural part of buying behaviour\n\nBrand loyalty is part of every market, even in so called commodity categories. Rather than thinking of loyalty as a market imperfection, it is more appropriately considered to be a sensible buyer strategy, one of many developed by human beings in order to balance risk and avoid wasting the precious commodity of time.\n\nIn 1964 Professor Tucker of Texas University conducted an interesting experiment into the development of brand loyalty. His experiment revealed that buyers naturally tend towards brand loyalty – loyalty is a buying strategy that most of us adopt much of the time. In Tucker’s experiment, each day, for 12 days, loaves of bread from the same commercial oven were offered on a tray for choice to 42 women. The loaves were wrapped identically, and each day one was labelled L, another M, P and H. The position of the brands on the tray was rotated. In spite of the loaves being identical, many of the respondents quickly adopted loyal behaviours, with each woman favouring a particular brand. Some also favoured positions on the tray (e.g. tending to choose the brand that was on the left of the tray). This landmark study concluded that it is clear that brand loyalty is based on what may seem to be trivial distinctions.",

It could be argued that buyers are used to more substantial differences in real-world brands and so acted as if there might be in this study. Also, tastes vary day by day, and maybe the bread varied too – if one day a loaf didn’t taste so good to a subject perhaps she avoided that brand on the following days. Even so, the study did show that consumers have a predilection to adopt loyalty behaviours, for whatever reason. This is further shown by the fact that brand loyalty is a characteristic of every market.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we saw that repeat-purchasing levels for car brands are quite high. That is, around 50% repeat levels (with some variation between countries); almost half the time new car buyers buy the same brand as they bought last time. This level of repeat-buying seems incredible considering that in modern market economies there are typically 60 or so brands to choose from. Also, usually a number of years pass between purchases, models change, as do buyer’s life circumstances and needs. The odds of someone choosing the same car brand again appears to be very slim. If buying were random, there would be less than 1 chance in 50 of a person purchasing the same brand again. But buying is not random; there is clear behavioural preference and loyalty.\n\nWe observe this sort of loyalty in all categories, including service categories and corporate buying. Buyers restrict their purchases to a personal repertoire of brands. People buy far fewer different brands than they could. Ten purchases seldom results in ten different brands being bought. Buyers keep returning to their favourites<sup>42</sup>, and this set of favourites can be very small. The 50% repeat-buying rate for car brands occurs because buyers consider only around two brands on average; one of which is usually the brand they bought last time (i.e. the brand they drive now) (Lambert-Pandraud 2005). About a fifth of buyers consider only a single brand, which is almost always the one they bought last (Lapersonne 1995). Yet this is what consumer behaviour textbooks refer to as a ‘highly involving purchase decision’!",

Most of us think we watch television for the programs, and, aside from the genre-specific channels (e.g. the weather channel), we have only a vague idea of what channel offers our favourite programs. Also, there are no real switching costs: we can defect from one channel by pushing a button. In spite of all this, television channel choice shows the same pattern as other categories – people substantially restrict their repertoires and show loyalty.\n\nFigure 7.1 was compiled by Ehrenberg-Bass Institute researcher Dr Virginia Beal; it is based on Nielsen data on US households. The figure shows the number of television channels each household has access to in their subscription and how many they actually watch. The key point is how quickly the line flattens; when a household has access to 40 channels they watch about a dozen or so each week, households with access to 80 channels watch a few more than a dozen each week, and households with access to 200 channels still only watch a few more than a dozen each week.\n\n**Figure 7.1:** Number of television channels viewed per week in US households\n\nThis data illustrates a relationship between the number of channels a household has access to and the number of channels they actually view. Initially, as the number of accessible channels increases from 0 to approximately 70, the number of viewed channels also shows a corresponding increase, rising from 0 to 16. However, beyond roughly 70 accessible channels, the number of viewed channels plateaus and remains constant at 16, even as the number of accessible channels continues to rise significantly, up to 200. This suggests a saturation point where additional channel availability does not lead to increased viewing.\n\n*Nielsen, 2002*",

What this shows is that viewers (sensibly) keep returning to their favourite channels. There is obvious loyalty. Most viewers watch enough television to watch many more channels than they do, but they prefer to restrict their personal repertoire. They learn the channel numbers of their favourites and go there first. The chart looks almost identical if we examine brand buying in any category, for example, if it instead showed the number of purchases made by an individual and how many different brands they had bought (see Figure 7.2). Loyalty is everywhere, from soap to soap operas.\n\n**Figure 7.2:** Breakfast cereal purchasing, Australia; data courtesy of Nielsen.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of the number of different brands bought against the number of category purchases. The structure appears to be a distribution or frequency count, where specific ranges of category purchases correspond to a percentage of different brands bought. Specifically, approximately 40% of category purchases involve buying only 1 brand, while the percentage decreases as the number of different brands bought increases. A significant portion, around 32.2%, of category purchases involve buying 6-9 different brands, and 24.4% involve 15-17 different brands. The data further indicates that 16.6% of category purchases involve 22-25 different brands, and 8.8% involve 29-31 different brands. A very small percentage, 1.0%, is associated with the highest number of brands bought, though the exact upper limit for this category is not explicitly defined beyond the 29-31 range.\n\n</div>\n\n# Divided loyalty\n\nLoyalty is everywhere but it’s seldom exclusive – buyers purchase more than one brand, and the more purchases an individual makes the more brands he or she buys.

The average for this selection of brands is 13% of their buyer base. The double jeopardy law holds again for this loyalty metric: smaller brands have a smaller proportion of their customer base who are 100% loyal. All these brands are among the major brands in their respective categories – the metric is even lower for very small brands.\n\nNotice that categories that are purchased less frequently have higher levels of 100% loyalty. Analgesics are bought only five times a year on average, and because this is a skewed average (see Chapter 4), more than half of all households bought from the category only once. These once-only buyers, by definition, have to appear among the 100% loyal buyers – if you only buy once then you can buy only one brand. As time goes by these buyers make more purchases and the proportion that are 100% loyal drops dramatically. This can be seen in categories like breakfast cereals and yoghurts, which are bought more frequently and so show much lower levels of 100% brand loyalty.\n\n**Table 7.1:** 100% loyal buyers are the minority\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of different product categories, detailing brand performance within each. For Analgesics, Tesco leads with a 22% purchase rate and 37% loyal buyers, followed by Nurofen, Boots, and Panadol. In Deodorants, Lynx has the highest purchase rate at 17% and 21% loyalty, with Dove, Tesco, and Nivea trailing. Crisps (potato chips) are dominated by Walkers, holding a 68% purchase rate and 37% loyalty, significantly ahead of KP and Kettle Foods. Breakfast cereals show Kelloggs as the market leader with 29% purchase rate and 7% loyalty, followed by Cereal Partners and Weet-Bix. Yoghurts are led by Muller at 24% purchase rate and 7% loyalty, with Muller Light, Ski, and Danone also listed. An overall average across all categories indicates a 13% market share and 13% buyer loyalty. **Source: Kantar Worldpanel, UK, 2005.**",

      "content": "The standout in the table 7.1 is Walkers potato crisp brand: one-third of its buyers were exclusively loyal over the time period (one year). Yet this level of 100% loyalty is normal for a brand with such extraordinary market share.<sup>43</sup> Walkers dominates the UK potato chip market, and has incredible availability; this makes it very easy for buyers to only buy Walkers, particularly if they don’t make many purchases. The double jeopardy law again.\n\nPolygamous loyalty is seen in panels that record the buying of individuals – so it isn’t due simply to different members of the household having different loyalties (McDonald et al 2000, 2002). It is also seen in the industrial buying of individual companies (Uncles et al 1990, Pickford & Goodhardt 2000).\n\n# Natural monopoly law\n\nLarger brands tend to have proportionately more light category buyers in their user bases. Light, occasional buyers favour the bigger brands. This isn’t that they particularly prefer larger brands, it is purely a statistical effect and is known as the ‘Natural Monopoly Law’ (i.e.\n\nlarger brands have a monopoly on light buyers). For example, if you only buy one soft drink this year, then odds are it will be Coca-Cola. If you buy just one pack of crisps in the UK, then odds are it will be Walkers.\n\nPut another way, if we observe an English person eating Walkers crisps then we know little about their buying. They are simply part of the majority of the UK population who buy Walkers at some time or another. But if we observe someone eating a far smaller brand like Golden Wonder crisps then odds are that the person is higher than average buyer of salty snacks.\n\nThe implication for marketing strategy is that to grow a brand needs to recruit more light category buyers. Targeting the heaviest buyers of the category (‘super consumers’) is a bit like saying “let’s be a small brand”.\n\nThe natural monopoly law is illustrated with the data in Table 7.2. Heinz buyers purchase tomato sauce four times a year, whereas buyers of C&B sauce buy tomato sauce eight times a year, that is, twice as often<sup>44</sup> (though C&B is only, on average, bought for 1.2 of these eight purchases).\n\n**Table 7.2: Smaller brands are bought by heavier category buyers**",

Heinz dominates the market with a 53% market share and 50% penetration, indicating widespread consumer adoption. Its customers purchase Heinz an average of 2.9 times per annum, contributing to a total of 4 annual purchases of any tomato sauce. In contrast, Daddies sauce holds a 4% market share and 5% penetration, with consumers buying it twice annually, and a higher overall frequency of 6 annual tomato sauce purchases. C&B sauce has the smallest market presence at 1% share and 2% penetration, yet its consumers exhibit the highest frequency of buying any tomato sauce at 8 times per annum, with individual C&B purchases averaging 1.2 times. The structure is comparative, highlighting key performance indicators across different brands.\n\n*Data source: Kantar Worldpanel*\n\nTherefore, larger brands have more 100% loyal buyers partly because they have a lot of very light category buyers who haven’t made many purchases during the analysis period.\n\nIf we use a longer analysis period, the proportion of 100% loyal buyers always declines. Give people sufficient time to make multiple purchases and they will buy more brands.\n\nLoyalty certainly exists, but it is tempered by opportunity. People who buy from a category less often have less opportunity to be disloyal. Similarly, people who shop from stores that stock few brands also appear more loyal (e.g. people who live in smaller towns).\n\n# Prosaic, not passionate, loyalty\n\nSo this is the everyday story of loyalty that we gain from observing people’s real buying behaviour over time.<sup>45</sup> In the real world loyalty is everywhere, and every brand has some, but loyalty is divided and strongly driven by opportunity.\n\nThis is a more prosaic picture than most marketing textbooks and consultants paint.\n\n# LOVEMARKS?",

Her coffee brand helps Sara reinforce a positive identity in a developmentally crucial time in her life. In addition to leaving the midwestern farm that defines her legacy, Sara has recently declared her sexual orientation as a lesbian. In some sense, the overt self-indulgence implied in the brand helps Sara explicitly maintain her sense of self-respect in the face of social challenges to her pronouncement.\n>\n> *Paraphrased from Fornier, S and Yao, J.

It’s not enough to merely build and maintain sales and deliver profits to stockholders; they are told they also have to get consumers to feel a deep, passionate commitment to their brand. It’s no longer sufficient to have consumers who pay money to buy the brand; they have to also love the brand.\n\nThis sounds like a very tough task, yet, perversely, many marketers embrace the idea, perhaps because merely selling things sounds crass.

      "content": "So it was a marketing masterstroke of Facebook to use the (ridiculously over-the-top) term ‘fan’ for any Facebook user who merely happened to once click the Like button on a post that came from the brand. Of course besotted marketers clamoured to build their Facebook ‘fan bases’.\n\nThis marketing orthodoxy means that it is derogatory to suggest to a brand manager that the loyalty his or her brand enjoys is due to habit, availability, and/or lack of caring on behalf of buyers. Academics have long derided such buying behaviour with pernicious terms such as ‘spurious loyalty’.<sup>46</sup> Marketing consultants and professors urge brand managers to build deep relationships with their buyers. While market researchers offer tools that guarantee to find (some) passionately loyal buyers.\n\nConsumers can apparently even have deep attachments to cheap everyday consumer goods. In 1997 a highly respected academic journal included an article based on long (2-3.5 hours), paid interviews with eight coffee drinkers (see text box at the start of this section for a flavour of the article). The authors of the article proposed that consumers have deep and complex relationships with (coffee) brands – and somehow their research findings turned out perfectly in line with their prior beliefs.\n\nIf you think that is all just a bit silly you’ll be dismayed by the lead article in the March 2012 volume of our discipline’s top cited journal (the Journal of Marketing) titled “Brand Love”. Qualitative interviews were followed by a one-off cheap online survey of 268 US undergraduate college students at a single university. The students were asked to pick a consumer electronic brand they loved, and another they felt “mostly neutral, not love, about”, and were then asked 59 largely attitudinal questions about each. No surprise that the iPod was the most chosen brand, the authors didn’t mention the popularity of digital music with college students but instead attributed this love to the fact that it allowed personalising of music selection, and that “the iPod’s industral design (the simplicity of its click-wheel mechanism and menu navigation) is likely to promote a sense of natural and intuitive fit”. What this psycho-babble has to do with brand love is beyond me, and obviously beyond Apple too, as they have dropped the click wheel.",

To put this another way, any brand manager will find that only a tiny number of their buyers have anything that approaches love for the brand.\n\nAnother such academic article (titled “Emotional Branding Pays Off”) that desperately tried to hype up the importance of brand love actually found that a mere 4% of the average Australian beer brand’s male buyers ticked the survey box “I would say that I feel deep affection for this brand, like ‘love’, and would be really upset if I couldn’t have it”. If an Australian male can’t get emotional about beer brands then what brands can anyone get emotional about? And these few brand lovers reported only buying the brand half the time (i.e. they mostly bought other brands they did not love).\n\nSadly I expect a raft of misguided PhD theses on brand love over the next decade, as academia falls in and then out of love with its latest fad.\n\nWhile it may be new to academia, the idea that consumers have ‘relationships’ with brands is an old idea, which is routinely repackaged by marketing consultants.

      "content": "To quote, “Lovemarks are brands that create an intimate emotional connection that you simply can’t do without. Ever.” (Roberts 2004).<sup>47</sup>  \nA more down-to-earth view is that if buyers don’t care deeply about a brand then they could be easily lured away to buy another brand. Yet even this supposedly commonsense statement is actually an untested empirical assumption. It’s just as plausible to argue that a lack of caring is the cornerstone of ongoing loyalty.\n\n# Connection to a brand\n\nConsumers are busy people. They have hundreds of thousands of brands vying for their attention. Thanks to the competitive modern economy, and government regulation, most of these options are sound. Therefore, the choice of brand is trivial compared to the decision of whether or not to purchase from the category. And aside from cars, houses and a minority of other categories, even the decision to buy from the category is a minor one – “Shall I have a snack or wait until lunch?”\n\nBrands are a necessary evil: they add a layer of complexity to the buying decision, but they also allow for routines (“Ah, there’s my brand” or, “Oh yes, I’ve heard of that one”); such habits make buying easier – automatic even. From cars to canned soup, routine results in passionless<sup>48</sup> brand loyalty. Also, we’re usually so unaware of our habits that we barely notice that we eat the same meals, shop from the same shops, etc. And, as we’ve seen, loyalty is rarely exclusive; it’s nothing like loyalty to a sports team or a country. Buyers typically have a number of brands that they routinely buy, so 100% exclusive loyalty is much rarer than marketers expect.\n\nMarketing texts sometimes dismiss these buying patterns as simply a case of the messy real world deflecting customers from their true intentions. But this interpretation doesn’t fit the facts when attitudes, perceptions and intentions are measured. Consumers’ thoughts and plans also show this prosaic uncommitted loyalty.\n\n# Brand knowledge, attitudes and intentions\n\nLong ago marketing wisdom was that Avis buyers rented from Avis and Hertz buyers rented from Hertz. So if Hertz had 23% market share in a particular country, it was assumed that 23% of car renters used Hertz. As soon as marketing scientists starting looking at ongoing panel records of real-world repeat buying they realised the error of their assumption.",

In the long term, 23% market share means that most category consumers use Hertz, but on average, they only use Hertz not much more than 23% of the time.\n\nThe story is similar with attitudes, perceptions and intentions (i.e. people’s thoughts about brands). If surveys show that 30% of people say Hertz rents attractive cars then the common assumption is that 30% of people believe this and 70% don’t. While the reality is that a lot of people believe this (or remember they believe this), but just not all of the time.\n\nLet me explain. We can see the fickle (actually probabilistic) nature of people’s beliefs if we ask them the same question more than once. This is seldom done in market and social research. Surveys generally ask different people each time, which is why even experienced market researchers are generally unaware of this phenomenon.<sup>49</sup> If, on the first survey, 30% of people agreed with the statement, “Hertz rents attractive cars”, then on any subsequent survey the figure is also usually very close to 30%. This (misleadingly) suggests that the individuals largely always give the same response, either agreeing or not agreeing with the statement. But, if we analyse the answers of each individual we see something startling. Typically, only about half the people who on the first survey agreed with the statement do so again on the second survey, and an equal number of people who did not agree with the statement the first time now agree with it. So the overall level of agreement remains at 30% but the repeat or stability rate (people saying yes both times) is only half (i.e. 50%).

Table 7.4 gives examples across different attitudinal or image statements and across different categories. We can see that the repeat rate varies from brand to brand; it also varies across different beliefs. That’s because the repeat rate largely depends on the overall response (agreement) level for that belief and brand. Logically, if on each survey 100% of respondents agreed with a statement (e.g. “How Brands Grow is a superb book”) then the repeat rate must also be 100% – each survey can only record a score of 100%. However, for beliefs that score less than 100% their repeat rate could be 100% or it could be lower (i.e. a score of 30% in each survey could be because 30% of people agree on every interview, or everyone agrees but only 30% of the time, or something in between). In the real world we find the repeat agreement level is almost always far lower than 100%. In fact we can predict the repeat rate based on the level of initial agreement (Dall’Olmo Riley 1997) – this is the whole story, the repeat rate has surprisingly little to do with the type of belief or other factors.<sup>50</sup>\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of brand image beliefs across different service categories, specifically contrasting initial agreement percentages with repeated agreement percentages. For fast food outlets, the belief \"Good for a snack\" shows a significant increase from 29% initial to 56% repeated agreement. Banks exhibit similar patterns, with \"Progressive\" rising from 22% to 47% and \"Expert in the areas it deals in\" from 21% to 48%. Insurance sees a substantial jump for \"Provides fast service\" from 17% to 42%. Supermarkets, with the belief \"Sells low-quality fruit,\" move from 14% to 36% repeated agreement. Finally, liquor/spirits, under the belief \"Unique,\" also demonstrates growth from 10% to 36% repeated agreement. The overarching structure highlights how repeated exposure or experience with a brand can positively influence consumer perception, often more than initial impressions, across diverse industries.\n\n*Data source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, University of South Australia.*\n\n*Note: Repeat rates are typically low.

Not surprisingly, whether or not we recall a belief is highly dependent on the situation, and is very much affected by the cues that are used to elicit the belief, and can change depending on what other things were going through our head at the time. [^51]\n\nOur brand buying behaviour is like this: I might choose Avis 60% of the time, but that doesn’t mean that sometimes I won’t choose Hertz (indeed it suggests that I definitely will sometimes choose Hertz) even two or three times in a row. This behaviour appears to be random, even though each time I buy Avis or Hertz there are particular reasons for this. But those reasons are so variable that anyone watching my choices from a distance might think I was merely tossing a coin to make my choice (a coin that just happened to be weighted 60% in favour of Avis).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0W-W.png\" alt=\"Illustration of a blue owl sitting on a branch\" />\n</p>\n\nSo perhaps our attitudes merely reflect our buying. Our behaviour has a strong effect on our attitudes. But also, the fickle nature of our intentions (or their recall) is one of the many causes of our probabilistic buying patterns. Presumably attitudes play a role, albeit a small one, in the weighting of that mental coin.\n\nThe key discovery is that most of what we think about brands is not absolute. It is natural to tick the survey box that says we are completely satisfied with the brand and one hour later tick the ‘only somewhat satisfied’ box. Indeed, most of what we think about brands is so trivial, so barely thought through, that we will happily change our mind in a second. [^52] Actually, it’s misleading for me to talk about changing of minds. It’s more apt to say that we haven’t completely made up our minds yet. Or rather that we have made up our minds to sometimes think/like/buy the brand.",

But it can exist; for example, the Apple computer on which this book is being typed is rather dear to me personally.\n\nWhich leads us to question whether it is possible for a brand to build exceptional emotional or symbolically based loyalty. How important to a brand are these special, committed customers? Have some brands excelled at building passionate user bases?\n\n# Brand fanatics\n\nIt’s long been fashionable in marketing to uphold brand fanatics as ideal customers. While most buyers who are 100% loyal to a brand are simply light category buyers, there are a (very) few customers who both regularly buy from the category and yet are very loyal to one brand. There are also a few buyers who claim to be passionate about a brand. How important are these people? Who are they? How does a brand attract more passionate consumers?\n\nDon Gorske is a perfect example. This Wisconsin resident has consumed more than 23,000 Big Macs; he claims that the Big Mac constitutes more than 90% of his solid food intake. We know that he’s eaten more than 23,000 Big Macs because he records the ongoing total in a notebook. This apparently is just one example of his obsessive behaviour. Don Gorske, to put it mildly, is a little odd.[^53] Every brand has a few very loyal and heavy buyers, a few passionate advocates.",

Yet when I looked the list still includes prosaic brands such as 7-Eleven.

And the fact that Harley-Davidson riders are more likely to have tattoos of any sort than the average breakfast cereal buyer (i.e. a statistical selection effect). And that first purchases of motorbikes and tattoos tend to coincide, whereas consumers tend to be first introduced to Cornflakes at an age when their mum won’t allow them to get a tattoo, even if they wanted one!\n\nWhat are the buying facts about Apple and Harley-Davidson loyalty? First, just like other brands, their customers are polygamously loyal to a number of brands. The Harley-Davidson’s share of category requirements (SCR) metric is reported at about 33%. In other words, Harley-Davidson buyers purchase other bikes twice as often as they buy Harleys. This is a very normal sort of loyalty figure for a brand. Similarly, Apple’s repeat-buying level is much lower than 100% and is not very different from its competitors; see Table 7.5.\n\n**Table 7.5:** Apple owners show only moderately higher than expected loyalty\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of brand repeat purchase percentages, highlighting customer loyalty across different manufacturers. Dell leads with the highest repeat purchase rate at 71%, indicating strong customer retention. Apple follows with a repeat rate of 55%, demonstrating a significant level of customer loyalty. HP/Compaq is positioned third, with a repeat purchase percentage of 52%. The structure is a simple ranking, illustrating a direct comparison of a single metric—repeat purchase percentage—across three distinct brands. This suggests a hierarchy of customer loyalty, with Dell at the apex, followed by Apple, and then HP/Compaq. Given what we know about the double jeopardy law (see Chapter 2), Apple’s repeat-buying level is slightly high; that is, more Apple owners make their next purchase an Apple computer than we would expect, given Apple’s market share.\n\nA realistic explanation for this loyalty is that Apple owners would have to swap operating systems, and perhaps replace software, if they switch away from Apple. In comparison, a Gateway owner can switch to HP or Dell (or many dozens of other brands) and use the same operating system and software.",

I liked it because it was from a period where Apple was most certainly not a mass market brand and reports of its stellar loyalty were common, but like many people I wondered if anything had changed. Also, it’s never good to rely on a single set of data (even if it does fit well-established patterns). So with Katherine Anderson I undertook a simple survey asking people what brand of computer they currently had, and what was the brand of their previous computer. Katherine is an expert on the validity of on-line panels for different sorts of questions. We wondered if computer usage might vary between on-line panels; it’s quite reasonable to expect that online panels would skew to heavier computer users (this shows up in things like their Facebook usage). Then again this is complicated by the fact that panel providers may take deliberate steps to reduce this bias, and different providers may differ in their success in doing this. So we commissioned the data collection from three different online panels, each now reported separately.\n\nThe results from all three surveys, using the three different US online panel providers, each show the same double jeopardy pattern as the original MetaFacts data ten years earlier.

The implication is that they don’t compete with other brands of motorbike (like Triumph, Ducati, BSA and many others). Their marketing emphasis is on encouraging owners to feel that they are members of the tribe. They spend only 15% on traditional media, “The rest is spent on riding with customers and trying to create ‘epic’ experiences like the big bike party in Rome.” Harley invites its freedom-loving customers to share their own stories via the Fan Machine app on the company’s Facebook page, where it has nearly 4.7 million ‘fans’. It then casts real riders, found among its 133,000 Twitter followers, in the ads.\n\nYet a segmentation analysis of US Harley-Davidson riders (Swinyard 1995) shows that the largest segment (40% of owners) receive little psychological satisfaction from riding, nor are they tribe members or ever likely to be.\n\nMore than the other owners of Harleys, people in this segment agree with statements such as:\n\n* *most of the time my motorcycle is just parked*\n* *I like wearing a helmet when riding*\n* *I don’t know many other people that ride motorcycles.*\n\nThese Harley riders are also least likely to agree that, **“My bike is everything to me”**. Yet this group represents almost 50% of Harley-Davidson’s sales revenue.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, stereotypically fanatical Harley bikers earn the least but spend the most money each year on accessories for their bike. They are also the Harley owners most likely to like tattoos and drink beer; and the least likely to read a book. These people represent less than 10% of Harley owners and they are the least likely to have bought their bike new, so they represent a mere 3.5% of Harley-Davidson’s sales revenue.\n\nThe ‘Hog Heaven’ segment is the other owner group that might be classified as passionate brand loyalists; they disagree with statements like “I like bikes with plastic farings and engine covers”, and are most likely to agree with “When I’m on my bike people seem to be admiring me”. While many Harley owners in this segment are well paid, they spend the least on accessories for their bike and buy the smallest models.

      "content": "# How To Grow Your Customer Base\n\nByron Sharp\n\n----\n\n## What happens when brands grow or decline?\n\nThe double jeopardy law tells us that when brands improve their market share their buyer base enlarges. This growth in customer numbers could be due to improvements in customer acquisition, but it could also be the result of reduced customer defection. It’s a fact of marketing life that each year you lose buyers. If a brand can improve its retention levels then it should grow its customer base.\n\nSo in theory it’s possible to grow your customer base by improving either retention or acquisition, or a combination of both. We’d expect that making customers more satisfied might bring about both, especially retention. There is now a large body of literature based on this assumption – in fact one could say that the marketing literature for more than a decade has championed retention management.\n\nThis raises the strategic question of whether marketers should emphasise retention or acquisition. Modern marketing ideology says retention is cheaper than acquisition. But is it? And what returns are possible? How much emphasis should be placed on retention versus acquisition?\n\n## Is retention cheaper?\n\nA widely read Harvard Business Review article by Reichheld and Sasser (1990) states that customer defections can have a “surprisingly powerful impact on the bottom line … companies can boost profits by almost 100% by retaining just 5% more of their customers”. This is a surprising, fantastic claim, and it turns out to be just that – pure fantasy.\n\nIt’s reasonably presumed that this claim is based on empirical research, but Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) statement is merely based on a thought experiment; and it goes like this:\n\n> **Suppose a credit card company loses 10% of its customers each year, then the average customer life would be 10 years. Now if that firm were able to reduce its annual customer defection to 5% then the average customer tenure would double to 20 years. Given that a customer delivers some profits each year, now they stay for more years they must each give more.**\n\nThis is an analytical tautological ‘finding’, not a real-world discovery based on observing the results of retention efforts. It’s similar to saying that if you win the lottery then you will be richer: true by definition and hardly surprising.\n\nReichheld and Sasser (1990) presented their logic in a misleading manner because:",

Essentially all they revealed is that if a customer stays (i.e. buys) for longer, then they give you more money over this longer period.\n\nGiven that Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) article was about profitability we might expect that they would have included some assumptions about costs, and they did – they assumed that the halving of defection is achieved at zero cost!\n\nAnd finally they assumed that halving customer defection in the real world is perfectly possible. Indeed, why stop at half? Their article was titled “Zero defections …” Can companies radically alter their rate of customer defection? Is it possible to reduce defections to zero, or even to halve defections?

In reality, permanently reducing defection rates is difficult and expensive, because defection rates (another loyalty measure) also follow the double jeopardy law.\n\nThis means that a brand’s defection rate is essentially a function of its market share, and the category it’s in. This defection level does not vary substantially between competing brands.\n\nHow many customers a brand loses in a year depends on how many it has to lose in the first place. Obviously a brand can’t lose a million customers if it doesn’t have a million customers to start with. Larger brands therefore can, and do, lose more customers each year, and they also gain more customers. But as a proportion of their customer base they lose (and gain) less than smaller brands, i.e. their defection percentage is lower.",

One brand is smaller with 20% market share (a customer base of 200 customers); the other larger brand has 80% market share (a customer base of 800 customers). If the two brands maintain their respective share of customers, then each brand’s defections must equal its acquisitions. Imagine the large brand loses (and gains) 100 customers each year. Then, in this two-brand market, the small brand must also lose and gain 100 customers (see Figure 3.1). The small brand’s defection level is 50% (100 divided by 200) while the larger brand’s defection level is only 12.5% (100 divided by 800).\n\n**Figure 3.1:** The smaller the brand the higher the defection (and acquisition) metric\n\nThis data depicts a customer switching dynamic between a \"Big Brand\" and a \"Small Brand.\" The core relationship is a bidirectional customer flow, with \"100 customers switch each way\" indicating an equal number of customers moving from the Big Brand to the Small Brand and vice-versa. The structure highlights a comparative aspect, contrasting the customer base turnover rates. Specifically, the Small Brand experiences a higher proportion of its customer base switching away, implying a greater churn rate for the smaller entity compared to the larger one. This suggests a competitive landscape where the Small Brand, despite receiving customers from the Big Brand, struggles with customer retention.\n\n*Source: Sharp, Riebe, Dawes & Danenberg 2002 (Illustration by Dr Nick Danenberg).*\n\nIn real markets there are more than two brands so things are more complicated. But the fundamental pattern, the double jeopardy law, still holds with brands with a larger market share having slightly lower defection levels (i.e. higher loyalty).\n\nThe empirical reality of the double jeopardy law is a fatal blow to Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) idea of easily and cheaply halving customer defection.\n\nDouble jeopardy shows that it isn’t possible to radically alter defection rates without massively shifting market share.",

Defection levels for cars are much higher than in most service industries, though still surprisingly low considering the dozens of other new car brands that each buyer could have bought rather than staying loyal.

Consider Tables 3.1 and 3.2, each year a car brand gains about half its sales from new customers and about half from returning customers. If a brand like Toyota were to reduce its defection rate to zero then it would gain 50% more sales, which is one percentage point of market share. This one point of share is the maximum it can gain from improving retention. But each year about half of new car buyers switch brands, so each year 50 points of market share are up for grabs. This is the most Toyota can gain from improving acquisition, that is, 50 times the sales potential that retention offers!\n\nMost service industries have defection levels far lower than these examples. Figures of 3-5% are quite normal, so even if a company could miraculously reduce defection to zero it would give them a sales gain of only a few percentage points. In market after market the potential gains from acquisition dwarf the potential gains from reducing defection.\n\n# Even growing brands lose customers\n\nHalving defections is neither easy nor cheap, and permanently reducing customer defection to zero is fantasy. Also, the growth potential from customer acquisition is much higher.\n\nThe double jeopardy law describes normal markets where brands typically aren’t growing or declining substantially. What about dynamics? What role does defection play in delivering growth? Does defection reduce dramatically while a brand is growing? Does acquisition rise dramatically? Or, does growth come from a combination of both? Is growth dependent on marketing strategy? It turns out that the answer to these questions is very simple: growth is due to extraordinary acquisition. Contraction is due to dismal acquisition.",

      "content": "Erica Riebe (2003) examined the dynamics of customer base growth and contraction in her doctoral research. She examined both growing and declining pharmaceutical brands over 10 years.[18] For each brand she calculated the amount of acquisition and defection it should have had given the market norm and the size of the brand (i.e. if a brand’s customer base was stable then its acquisition and defection levels should be equal, and will depend on the size of the brand). She expected that growing brands might show excess acquisition and lower-than-expected defection. That is, together these two factors would contribute to the growth in the customer base. Surprisingly, she found that growth was almost entirely due to particularly high acquisition. The declining brands showed a similar pattern but in reverse: their defection rates were healthy and matched stable brands of similar market share, but their acquisition rates were poor.\n\nRiebe (2003) replicated this research in France (looking at shampoo and chocolate bars). Using twelve months of panel data she compared each panel member’s favourite brand in the first six months with his or her favourite in the second six months. This allowed Riebe to calculate, for each brand, how many ‘first brand loyals’ it gained and lost. The shampoo category turned out to be too stable, with the customer bases of the brands not changing. But in the chocolate category, where there was some movement, the same pattern was seen as in pharmaceuticals – customer base growth was mostly due to excelling in acquisition.\n\nThis research was later extended with further analysis and Nielsen provided four-and-a-half years of banking data. Again, it was good customer acquisition that led to growth, and poor acquisition that caused decline (Riebe et al. 2014).\n\n# Is defection largely outside of marketer control?\n\nA simple explanation for the pattern described above is that customer defection is largely outside of marketer control – at least in terms of being able to alter it with customer service and other such initiatives. There is some very good evidence to support this. Consider the following data (Table 3.3) on annual defection rates from financial institutions in Australia. This data shows a very typical double jeopardy pattern: loyalty declines with market share. In comparison to the huge variation in market shares (a thirtyfold difference between Adelaide Bank and CBA), defection rates vary little.\n\n**Table 3.3:** Defection rates (Australian financial institutions)",

The structure is a direct comparison of individual entities against two key metrics. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) exhibits the highest market share at 32%, with a relatively low defection rate of 3%. In contrast, Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and State Government Insurance Office (STG) show progressively lower market shares, ranging from 13% down to 6%, with defection rates between 4% and 5%. Smaller institutions like BankSA and Adelaide Bank have the lowest market shares at 1%, but notably higher defection rates of 5% and 7% respectively, indicating a potential inverse relationship between size and customer loyalty among the smaller players.\n\n*Source: Roy Morgan Research.*\n\nThe smallest brand, Adelaide Bank, is a regional bank with branches essentially only in Adelaide. CBA, the largest bank by a considerable margin, is thoroughly national with branches in every main city and regional centre. If someone moves from Adelaide to Sydney (about 20% of Australians move house each year) and if they banked with Adelaide Bank they now find themselves a very long way from the nearest Adelaide Bank branch. Hence, they are likely to switch to another bank, one with branches convenient to their new Sydney home. But if they had previously banked with CBA in Adelaide, odds are that they will have Sydney branches that are just as convenient as ever.\n\nThese differences in physical distribution seem to almost entirely explain the double jeopardy pattern in bank defection rates. So Adelaide Bank’s comparatively high defection level (double CBA’s) is probably nothing to do with differences in customer satisfaction, brand equity, nor any indicator of CBA having a superior retention program. It’s simply that Adelaide Bank is smaller than CBA and has fewer branches, so it must have more defection. Therefore, Adelaide Bank should not worry about its higher defection rate; there is practically nothing that can be done about it unless Adelaide Bank dramatically increases its market share<sup>19</sup>.\n\nResearch examining the reasons for customer defection (Bogomolova & Romaniuk 2005, 2009; Lees, Garland & Wright 2007; Bogomolova 2010, East et al 2012) has shown that much defection occurs for reasons entirely beyond the firm’s control (e.g.",

All the global market research agencies claim to provide an exclusive service that can tell if your brand is heading up or down. Every strategy consultancy says that only it can take you on the path to profitable share growth. Econometric modellers say they can quantify precisely which marketing mix will deliver maximum growth. This is all nonsense. If growth were that easy then all marketing directors would be out of a job, or paid a pittance of their current salary. No one can guarantee growth.  \nThat said, this book does reveal a great deal about how brands grow. Marketing science has been chipping away at the problem for decades. There have already been some breakthroughs that every professional marketing person should know about.\n\n## The desire for growth\n\nHave you ever met a marketer who was not interested in sales growth or, at the very least, interested in preventing losses? Growth is an ingrained part of our business culture. Marketing departments are expected to plan for and deliver growth. Marketing initiatives have to be justified in terms of growth potential. The main reason for this obsession with growth is the substantial fixed costs of most firms; this means that companies experience dramatic increases in profitability if they increase sales, and profits can be wiped out by comparatively small sales losses. So growth is very attractive.  \nHowever, market share growth is difficult. Markets are more competitive than ever. Marketers have to work very hard just to retain their current market share position; run very fast just to stand still. For example, the scope for price promotions to deliver any more growth is limited by the fact that we are running about as many promotions as the retail system can handle.\n\nThere is plenty to debate about whether an obsession with sales growth is good for profits in the long run, but let’s accept the idea that it would be good to know more about how to deliver market share growth and prevent decline.\n\n# The difference between large and small brands",

A million brands have attempted to grow – some have been successful and some not. Can we use these trillions of dollars worth of natural experiments to discover something universal about the differences between large and small brands? Yes; the difference between large and small brands, and growing and declining brands, is very revealing.\n\nAgain and again it appears in numerous product categories, markets and countries that there is a fundamental law of brand size:¹¹ big brands have markedly larger customer bases.  \nThis seems obvious – more sales equals more customers – yet it need not be this way. A brand’s sales volume depends on two things:  \n* how many buyers it has  \n* how often they buy the brand.\n\nOne multiplied by the other equals sales. So a brand could be large because it is bought very often by its buyers, without having many buyers. Theoretically there could be two brands of equal size, one with many buyers who buy the brand occasionally, while the other brand has half the number of buyers but they buy it twice as often.¹² See Table 2.1 for an illustration of this point.\n\n**Table 2.1:** Different metrics that can result in equal sales volumes and shares\n\nThis data illustrates a comparative analysis of two hypothetical brands, Dell-icious and AppleCore, both of equal size, to determine their resulting market share. The comparison focuses on two key metrics: annual market penetration, representing the percentage of the market that purchases from the brand annually, and the number of purchases made per buyer per annum. Dell-icious exhibits a higher annual market penetration at 32% but a lower number of purchases per buyer per annum (3), leading to a market share of 14%. Conversely, AppleCore has a lower annual market penetration of 16% but a higher number of purchases per buyer per annum (6), also resulting in a market share of 14%. This demonstrates that different combinations of market penetration and purchase frequency can yield identical market shares.\n\nBut this happens only in theory, never in practice. In the real world, two brands of about equal market share have around equal market penetration, and so they must also get bought by their buyers at a similar average rate.",

Put another way: *loyalty doesn’t vary much.* This is not what traditional (or fashionable) marketing literature implies.\n\nWe’ve all been taught that brands vary tremendously in loyalty, with brands like Apple held up as loyalty champions. We’ll investigate Apple’s loyalty levels further in Chapter 7 but for now let’s just look at the discovery that loyalty metrics for competing brands are quite similar.\n\n# Loyalty doesn’t vary much\n\nIf you look at marketing metrics (i.e. from consumer panels[^14] run by global market research agencies such as Nielsen and Kantar) you’ll see that the bigger brands have much higher penetrations and they also get bought slightly more often by their buyers – but not much more.\n\nTable 2.2 deconstructs the market shares of major washing machine detergent brands. You can see that all brands are bought by their buyers slightly less often than four times a year. The largest brand, Persil, gets bought almost four times a year. Surf, the smallest, has fewer than half the number of buyers as Persil and these buyers buy Surf around three and a half times a year. This pattern is known as the ‘double jeopardy’ law because smaller brands get ‘hit twice’: their sales are lower because they have fewer buyers who buy the brand less often.\n\n**Table 2.2:** Double Jeopardy Law – washing powder, UK 2005\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of leading washing powder brands in the UK market as of 2005, illustrating their competitive landscape under the \"Double Jeopardy Law\" framework. The table details five brands: Persil, Ariel, Bold, Daz, and Surf, alongside their respective market share percentages. It also quantifies their annual market penetration, indicating the proportion of households purchasing each brand within a year. Furthermore, the data provides the average purchase frequency for each brand, offering insight into consumer loyalty and repeat purchasing behavior. Persil leads significantly in market share, followed by Ariel, with the remaining brands holding smaller but still notable positions. The purchase frequencies show a general trend of higher frequency for brands with larger market shares, though minor variations exist.\n\n*Note: Each brand’s customers buy the brand at similar purchase rates.*  \n*Source: Kantar WorldPanel.*",

This table is interesting because both the market leader (PG’s Head & Shoulders) and the smallest brand (Wella’s Vosene) are functionally different from the other brands – they are formulated to reduce dandruff. However, this does not substantively affect the double jeopardy law. All the brands get purchased about two times, with the market leaders being purchased slightly more often.\n\n**Table 2.3:** Double Jeopardy Law – shampoo UK\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of shampoo brands in the UK market as of 2010, illustrating the \"Double Jeopardy Law\" principle. The table details market share, annual market penetration, and average purchase frequency for several brands, including Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Dove, L’Oreal Elvive, Sunsilk, and Vosene. Head & Shoulders leads with the highest market share (11%) and penetration (23%), while also exhibiting a relatively high purchase frequency (1.9). Conversely, brands with lower market shares, such as L’Oreal Elvive, Sunsilk, and Vosene, generally show lower penetration rates and purchase frequencies. The data suggests a correlation where leading brands command larger market shares and higher customer engagement, while smaller brands struggle to achieve comparable penetration and repeat purchase rates, with an overall average purchase frequency of 1.7 across the analyzed brands.\n\n*Note: Smaller UK shampoo brands suffer from only slightly lower loyalty.*  \n*Source: Kantar Worldpanel.*\n\nIn 2010, Head & Shoulders was bought by more than four times as many buyers as bought Vosene. This much larger customer base largely explains why Head & Shoulders had five times the sales of Vosene. Another small contributing factor is that buyers of Head & Shoulders were more loyal, buying it 0.3 times more often per annum.\n\nData from Nielsen shows that the US shampoo category exhibits the same pattern. Different brands, different market shares, different consumers, different time period, different consumer panel and analysts – but the same familiar double jeopardy pattern. Later we’ll discuss why this occurs and what the loyalty implications are, but for now let’s continue to focus on the implications of this scientific law for brand growth.\n\n**Table 2.4:** Double Jeopardy Law – shampoo US",

It details market share, annual market penetration, and average purchase frequency for several brands, including Suave Naturals, Pantene Pro-V, Alberto V05, Garnier Fructis, Dove, and Finesse. The data shows a general trend where brands with higher market share, such as Suave Naturals (12%) and Pantene Pro-V (10%), also exhibit higher annual market penetration (19% and 16%, respectively) and purchase frequencies (2 and 1.9). Conversely, brands with lower market share, like Finesse (1%), have correspondingly lower penetration (2%) and purchase frequency (1.4). The overall average purchase frequency across these brands is 1.7. This structure highlights a relationship where leading brands tend to be purchased more frequently, supporting the Double Jeopardy Law's assertion that larger brands are more likely to be bought more often.\n\n*Note: Smaller US shampoo brands suffer from only slightly lower loyalty.*  \n*Source: Nielsen.*\n\nSnapshots of market share shifts over time (in the US, Canada and UK) also show double jeopardy: brands grow primarily by increasing their market penetration (Anschuetz 2002; Baldinger, Blair & Echambadi, 2002; Stern & Ehrenberg 2003). Shorter-term dynamic analysis by Andrew Ehrenberg and Colin McDonald (2003) showed that in 157 cases of small annual market share change the double jeopardy law was clear: both rising and declining brands displayed more change in their penetration than in their purchase frequency.\n\nAmong the submissions for the Advertising Effectiveness Awards – run by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) – 82% reported large penetration growth, 6% reported both penetration and loyalty growth, and only 2% reported loyalty growth alone.\n\nDouble Jeopardy was first observed in attitudes back in the 1960s, then later in behaviour like choosing which newspaper to read, voting, or store choice. Since then it has been observed everywhere from soap to soap operas - although it is still not well known about. It has been observed for industrial brands, luxury brands, services, stores, store chains, comic strips, newspapers, radio stations, TV networks, TV programs, politicians, and so on. Double Jeopardy has been documented in numerous countries, and local regional markets within them.

As market penetration decreases among suppliers B through G, the average number of purchases also generally declines. Suppliers B, C, and D show moderate market penetration (36% to 31%) with average purchases ranging from 1.54 to 1.27.

If Finesse (in Table 2.4) were to catapult up to the sales level of Suave Naturals or Pantene, it would be substantially more popular with millions more households buying it each year. But these households would not, on average, buy it much more often than current Finesse households buy the brand.\n\nFinesse’s brand manager could plan to reach market leadership by getting current customers to buy eight times a year. That would be enough to do it – in theory. But in practice that is impossible. Finesse-buying households currently only buy shampoo six times a year; therefore Finesse would need to command 100% loyalty just to achieve six purchases per year per customer.\n\nBut no shampoo brand in the US is bought six times a year and no shampoo brand commands 100% loyalty. Such a marketing plan is fantasy. Double jeopardy tells us what is, and what isn’t achievable.",

In the same way that laws of physics constrain the creativity of architects in a good way (they wish to design buildings that stand up to gravity, wind and rain), the double jeopardy law simply provides a practical guide to strategy formulation.\n\n# What about new uses – growing the category?\n\nMost of us learned at university that one avenue for sales growth is to show buyers new uses for our product. In an industrial setting, sales people certainly spend time doing this, helping teach clients how to fully use complicated products and services. But what about consumer markets where personal tuition is not affordable? Can a weak force like advertising teach buyers about new, non-obvious, uses for the product?\n\nAs a university student I was taught the Arm & Hammer case study. Arm & Hammer is an American brand of sodium bi-carbonate (baking soda), little known outside of the US; Church & Dwight, the company that markets it, controls 75% of the sodium bi-carbonate production in the US. Bi-carb of soda is used by consumers primarily as a raising agent in baking (or for kids to make volcano-type science experiments). The case study said that Arm & Hammer generated sales growth by telling consumers they could use their baking soda for things like absorbing bad smells in the fridge or exfoliating your skin. Arm & Hammer still today tell people about these uses (at least on their web site).\n\nThe Arm & Hammer case study was already an old example back when I was an undergraduate, yet I still hear it used, which is suspicious. Perhaps it’s the only successful case? McDonald’s teaching the market to think of them for breakfast is perhaps a more verifiable and current example. Though in this case the ‘new use’ was far from radical and easy to communicate.\n\nIt would seem logically possible for a brand to point out new uses for the category (e.g. salt helps with red wine stains), and this might stimulate growth – though for all brands in the category. However, things that are logically possible can, in the real world, turn out to be practically extremely difficult or unlikely.",

      "content": "In this case there are a number of growth impediments. First, it’s hard to get people to change their habits. Consider that dentists have been telling people to brush their teeth at least twice a day but the average is stubbornly stuck at less than two, with the most common being once a day.\n\nUnilever tried to tell men to spray the body deodorant Axe all over (as a perfume in effect) but it failed to drive usage – people know you spray deodorant under arms, and habits are hard to change. Second, it’s hard to build non-obvious mental structures, for example, if people think of your brand as a baking product then it’s hard for them to think of it as a fridge deodorant. Hands up all of you who have a box of bi-carbonate soda in your fridge absorbing stray smells – I’m guessing not many of you. And, third, few brands have sufficient advertising budgets to change how the population thinks about a product category. Advertising works best when it tells us things we already believe. It’s strongest at refreshing existing memory structures, not building new, non-obvious ones. Categories do grow, and shrink, over time; and consumers, do find uses for products that even their manufacturers didn’t think of. But these changes are seldom driven by advertising, perhaps nudged along a bit, but seldom driven.\n\nFor a single brand, with its small ad budget, to change people’s category habits seems very difficult. Certainly not without making changes to physical availability, for example, Arm & Hammer being stocked in the cleaning or cosmetic sections of supermarkets.\n\nI wonder how successful Arm & Hammer was at increasing usage of baking soda. Certainly some people were using it for more than baking before they started promoting it that way (this was probably Arm & Hammer’s inspiration). I suspect that their gains were rather modest. Interestingly, Arm & Hammer have, over the years, entered new product categories, like cleaning products and toothpaste, with bicarbonate soda based formulations. Perhaps the real story here is that they found that they couldn’t change people’s habits to use that box of baking soda in different ways, so instead of trying to change people they brought the soda to the traditional products people used.",

      "content": "In short, the aim of growing category purchases through presenting new uses often turns out to be a pipe-dream. That’s why marketers who want to increase sales need to win more market share and/or enter new markets.\n\n# Penetration the winning target One sound principle that is taught at business school is that you are far more likely to succeed if you have the right goal.\n\nA meta-analysis of 207 US split-cable advertising weight tests concluded that only one of the measured strategy variables was correlated with larger sales effects – i.e. having the objective of increasing penetration (Lodish et al. 1995 p.130).\n\nWhile an analysis (Binet & Field 2007) of 880 entries to the IPA’s Effectiveness Awards showed that winners were far more likely to have set targets to increase market penetration. Each entrant stated their primary business purpose: for 178 entrants, this was ‘customer retention/increase loyalty’, while for 79 entrants it was ‘new customer acquisition/penetration’. Here’s how the awards played out:\n\n**Table 2.6:** Analysis of the IPA’s Effectiveness Awards\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of customer engagement, specifically focusing on \"Penetration\" and \"Loyalty,\" across different customer segments categorized by their award status: \"Gold winners,\" \"Silver winners,\" \"Bronze winners,\" and \"No medal.\" The structure highlights how these award tiers correlate with the percentage of customers exhibiting penetration and loyalty behaviors. Notably, \"Gold winners\" show the highest penetration at 21% and a modest 2% loyalty, while \"Silver winners\" exhibit 20% penetration and 6% loyalty. \"Bronze winners\" have 18% penetration and 3% loyalty. Conversely, the \"No medal\" segment, representing the largest customer group at 41% penetration, demonstrates a significantly higher loyalty rate of 89%. The data concludes with a total of 100% for both penetration and loyalty, indicating these represent the complete customer base within each category.\n\n*Source: Binet & Field 2007.*\n\nCampaigns that, unfashionably, aimed to increase penetration were more than twice as likely to report very large improvements in all hard measures of effectiveness including sales and profits. This pattern was strongest for durables and services. Yet only half the number of submissions aimed to increase penetration as aimed for loyalty/retention improvements or to change attitudes. Therefore, marketers are using the wrong targets.",

      "content": "UPDATE: Since the first version of “How Brands Grow” was published, Binet & Field have updated their analysis in a 2013 IPA report titled “The Long & the Short of It: balancing short and long term marketing strategies”. This time with a larger database covering 30 years of marketing campaigns, and 996 campaigns, they again report “across the board, campaigns targeting new customers outperform campaigns targeting existing customers. In terms of the average number of business effects reported, the former are three times as effective as those targeting existing customers” (p.24).\n\nLes Binet confided to me that he once wrote an effectiveness awards submission where he and his client aimed to increase penetration in the north and loyalty in the south. Annoyingly, while loyalty did improve in the south, penetration there improved even more. Try as one might, if you are successful in gaining sales it’s unlikely you’ll break the double jeopardy law.\n\nAnd the IPA Effectiveness Awards results remind us that it is a much better strategy to go with the law than against it. Jim Nyce, previously Insights Director at Kraft, describes this as ‘swimming downstream’. An analysis (led by Frank Cotignola) by his Consumer Insight & Strategy department showed that 56% of their brand plans were trying to ‘swim upstream’ by raising purchase frequency, while an internal study of the growth and decline patterns of 67 Kraft brands showed that penetration was the dominant driver of sales and share, in line with the double jeopardy law.\n\n# What about niche brands?\n\nThe term ‘niche’ is used loosely in marketing; often it is used simply to mean small.[15] This turns out to be appropriate because most niche brands are small. Technically, a niche brand in a category should, for its market share, have an unusually small base of buyers who are unusually loyal.[16] If every category had a number of these brands, and/or their differences truly were substantial then the double jeopardy pattern wouldn’t exist. There are far fewer niche brands than people expect, and they are less niche than we think.",

      "content": "Nor is being niche necessarily a good thing. Rather than thinking of niche brands as having excess loyalty more are best thought of as having less penetration (and market share) than we’d expect given their loyalty levels. This penetration deficit is usually due to some lack of availability, such as being missing from a particular distribution channel (e.g. retail private labels are completely missing from rival store chains), or missing in a particular geographical area. This penetration deficit may also be due to lack of mental availability amongst part of the buying population, for instance, because of their lack of advertising some private labels are simply not thought of or noticed by some customers – more people than expected given their market share. Similarly differentiated brands may be rejected by part of the buying population while the rest value the differentiation – Spanish language TV channels in the US are an example. They are not watched by those who don’t speak Spanish but watched for many hours by those that do. Whatever the reason a brand’s lack of penetration is rarely something to boast about.\n\n# What about cross-selling?\n\nAnother route to sales growth is to encourage current customers to buy different products. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems and loyalty programs often promise this benefit. It’s widely viewed that this is an easy path to growth: that is, you already have a relationship with these buyers, so if they are made a good offer they should take it up.\n\nYet many large corporations make good offers to their own employees and are disappointed by the response rate. If selling new products to your own employees is difficult, then cross-selling to existing customers might not be so easy after all.\n\nCross-selling metrics are another measurement of loyalty, so once again we find the double jeopardy law applies. There is very little difference in cross-selling metrics between competing brands, and the small differences that do exist tend to reflect market share – not whether or not they have dedicated cross-selling programs.\n\nTables 2.7 and 2.8 provide data on cross-selling metrics for insurance and banking, respectively.\n\n**Table 2.7:** Cross-selling metrics for insurance",

So their deficient cross-selling metric is actually due to their unusual success in one part of the market. In other words, we see no evidence of excellence in cross-selling, though we do see some brands excelling at selling a particular product to *additional* customers.\n\nIn both categories there is very little difference between brands in cross-sell metrics. Every insurance brand has a customer base that, on average, buys one and a half services from them; each banking brand’s customers buy two services.\n\nThere are dubious case studies of firms that have achieved cross-selling success. One of the problems is that the metric ‘numbers of products’ is open to manipulation. For example, you must have a separate EFTPOS card even though the credit card we gave you can already access your savings account, oh and we’ve added a small overdraft to your savings account – voila the count of ‘products per customer’ goes up. When managers are set targets to increase ‘number of products’ per customer there is a strong incentive to be inventive and manipulate the loyalty metric. Wells Fargo is the market leader in retail banking in the US, it also claims to be the leader in cross-selling. It says it has reached six products per household (out of a potential of 16). Of course, double jeopardy says Wells Fargo has to have the highest loyalty metrics because of its market share. We also know that the difference between brands is unlikely to be great, and this appears to be the case. The Wall Street Journal (Smith 2011) reports that financial analysts are doubtful about Wells Fargo’s claims: “It’s always been a bone of contention, one of those things that Wall Street tended to view with a jaundiced eye,” says bank analyst Nancy Bush of NAB Research LLC in Annandale, New Jersey. “If I have a checking account and get a debit card, that’s two products which another bank might only count as one”, she added. Unsurprisingly, other banks have disputed Well Fargo’s claim of leadership saying that their own cross-sell metrics are just as good.",

      "content": "None of this says that cross-selling is impossible, but it does imply that it’s nowhere near as easy as textbooks make out, and certainly not a route to huge sales gains. The lack of difference among the brands shown in Tables 2.6 and 2.7 suggests that dramatically changing cross-selling metrics is difficult and expensive (some brands have tried, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at their results).\n\nOne reason it is harder than expected to cross-sell products to existing buyers is that those who haven’t bought these products from you don’t need them; for example, you can’t sell car insurance to someone who drives a company car. Another neglected reason is that service brands often already enjoy high loyalty; for example, most of your customers who needed a home loan came to you already (and you either gave them one or turned them down). So improving this already high loyalty is difficult.\n\n# And profits?\n\nIt’s often naively hoped that investing in current customers might yield greater net returns than seeking to expand the customer base. The simplest idea is to spend the most on heaviest customers and the least on the lightest. It assumes that heavy customers (i.e. those that buy more of the brand) are the best candidates for investment. I call this the ‘Heavy Buyer Fallacy’ because the misguided logic confuses past/current buying with growth potential – when it’s more reasonable to think that heavy customers are already buying all that they ever will. It seems logical that a firm can afford to spend more on a heavy customer than a light one; certainly direct marketing managers find it easier to justify sending expensive letters to heavier customers, and very hard to justify spending several dollars on customers who deliver less than this in sales revenue. However the key issue is what this marketing expenditure will return (What change will it evoke?), so even customers who are currently worth nothing may be worth marketing to in order to win their future custom.",

Rienartz & Kumar (2000, 2002) investigated profitability and tenure using data from a US catalogue retailer, a French retail food business, and a German direct brokerage, and found that a customer’s tenure did a surprisingly poor job of predicting their lifetime profitability, because even short-term customers could generate a good deal of profit. Their cohort analysis partly explains this by showing that customers did not become more profitable over time, nor did long tenure clients pay higher prices. In industrial settings this may due to long-standing customers extracting better terms and discounts. In consumer settings long-standing customers may learn to pick the very best value items from a firm’s portfolio, or learn when price discounts are offered.\n\n# Further reading on the double jeopardy law Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, hence the many data sets in this chapter.\n\nThose interested in delving deeper, or simply seeing the wide range of conditions under which the double jeopardy law has been documented (e.g. attitudes, behaviour, industrial, services, durables, retail, voting, media) may wish to read the following peer-reviewed journal articles:\n\nBennett, Dag & Graham, Charles 2010. ‘Is loyalty driving growth for the brand in front?

While it is commonplace to talk about building strong brands (rather than short-run sales), brand managers have little specialist knowledge about building and managing these assets, and rarely if ever do they have comprehensive metrics covering mental and physical availability. Their efforts are seldom judged against such metrics. Considerable time is wasted on esoteric quackery concerned with segmentation, differentiation and how buyers perceive brands (e.g. brand personality).\n\nHowever, as more brand managers realise how brands really compete, their attention should turn towards activities that build mental and physical availability. Their attention will then shift to branding, media strategy and distribution – there is a great deal of research, development and experimentation that needs to be done in these areas to improve marketing effectiveness.\n\nMarketing today largely functions as a specialist part of the production department; it produces advertising and promotions rather than experimenting and learning about strategy. Development of specialist knowledge of these market-based assets should lead to greater respect for marketing as a crucial function of business. It is a significant opportunity because no other part of the organisation measures and therefore can claim to manage these intangible assets. The same cannot be said for other areas of a business, such as product development, customer service and pricing.\n\nThe future for marketing departments and for consumer brands is bright – if they adapt to the more complex and media-fragmented world we live in; if they become sophisticated mass marketers working with the empirical laws of marketing; and if they reject ‘anything goes’ lawless marketing strategy.\n\n# Chapter 13:  \n## The Scientific Laws\n\nByron Sharp One thing that emerges from the law-like patterns discussed in this book is that everything varies together.",

      "content": "## Why Loyalty Programs Don’t Work  \nByron Sharp\n\n----\n\nLoyalty programs are structured marketing efforts that reward, and therefore encourage, loyal buying behaviour. The most typical programs provide consumers with points each time they make purchases. Gradually, after many purchases, these points add up and reach a level where they may be redeemed for rewards. This points system is an incentive for consumers to purchase a particular brand more frequently (i.e. increase their loyalty) in order to gain more rewards faster. Such loyalty programs might also discourage defection from the brand as, once customers have accumulated points, and if they enjoy and value the loyalty program, they should be less likely to defect to another brand. At least that’s how the logic goes.\n\nHuge sums of money have been invested in loyalty programs over the past decade, be everyone from airlines to coffee shops. Some marketers implemented these programs because it was fashionable to do so, or launched programs because they now had the technology to do so. However, most marketers were motivated by the hope that loyalty programs would improve loyalty. They anticipated great business results, with large increases in sales and profit. 75\n\nHowever, as discussed in Chapter 1, marketing strategies that are based on false assumptions will never deliver high returns, no matter how well executed the strategies. The key assumptions that underpinned the large investments in loyalty programs are faulty. Many people assumed that loyalty levels could easily be dramatically improved; that customer defection could be reduced (to zero even); and that existing customers could be encouraged to devote all their purchasing to one brand (100% loyalty). It was assumed this would lead to substantial growth in revenue and profits. It was also mistakenly assumed that targeting a brand’s most loyal customers would generate the greatest return. Enthusiasm for loyalty programs has now waned, and some firms are winding down loyalty programs.\n\nThere is no evidence that outstanding business results are driven by loyalty programs, and in spite of thousands of programs strangely no-one is coming forward showing off their success.",

      "content": "Loyalty programs are still big business. One of the problems with large-scale consumer loyalty programs is that they are difficult for firms to exit from them. Consumers who have accumulated points do not take kindly to losing them. If consumers are told they are losing their points, they tend to place an unrealistic, inflated value on the points – even if they were unlikely to redeem them[^76]. There are also contractual and legal impediments to shutting down a loyalty program, and there are the considerable sunk costs (including management ego) invested in the program. Firms turn out to be quite loyal to their loyalty programs, and tend to continue them far longer than rational economics would recommend.\n\n# Do loyalty programs improve loyalty?\n\nDo loyalty programs affect loyalty? You may be surprised to hear that yes, they do. However, the effect is very weak. The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute published the first large-scale empirical study (see Sharp & Sharp, 1997a) that analysed one of the world’s largest (in terms of retail coverage) loyalty programs in Australia. The study observed a weak effect – an effect that may have been as much to do with the program launch, and its marketing spend, than the program itself.\n\nThe technical difficulty in evaluating the effect of loyalty programs on loyalty is to have a baseline to make comparisons from. Simply comparing the behaviour of loyalty program members to non-members is inappropriate because a brand’s more loyal customers will join the program (i.e. a selection effect that occurs because these shoppers have more to gain). Looking for changes in consumers’ behaviour from when the loyalty program was implemented is difficult, because this would require having data on long periods of continuous purchasing before and after the implementation of the program. A long period of data is required to correctly classify the loyalty level of individual consumers because their buying fluctuates. The law of buyer moderation (see Chapter 4) means that many members of loyalty programs will be misclassified as less loyal than they really are. Over time it will look as if these buyers are becoming more loyal and this ‘regression to the mean’ effect will be mistakenly attributed to the loyalty program. One analysis of a very small convenience store loyalty program suffered from this (Liu 2007).",

As the name suggests the loyalty program rewarded shoppers with points that could be redeemed for flights.  \nLoyalty programs should make brands look niche, that is, their market share should be made up of unusually high loyalty for their market share and penetration. This is because loyalty programs reach a restricted part of the customer base and encourage these consumers to buy more frequently.<sup>77</sup> So a loyalty program might or might not grow a brand’s share much but it should make that share be an unusual combination of penetration and loyalty. Or put another way, it probably won’t drive penetration but it may drive loyalty (which is not the usual way brands grow) Table 11.1 shows each brand in the FlyBuys loyalty program and the penetration and loyalty metrics necessary to make up its market share. By comparing the predicted and observed market share composition, we can see there does appear to be a loyalty effect. However, the effect is so weak that it is inconsistent; some brands don’t show the pattern presumably because other marketing mix factors swamp the weak effect.\n\n**Table 11.1:** The FlyBuys loyalty program",

The structure is hierarchical, categorizing by retail type (Department stores, Supermarkets, Retail petrol, Bank credit cards, Phone calls) and then by specific companies within those sectors. For each company, metrics are provided for Penetration (%), Average purchase frequency, Share of requirements (%), and Sole buyers (%), with both observed and predicted values. Notably, the Bank credit card sector in NZ shows particularly high observed loyalty metrics, with NAB and BNZ exhibiting substantial Share of requirements and Sole buyers, while the Phone calls sector (Telecom) also demonstrates very high penetration and loyalty. An overall average across all sectors is also presented, indicating a general trend of predicted values being slightly lower than observed for penetration and purchase frequency, but higher for sole buyers. **Source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute (see Sharp & Sharp 1997)**\n\nProfessors Lars Meyer-Waarden and Christophe Benavent (2006) replicated the Ehrenberg-Bass research using the AGB Behavior Scan panel in France. They examined the effect of four supermarket loyalty programs and they too observed weak and inconsistent effects. Leenheer and colleagues (2007) used a different approach (a one-off statistical model) to control selection effects (i.e. that the most loyal consumers join a brand’s loyalty program). Their study of Dutch supermarket loyalty programs also found very small loyalty effects. Another Dutch researcher (Verhoef 2003) found small, positive effects on retention and share in the financial services market; however, Verhoef acknowledged that the longitudinal design of his study didn’t fully account for the selection effects. It is a consistent story. Loyalty programs produce very slight loyalty effects, and do practically nothing to drive growth. The consequent effect on profits is presumably negative.\n\n# Why don’t loyalty programs work better?",

      "content": "The answer lies in the fact that from a marketing strategy perspective there is something unusual about loyalty programs: they skew, more than other marketing interventions, towards heavier, more loyal buyers of the brand. This selection effect occurs for two reasons. The first is physical and mental availability: it is easier for more loyal buyers to notice the loyalty program and to join. This is particularly true of retail loyalty programs where usually the only way of joining is to sign up in-store; more regular shoppers have a statistically (much) higher chance of joining due to chance exposure. The second reason is the economic incentive to join, which is much stronger for already loyal buyers who can see that they will be rewarded for doing what they already do – getting ‘something for nothing’ is an attractive deal.\n\nEssentially, consumers who rarely buy a brand (or shop in a particular store) don’t see the loyalty program – and if they do they can’t see the point in joining. This substantially restricts the reach of loyalty programs, and hence limits their capacity to drive substantial growth. There is also the question of what effect the loyalty program has on those consumers who it does reach (i.e. consumers who join the program and remember to participate). Logically, this effect will not only depend on the strength of the loyalty program, but also on which particular consumers the loyalty program recruits.\n\nTable 11.2 shows that there are four types of consumers a loyalty program can recruit and potentially influence (i.e. influence their loyalty towards the brand with the loyalty program).\n\n**Table 11.2:** Types of customers who could join the loyalty program\n\nThis table presents a two-by-two matrix categorizing consumers based on their purchase level (light or heavy) and their level of loyalty (low or high). The matrix illustrates the desirability and likelihood of these consumer segments joining a loyalty program. Consumers with a light purchase level and low loyalty are the largest group but are unlikely to join, making them not particularly desirable. Light purchasers with high loyalty are likely to join but are considered undesirable. Heavy purchasers with low loyalty are very unlikely to join but are highly desirable. Finally, heavy purchasers with high loyalty are likely to join but are also deemed undesirable. The structure is comparative, contrasting different consumer segments' characteristics in relation to loyalty program engagement.",

      "content": "Most consumers fall into the top left-hand quadrant because most buyers are lighter-than-average consumers (of products in a particular category) and most of a brand’s buyers also buy other brands. A loyalty program will inevitably recruit some of these light consumers because there are so many of them. Most will become lapsed users of the program as they generally fail to accumulate sufficient points to qualify for rewards and so gradually forget about, or reject, the program (e.g. they lose the loyalty card). Hopefully a few of these consumers will become heavier buyers.\n\nIf a loyalty program only recruits highly loyal buyers (right-hand quadrants) it has little chance of generating any change; first, these people don’t need to change their behaviour to win rewards, and second, they can’t change anyway as they are already very loyal. It is because of these consumers that a loyalty program can have negative effects: it gives away rewards but gains no change in behaviour in return.\n\nConsumers that fall into the lower left-hand are the most desirable consumers for a loyalty program to recruit. If a loyalty program reaches consumers who are heavy buyers of a category and who are not 100% loyal to a brand, then it is more likely to extract additional loyalty and sales. These heavy buyers have more loyalty to give; however, their motivation is not necessarily high as they will earn rewards anyway. What motivation they have is also easily countered by competitor loyalty programs and promotions. These heavy buyers are very aware of competitor offerings.\n\nWith this knowledge of the structure of the market, and the nature of loyalty programs, logic suggests that such programs have little chance of generating increased sales and profit.\n\nA loyalty program’s success depends on recruiting many consumers from the lower left-hand quadrant, which is unlikely. Ideally, from a cost perspective, a program needs to recruit as few consumers as possible who are already loyal to the brand (this, however, is probably impossible). What happens in the real world? As you have probably suspected, loyalty programs are good at recruiting existing buyers of a brand (both heavy and light category buyers) but lousy at recruiting heavy category buyers who are not current buyers of a brand.",

The table clearly shows that loyalty programs fail to attract a disproportionate number of heavier buyers.\n\n**Table 11.3:** Buying rates of members and non-members of a loyalty program\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of average purchase frequency across various retail categories for consumers who joined a program versus those who did not. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences in purchasing behavior based on program participation. For supermarkets, consumers who joined the program had an average purchase frequency of 27, while non-participants averaged 28. Retail fuel showed a similar pattern with frequencies of 13 and 14, respectively. Department stores and credit cards exhibited a slightly higher frequency among non-participants (10 vs. 9). Telecommunications displayed identical average purchase frequencies of 26 for both groups. A second entry for credit cards showed 9 for both participants and non-participants. Overall, the average purchase frequency across all listed categories was 15 for both consumers who joined the program and those who did not, indicating no significant difference at the aggregate level.\n\n*Source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.*\n\nIn spite of the discussion above, this discovery is a little surprising because heavier category buyers (both regular buyers of a brand and non-buyers) have much more to gain from a loyalty program. It makes sense to expect that loyalty program members would be heavier buyers (of a category).\n\nWhat this shows is that mental and physical availability is the dominant driver of recruitment to loyalty programs – ahead of the attractiveness of the rewards. Existing buyers of a brand join; that is, both heavy and light buyers of the category. This suggests that the best way to promote a loyalty program, and recruit members, is to avoid using a brand’s own stores, website or mailing list. Ideally, a brand would recruit members in its competitors’ stores! Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to overcome the inherent characteristics of a loyalty program – that it will skew towards existing buyers of the brand. This is why loyalty programs can’t have much effect. They essentially reward existing buyers for what they already do.\n\nLoyalty programs are not good at affecting loyalty. They are more suited to being used to build a database of consumers, creating a new channel to talk to consumers and a way of monitoring their buying in-store.",

But the effect does not last; it ends when the price discount ends. This is because price promotions largely reward customers who have bought the discounted brand in the past (and who are lucky enough to find it on sale). Price promotions do not alter underlying propensities to buy in the future; they lack reach and usually fail to bring new customers to a brand.\n\n## Introduction\n\nA book about the laws of marketing and buying behaviour would not be complete without discussing price. This chapter reveals the law-like patterns in how consumers react to price changes, particularly how temporary price discounts affect buying, sales and profits.\n\n## Price is not all-important\n\nPrice is a powerful variable in the marketing mix. It is arguably the easiest element of a product to change and it has the largest direct effect on sales. Price obviously matters to consumers, and is often thought to be the most important factor. Yet, brand leaders are almost never the cheapest. Not all buyers switch when a more expensive brand becomes cheaper. Therefore, price is not everything. So how do consumers react to price and to price changes and why do they behave as they do?\n\nThis chapter principally comments on what happens when the price of an established brand is changed temporarily, for example, in a price promotion. We will not be discussing the process of setting a price. However, it is important to bear in mind that each brand has a ‘normal’ price that reflects the quality of the brand (with some variation for how much is available (supply) and mental & physical availability (demand).",

Consumers are aware of this tier system, so considering context is important when evaluating the prices people are willing to pay. It is apparent that consumers will pay for quality: the prices for higher quality brands are higher than the prices for lower quality brands, and the higher quality brands do well year after year. We also see that, generally, the very best brands are considerably more expensive, and the very cheapest brands are often considerably lower quality – if you really want quality, you have to pay for it, and if you want a low price then you have to make other sacrifices.\n\nWe will now examine these questions: How do consumers behave in relation to price? Are there ‘deal buyers’ and ‘premium buyers’? We will also outline the managerial motivation for running price promotions and reveal what actually happens when price promotions are run. The question of longer-term effects (good or bad) is also addressed. Finally, we will discuss the capacity of price promotions to actually reach buyers.\n\n# Consumers buy across a range of price levels",

For example, it is thought that there are low-end shoppers, those who buy in the middle range and others who buy premium products. The notion of the ‘deal-prone’ shopper reinforces this view. However, research into actual buying behaviour shows that consumers do not confine themselves to one price category. Most consumers buy across a range of prices – over time they will buy the same brand at different prices and also buy brands that sit at different prices. This might be because of availability, promotions, something catching their eye, differing needs, mood swings, wanting a change, granny coming to visit and so on. These many random influences result in law-like patterns in cross-buying at different price levels. For example, Table 10.1 shows that in the instant coffee market in the UK about half (51%) of those buying in the cheapest price range (denoted as ‘- -‘) also bought in the most expensive price range (‘+ +’). Similarly, of those buying in the below-average price range (‘-‘), 57% also bought in the most expensive price range, and so on. Overall, these patterns are dictated by the number of people who buy in each price range, much like the double jeopardy law for brand buying described in Chapter 2.\n\nThat is, people who buy in any price tier will also buy in other price tiers, in line with how big those other price tiers are.\n\n**Table 10.1:** Buying in different price tiers: instant coffee in a year",

Each buyer group's overall market share is indicated, alongside the percentage of buyers within that group who also purchase products in other specific price tiers, denoted by '-', '—', '++', and '+'. For instance, 35% of buyers perceive products as \"Below average\" and within this segment, 64% also purchase \"—\" tier products, 57% purchase \"++\" tier products, and 36% purchase \"+\" tier products. Conversely, the \"Cheap\" buyer segment, representing 31% of the market, shows 69% also buying \"-\" tier products, 51% buying \"++\" tier products, and 30% buying \"+\" tier products. The \"Expensive\" segment (27% share) exhibits 66% purchasing \"-\" tier products, 55% purchasing \"—\" tier products, and 39% purchasing \"+\" tier products. Finally, the \"Above average\" segment (7% share) shows 78% purchasing \"-\" tier products, 61% purchasing \"—\" tier products, and 73% purchasing \"++\" tier products.

The same is true for premium brands – many sales actually come from the ‘low price’ buyers who occasionally buy a higher priced brand. So in any particular market, there are consumers who habitually buy a range of brands and pay a range of prices. It is therefore hard to successfully target an exclusively ‘low price buyer’ segment with price promotions, because such a segment doesn’t usually exist.\n\n# Why do managers run price promotions?",

Sometimes more than half a brand’s sales are made at the discounted price. This raises the question of which of the two price levels is the normal price for the brand?\n\nWhat is the purpose of generating these short-term sales spikes? In many cases they do not deliver extra profit, because the margin given away on sales would have been made anyway, at full price.\n\nPrice promotions are popular with managers because the results are easy to see. More stock is sold. If a brand is sold through retailer outlets, sales tracking immediately shows an impressive spike. The immediacy is attractive. This may be important for a company that needs to transform inventory into money. There are other related reasons – such as managers being under pressure to make unit sales budgets. Price promotions deliver these results, but they also lead to next year’s volume targets that require more price discounting. Price promotions can become a way of life for organisations because winding them back would result in failing to hit sales targets. Therefore, such promotions are highly addictive for marketers.",

      "content": "Another reason for the popularity of these discounts is that distribution channels (such as retailers) demand them, because a retailer can then offer discounts to consumers and build an image of good value. Discounts at the retail level also allow a retailer to maintain competitive pressure on its rivals. Therefore, price promotions on the part of manufacturers can be one of the costs of maintaining good relationships with retail distributors. Unfortunately, in-store promotions empower the distributor because the market share of the brand becomes dependent on the distributor’s decisions. Price promotions can also ‘buy time’ for a brand – boost sales in the short term or save it from being delisted. However, something must be done while the clock is ticking, and there is evidence that more emphasis on price promotions is accompanied by lower emphasis on innovation (Pauwels et al., 2004). Finally, it may be that price promotions are so popular because it is hard to think of more creative ideas for brand strategy.\n\n# Price promotions don’t win new customers\n\nSome marketers believe that price cuts attract new customers to buy a brand: customers who might later come back and make more purchases at full price. However, there is little evidence this occurs. Ehrenberg, Hammond and Goodhardt (1994) found that almost everyone who bought a brand during a price promotion had bought the brand previously. Some academic researchers have even found that some sales in a price promotion have been brought forward from future sales, so the spike in volume at the time of the sale is cancelled out to some degree because of lower sales post promotion. Fortunately, the evidence is that the main effect is brand substitution, not forward buying.",

      "content": "If price promotions can’t attract new buyers, can they at least bring back infrequent buyers? Perhaps the acts of purchase and use could reinforce infrequent buyers’ propensity to buy again. This possibility has been investigated as the ‘purchase reinforcement effect’. What has been found is that a price promotion pulls in a large proportion of infrequent buyers (i.e. buyers who have a low propensity to buy a brand). They buy during the promotion and then afterwards resume their very low buying propensity. In other words, after the promotional purchase it is as if nothing happened. Why is this the case? Let’s think about consumers’ purchases over a long period. They may have purchased that category dozens or hundreds of times before. Buying this brand on deal is nothing special to consumers; they have bought that brand before, just as they have bought competitor brands before, either on special or at normal price. Now let us consider what might occur before these infrequent buyers purchase from the category again. Ehrenberg’s work over decades shows that the incidence of category purchasing follows a negative binomial distribution (NBD): lots of infrequent buyers and a few frequent buyers (Ehrenberg 1959; Goodhardt, Ehrenberg & Chatfield 1984). So for the majority of buyers, a lot of time may elapse before they buy from that particular category again. While the elapsed time between purchases may only be a week or two for some buyers in some categories (e.g. regular milk or bread buyers), it could be several months for instant coffee or toothpaste and six months to a year for less regularly purchased goods. When the time does come for customers to re-buy from the category in question, they may have purchased dozens of brands in a range of other categories. Some of those purchases will have been on special, some not. This means that the act of buying any one particular brand on promotion in any one particular category will easily be forgotten before the next time. Buying brands that are temporarily promoted is a routine, very frequent behaviour for consumers. There is little scope for a permanent or semi-permanent behavioural change. In summary, what price promotions do (for established brands) is to jolt the short-term buying propensities of mainly infrequent buyers who take the opportunity to buy the brand cheaply and then resume their normal purchase behaviour afterwards (i.e. to buy it sometimes as part of a wider repertoire). As Pauwels, Hanssens and Siddarth (2002, p. 437) state, “Price promotions produce only temporary benefits for established brands”.",

      "content": "# Negative after-effects\n\nMany marketers are justifiably worried about the possible negative after-effects of price promotions. Such after-effects include consumer resistance to paying normal price after purchasing at a discounted price; this is a manifestation of the ‘reference price effect’.\n\nA number of studies have found reference price effects (e.g. Hardie, Johnson & Fader, 1993; Lattin & Bucklin 1989) in grocery markets. However, another stream of research on price knowledge has found that many consumers struggle to recall the prices they paid for goods (Vanhuele & Dreze 2002). How can there be a reference price effect if consumers have a low level of price recall and buying brands on special is routine? Let’s tackle this paradox by reviewing the reference price research and the studies on price recall, and then reconcile the results from both research streams.\n\n# Reference price\n\nThe academic research on pricing emphasises the notion of a consumer reference price – especially the consumer’s internal reference price, which is a memory or expectation of what prices should be (note: the concept of an external reference price refers to information on the prices of alternatives). This expectation of price is thought to be generated by exposure to prices in the past, either by purchasing or observing communications such as ads. The idea of a reference price is that ‘past prices matter’ and if consumers encounter a price above their reference price, this dampens their propensity to buy.\n\n# Price knowledge\n\nWe have to reconcile the notion of a reference price effect with consumers’ less-than-perfect knowledge about prices and the routine nature of shopping described above. Many studies of consumers’ ability to recall prices have shown their recall to be poor. In the US, a large-scale study (Dickson & Sawyer 1990) was conducted in which shoppers were intercepted shortly after selecting a product; of these shoppers, only about half knew the price of the item they selected to within 5%. In France, the figure was about a third of shoppers (Vanhuele & Dreze 2002). It seems that either the memory trace for the price of the item was very momentary, or that little attention was paid to the price of the item in the first place. In the Dickson and Sawyer study, many shoppers claimed they did not check the price of the item or check the prices of alternatives.",

      "content": "The initial findings about consumers’ price knowledge, such as the Dickson and Sawyer (1990) study, were based on price recall. More recently, researchers have argued that two other measures are more appropriate:\n\nrecognition and deal spotting. Recognition studies show shoppers three prices for an item that are (for example) the normal price, 10% above the normal price and 10% below the normal price. Vanheule and Dreze (2002) applied this approach to consumers, and found that only 13% of shoppers identified the correct price. This suggests that price recognition is also rather poor. In terms of deal spotting, approximately 50% of the time shoppers appear to be able to spot a ‘good deal’ for a particular brand based on being shown a (discounted) price for it.\n\nThe conclusion is that while consumers’ knowledge about prices is hazy, an appreciable proportion of consumers has a fair idea about price within a zone of the actual price. Also, consumers do seem to be aware of relativities between brands (i.e. X is usually more expensive than Y), rather than absolute price levels, and that comparison between available brands is more important.\n\nSo, will a temporary price promotion have negative after-effects for a brand? The answer is no, but repetitively doing it may have negative after-effects. This is because if consumers commonly encounter low prices and ‘deal’ signals for a brand, their reference price for it will be lowered. Also, customers will get used to seeing price-related information for the brand, which will raise the salience of price (and/or on-deal stickers) and possibly lower the salience of other important brand attributes. US studies (Mela, Gupta & Lehmann 1997; Mela, Jedidi & Bowman 1998) found that more frequent promotions result in heightened sensitivity to price among consumers, as well as slightly longer interpurchase times and slightly higher purchase quantities. That is, consumers learn to not only buy on deal, but to also buy a little more during the price promotion, which results in less frequent purchases.",

Managers tend to over-react to each other’s price reductions (Brodie, Bonfrer & Cutler 1996). More broadly, competitor response to price has been shown to be less than rational, with some firms placing more emphasis on ‘beating’ the competition with low prices than on pursuing profit. Companies that do this tend to depress their profits (Armstrong & Collopy 1996; Armstrong & Green 2007). An interesting example of the destructive potential of a ‘beat the competition’ mentality is the price war between Greyhound and Peter Pan Trailways (Heil & Helsen 2001 p. 86). The price of a bus fare went from $25 to $9.95 to $7 to $6.95, and then Greyhound offered a $4 fare, which was lower than the price it had charged 40 years previously. This rapid, ruinous price descent took place over a short period of three weeks. In extreme cases, price wars can bankrupt multiple players.\n\nTherefore, a decision to engage in discounting, or to escalate it, must consider that competitors are likely to respond in kind, which will result in lower profits, or even severe hardship, for all players.\n\n# How much extra volume does a price cut generate?\n\nPrice promotions boost sales volume in the short term; but by how much? The term used to discuss this is price ‘elasticity’ – the percentage change in volume from a 1% change in price. For example, if a price is cut by 10% and sales volume increases by 20%, the elasticity is -2 (20/10 = 2, the minus indicates that price and volume move in opposite directions).\n\nStudies have found a reasonable degree of consistency in the average elasticity for temporary promotions. Danaher and Brodie (2000, p. 923) found an average price elasticity of -2.3 across 26 categories, with almost all the price changes examined being for temporary promotions. Scriven and Ehrenberg (2004) found an average elasticity of -2.6 in an exhaustive series of experiments that included both price increases and decreases. Steenkamp and colleagues (2005) examined 442 product categories and reported a mean elasticity of -4.0. Summaries of in-market studies have found an average price elasticity of -2.5 (Bijmolt, van Heerde & Pieters 2005; Tellis 1988).",

      "content": "These results suggest that on average we can expect an increase in sales volume of approximately 25% from a 10% price cut. Most of the authors cited above point out that individual elasticity can vary greatly from 0 to -20 or bigger, although the majority, 70% or so, fall in the range just smaller than -1 to -4. Scriven and Ehrenberg shed light on this variation, showing that elasticity is not a fixed property of a brand, but varies systematically with the context in which a choice decision is made. They found that five factors consistently led to bigger price elasticities, which are now explained.\n\n# Factors leading to bigger price elasticities\n\n### 1) *If the brand’s price moves past a local ‘reference price’*\n\nPeople are more likely to switch from brand A to brand B when B becomes cheaper than A (where previously, B was more expensive). Changing relative price positions is far more effective than just narrowing the price gap. Similarly, widening a price gap that already exists has less effect than changing relative positions.\n\nAlso, the larger competitor brand B is, the bigger the effect. Therefore, setting the price of a brand slightly below that of the biggest brands in the category may be a better tactic than either deeply undercutting the leaders’ prices, or setting the price close to the leader’s price, but not undercutting it.\n\n## 2) If the price change is explicitly signalled\n\nSignalling the price change has a big effect. The signalling effect links to the notion that consumers have imperfect awareness of prices and their relativities. Therefore, if we draw attention to a price cut (e.g. ‘was $54 now $30’), more people will be aware of the price and act on it. Also, of course, consumers like a bargain. Many studies of the effect of in-store price signals such as signage and displays can result in massive, short-term gains in sales. If a price cut is accompanied by in-store advertising, sales can increase by as much as 400% (Woodside & Waddle, 1975). In the UK, Hamilton, East and Kalafatis (1997) reported that price cuts coupled with additional promotional support can increase sales by around 200-500%. Totten and Block (1994, p. 70) reported that a deep price cut of 45%, supported by feature or display advertising, can increase sales by approximately 280% and possibly as much as 400%.",

      "content": "## 3) If the brand’s share is low\n\nBig brands have smaller price elasticities; small brands have bigger elasticities. This is an arithmetic effect, a result of elasticity being calculated using percentages. It is easy to imagine a brand moving from a 2% to a 6% market share (e.g. with a 50% price cut, this would require an elasticity of -4). The same elasticity and price cut on a brand with a 30% market share could enlarge the brand’s share to 90%, which is almost impossible to achieve. This difference in elasticity means small brands can enjoy bigger uplifts from promotions, but suffer more than big brands when they increase prices. Conversely, bigger brands find it harder to get really big proportional sales rises from promotions, but suffer a little less than small brands when they put prices up.\n\n## 4) If the price is increased from its normal level\n\nIt is often assumed that elasticity is the same for price rises as cuts, but there is no reason why this should be so. Empirical results from a series of experiments (Scriven & Ehrenberg 2004) show that price increases have a bigger effect on volume than cuts do – if we consider the sole effect of a price change, divorced from extra effects of signalling or in-store support.\n\nLarger price elasticities for price increases are consistent with a well-known finding in consumer psychology called ‘loss aversion’. Experimental studies show support for loss aversion; for example, many consumers are reluctant to accept fair bets because the potential loss, of say $20, outweighs the attractiveness of possibly winning $20 (Kahneman & Tversky 1979). If consumers have an approximate reference price for a brand, an increase above that reference level is perceived as a ‘loss’ with a corresponding drop in the likelihood of purchase.\n\nThis differential effect of price increases appears to be even more marked for private label brands: their downward price elasticity tends to be quite low (because they are already often cheaper), but if their price is put up, their sales loss is quite pronounced.\n\n### 5) If the brand’s normal price is close to the average of the other brands",

      "content": "If the price of a brand is close to the average prices of competitors, its elasticity will be greater. There are two reasons for this. First, if prices for all the brands are very dispersed, then a price change by one brand bridges the price gap between it and competitors by a smaller amount.\n\nSecond, if the brand’s price is close to the average of competitors, a price change – either upward or downward – will take the brand past the price of one or more of those competitors (i.e. go from cheaper to dearer, or vice versa). Pricing experiments showed average price elasticities in double figures when all the brands start at the same price – because a change results in setting one brand’s price below all the others, resulting in a huge swing in consumer choice. A good example of this phenomenon is petrol in urban locations where it is easy to switch from one station to another.\n\nBy contrast, elasticities are smaller when a brand’s price is further away from the centre or average of the prices in its category. This dampening effect on price elasticity is especially marked if most of the other competitor brands’ prices are close together.\n\nThere are three other category characteristics that lead to larger price elasticities. These are  \n(1) categories with fewer brands,  \n(2) goods that consumers buy very regularly and  \n(3) categories that can be stockpiled (Narasimhan, Neslin & Sen 1996).\n\n# Can price cuts be profitable?\n\nAn important point to make is that even very large increases in volume may still not make any extra contribution to profit. This is because, when a price is cut, the contribution margin for each item is cut even more. For example, if the normal contribution margin on a product is 50%, a 10% price cut shaves 20% off the contribution margin. In the Totten and Block (1994) example (previously discussed), a price cut as reported of 45% would eliminate virtually all the contribution margin for a normal packaged goods brand; therefore, the brand is being sold at close to manufacturing cost. So while the brand could sell 400% more volume, it would not make any more profit, because there is almost no contribution margin on each item sold.\n\nThe short-term profitability of a price promotion depends on these three factors:",

If the contribution margin is low to begin with, a massive increase in sales is needed to break even. If the contribution margin is high, a price cut can earn more profit, even from a modest increase in sales. This is because every extra unit still carries enough contribution to pay for the price cut. Three example scenarios are shown in Table 10.2. The first example shows that a brand selling at the normal price and earning a 30% contribution margin and employing a 10% price cut must sell 50% more just to make the same amount of money. If the promotion creates an increase in sales of anything less than 50%, the brand will lose money!\n\n**Table 10.2: Break-even scenarios**\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of the sales volume increase required to maintain the current contribution margin across different price reduction scenarios and brand contribution margins. The structure is comparative, examining three distinct brand contribution margins (30%, 40%, and 50%) against three price reduction percentages (5%, 10%, and 20%). For each price reduction, the table quantifies the necessary percentage increase in sales volume to offset the reduced margin per unit. Notably, higher initial contribution margins generally require smaller sales volume increases to compensate for the same price reduction. Conversely, lower initial contribution margins necessitate significantly larger sales volume increases to achieve the same financial outcome. The data highlights the sensitivity of contribution margin to price reductions, particularly for brands with lower initial margins.\n\nSuch large increases in sales are needed because a price reduction results in selling lots of volume to people who would have bought the brand anyway, at full price. Therefore, the incremental volume has to be high to ‘pay for’ the lost margin on what we can call the baseline volume.\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 10.1. There are some obvious spikes in sales that are one-week price specials.",

These normal sales would have been sold at full price, not a discounted price.\n\nBecause the contribution margin is reduced by an exponentially increasing rate from larger discounts, the implication for managers employing price promotions is that they should make them as shallow as possible (e.g. 10% off, not 20% off). Even if this does not result in such high volume increases, at least the volume is making more contribution to profit.\n\nThere is another factor that can impinge on the short-term profitability of a price promotion: unit sales may decline immediately afterwards. This can happen because the promotion has induced some consumers to accelerate their purchases. Empirical evidence suggests a trough can occur in sales after a promotion (Mace & Neslin 2004; van Heerde, Leeflang & Wittink 2000). If this happens, the promotion has borrowed some full-price, full-margin sales from the future; this dissipates its potential profitability. Managers should allow for this effect when evaluating promotions.\n\nFinally there is the very likely competitor reaction, that is that they will match promotions in order to maintain their sales. In which case every extra sale you make while on discount represents a future full price sale that will now not occur. This is a very high, and largely forgotten, cost of price promotions.\n\n**Figure 10.1:** Sales for a leading cereal brand\n\nThis data presents a series of sales figures for a leading cereal brand, illustrating a clear downward trend. The figures provided are 15.00, 11.25, 7.50, 3.75, and 0. These values represent a progressive decrease in sales, starting from a high of 15.00 and culminating at zero. The structure is a simple, linear progression of quantitative data points, indicating a decline over an unspecified period or across different metrics. The absence of accompanying labels or context within the table suggests these figures might represent sales over time, market share, or some other quantifiable metric where a reduction is being depicted.\n\n*Source: Data supplied by Synovate Aztec.*\n\nWe now compare pricing with advertising as a means of stimulating demand Comparing price versus advertising",

      "content": "Price cutting has a large, direct effect, but a very small reach. Advertising has great reach but a small direct effect at the level of the individual consumer. Advertising arguably also has a long lasting effect, because it works on underlying propensities, whereas price promotion does not affect ongoing propensity and does not have favourable long-term effects.\n\nIt is certainly true that in-store price promotions are highly targeted: they only reach the buyers who are in the market for that category in that week. It would therefore seem they should be very efficient. However, this targeting through price promotions is very expensive – 10% or 20% off the price of every item sold! Price cutting gives a lot away to people who would buy the brand anyway.\n\nFor manufacturers who sell through distribution channels, price promotions can occur with several levels of retailer support, and retailer support has implications for reach. The lowest level of support is an in-store price cut with only the ubiquitous ‘special’ ticket on shelf. An in-store price cut has the lowest level of reach, because only consumers who happen to be in the store and look at brands in the category at the time will notice it. The number of consumers who would do so in any given week comprise a very small proportion of the market. For example, in grocery markets, in a typical promotion period of two weeks, approximately 60% of households buy bread, 20% buy soup and 10% purchase a category such as shampoo – but these figures are the total penetration across all retailers. A price promotion in any one retailer will only reach a fraction of these buyers: given a retailer market share of say 10%, such a price promotion in that retailer will only reach 10% x 60% = 6% of bread buyers, 10% x 20% = 2% of soup buyers and 10% x 10% = 1% of shampoo buyers. So this sort of price promotion has very low reach.\n\nThe next level of in-store support involves an ‘end-of-aisle’ display. Nearly everyone in the store at the time could notice this display, but there is an upper limit on its reach, being the proportion of the population shopping in that retailer in that week – which is often a small proportion.",

      "content": "The third level of distributor support involves the brand being advertised in catalogues or through the retailer’s mass media advertising. This takes the price promotion, and the brand, to a much broader audience. Arguably, the reach of this level of support is as large as the reach of mainstream advertising.\n\nHowever, advertising a price promotion so widely risks lowering the reference price for the brand to a wider group of people. Therefore, it might be preferable to organise an off-shelf display or retailer advertising without the price cut. Problem is, price-cutting is usually mandatory to obtain an off-shelf display or to feature in the retailer’s advertising.\n\nTo summarise, the following observations have been made in this book:  \n* Reach is important for brand growth.  \n* In-store promotions generally lack reach, but retailer advertising has much broader reach.  \n* Price promotions may not be profitable, particularly when the price cut is deep.  \n* There is the possibility that reference prices would be eroded, particularly from deep price cuts.  \n* However, manufacturers often feel pressurised to participate in price promotions.\n\nBased on these observations, if a manufacturer had to choose between a promotion that emphasised deep price cuts or a promotion that focused on advertising the brand, the manufacturer should select the latter. This is because the brand would then feature in retailer advertising, which works more like normal advertising and attains reach for the brand. This communication may have to be linked to a reduced price, but the price need not be as low as it would be if the emphasis was all on price and less on communication support.\n\n# Managing Price Promotion Addiction\n\nA price promotion will deliver an increase in sales in most cases. How large this sales increase is and whether the promotion totally decimates all profits depends on factors such as the size of the brand and what its price is relative to the competition before and after the price cut. Current evidence suggests there is no long-term increase in sales as a result of the spike in sales during the price promotion: buyers return to their pre-promotion buying patterns and sales return to pre-promotion levels. This means that a price promotion’s effect on sales and profit can be easily evaluated – the analyst need only consider the sales spike during the promotion period, any possible trough in sales immediately afterward, and likely competitor retaliatory promotions.",

A commonly cited reason for manufacturers to run promotions is to please or placate the retailer. In the long run this may be the only justifiable reason for price promotions, but if maintaining retailer relations is the objective of a price promotion then this should be the metric that is evaluated – yet such evaluation is seldom done in any formal sense.\n\nTo conclude, much price discounting is significantly costly: it erodes brand margins for the benefit of the retailer and consumer. The advice to brand owners is to think long and hard about what price-cutting activity is achieving in the long term, and try to reverse the long-term trend of marketing money being transferred from brand-building activities to discounting. Ask how many price promotions are really needed to avoid delisting from a retailer, and avoid doing more than this.",

      "content": "## The Scientific Laws\n\nByron Sharp One thing that emerges from the law-like patterns discussed in this book is that everything varies together.\n\nAs brands get bigger (i.e. gain market share) their metrics move in the opposite direction to the metrics of brands that are shrinking. Bigger brands have higher penetration and loyalty metrics (both attitudinal and behavioural). This pattern doesn’t fit with many old theories of how markets work. But this is the way the real world works. This suggests that marketing metrics, including market share, all reflect one thing: popularity. Therefore, brands vary in their popularity, and everything flows from that. Also, two rival brands with similar levels of popularity will have very similar metrics.\n\nThese patterns are so robust that a single mathematical model predicts many of the laws in this book. This model is the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice and purchase rates (usually simply called ‘the Dirichlet’) developed by Gerald Goodhardt, Andrew Ehrenberg and Chris Chatfield (see Ehrenberg, Uncles Goodhardt, 2004; Goodhardt, Ehrenberg Chatfield, 1984). It is a model about consumers/buyers. It assumes that buying behaviour is heterogeneous and probabilistic; in other words, we each have a certain propensity to buy (some of us buy more often than others) and a certain propensity to buy particular brands (we each have our own preferences or personal repertoires). The Dirichlet is 30 years old and has survived 30 years of testing. It is one of marketing science’s greatest achievements; for more information, see www.MarketingScience.info.\n\nThe law-like patterns (empirical laws) that are introduced in this book are:\n\n* **Double jeopardy law:** Brands with less market share have far fewer buyers, and these buyers are slightly less loyal (in their buying and attitudes). For implications see Chapter 2.\n\n* **Retention double jeopardy:** All brands lose some buyers; this loss is proportionate to their market share (i.e. big brands lose more customers; though these represent a smaller proportion of their total customer base). For implications see Chapter 3.\n\n* **Pareto law: 60/20:** Slightly more than half of a brand’s sales come from the top 20% of its customers. The remaining sales come from the bottom 80% of its customers (i.e. the Pareto law is not 80/20). For implications * **Law of buyer moderation:** In subsequent time periods heavy buyers buy less often (than in the base period that was used to categorise them as heavy buyers).",

If 30% of a brand’s buyers also bought brand A in a period, then around 30% of every rival brand’s customers also bought brand A over that period. See Chapter 6.\n\n* **Non-linear relationship between physical availability and market share:** 80% or more weighted physical distribution is necessary, but not sufficient, for a brand to have high market share.\n\n* **NBD-Dirichlet:** A mathematical model of how buyers vary in their purchase propensities, i.e their loyalties (how often they buy the category and which brands they buy). It correctly describes and explains many of the above laws. ‘The Dirichlet’ as it is known was developed by Gerald Goodhardt, Andrew Ehrenberg and Chris Chatfield. It is one of marketing’s few true scientific theories (i.e. based on empirical laws). For more technical information on this mathematical model (and related software) see Goodhardt et al (1984), and contact the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute www.MarketingScience.info W-W\n\nByron Sharp",

Their parents had a beautiful orchard with many lemon trees. So one day they decided to make lemonade. Over time they became very proficient lemonade makers. Each summer, during school vacation, they sold their lemonade to friends and neighbours.\n\nThe little girls grew up, got married and moved to the big city. They lived on opposite sides of the town and, sadly, they saw little of each other. However, they both continued to make and market lemonade.\n\nGeorgiana had married the owner of a newspaper (her sister June had married a lawyer) and one year she decided to place advertisements for her lemonade in her husband’s newspaper. They said “Georgiana’s lemonade: real lemony”. Nothing dramatic happened but Georgiana’s sales steadily grew – eventually she had to source additional supplies of lemons. In the following years, her sales continued to grow slowly, with occasional jumps when a new store started stocking Georgiana’s lemonade.\n\nMeanwhile, the sales of June’s lemonade also grew for a while, then for a long time they were steady and then her sales started to decline slightly. One Christmas she discussed this with her sister Georgiana, and on her advice began to advertise. June’s advertisements featured the cunningly crafted message “June’s lemonade: lemon goodness”.\n\nToday Georgiana’s brand is the largest with slightly more than 60% market share. It is stocked in more stores, it gets more publicity, has more buyers and more people say they prefer it. June’s lemonade also continues to sell well and make a profit. She has almost 40% relative market share and her sales decline has stopped. The percentage of June’s buyers who say it tastes great is similar to the percentage of buyer’s who like the taste of Georgiana’s lemonade.",

      "content": "If you accept that Georgiana and June’s story is plausible, then you believe advertising works. This is logical, because billions of dollars are spent on advertising; an amazing 2% of the world’s entire production (GDP) is devoted to advertising. Yet, things are never as clear as they are in Georgiana and June’s world; in the real world, mysteries and contradictions abound. For large brands that have the biggest advertising budgets, sales seldom rise when advertising starts, nor slump when it stops<sup>68</sup>. Also, most buyers say that advertising rarely affects them. Even advertising agencies are extremely reluctant to say that advertising causes sales; they’d much rather talk about engagement, building brand equity, emotional commitment, and added values. In contrast, opponents of advertising say it is a powerful manipulative force. “Advertising troubles both sociologists and financial directors: the former because they think it works, the latter because they think it does not” (Bullmore 1999).\n\nWhat is going on? Who is right? What evidence is there that advertising drives sales? How does advertising really work? How should marketers use advertising? How should marketers measure advertising’s effects? This chapter answers these questions and presents a model of brand advertising that is consistent with what we know about brand buying behaviour and memory. The shift in thinking is summarised in Table 9.1.\n\n**Table 9.1: Advertising**\n\nThis table outlines a shift in advertising strategy, moving from a \"Past world view\" to a \"New world view.\" The past approach focused on rational or emotional appeals, message comprehension, unique selling propositions, persuasion, teaching, and positioning. In contrast, the new world view emphasizes emotional and rational appeals, prioritizing getting noticed over deep comprehension. It shifts from unique selling propositions to building relevant associations, and from persuasion to refreshing and building memory structures. The focus also moves from teaching to reaching the audience, and from positioning to achieving salience. This represents a transition from a product-centric, information-driven model to a more audience-centric, attention-grabbing, and memory-focused approach.\n\nNeuroscience and psychology have recently advanced our understanding of how memories and brains work. These discoveries have important implications for advertising, because advertising works by creating and refreshing memories. It is now known that much thinking and decision-making is non-conscious and emotional. Yet traditional theories of advertising are based on a dated view that we are usually rational (occasionally emotional) decision-makers, with near perfect memories.",

      "content": "Before we discuss how advertising works, we look first at the evidence for advertising sales effects (i.e. how advertising nudges buying behaviour). This insight, from marketing science, complements the perspective above. It is a story that has not been told before, yet it provides a deep understanding of how advertising works and why the sales effects are so hard to measure reliably.\n\n# The sales response to brand advertising\n\nThe purpose of brand advertising is to affect the buying behaviour of consumers. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. The billions of dollars spent on brand advertising are spent to protect and build sales; logically, this can only happen by affecting buying behaviour and by enhancing and restoring purchase probabilities.\n\nMany people involved in crafting advertising get squeamish with this idea. The reason for this odd behaviour is that they associate sales effects with a limited type of advertising (e.g. “Sale starts this Thursday” and “Crazy discounts – buy now, now, now!”). This sort of advertising often results in observable sales increases, whereas much brand advertising has little or no demonstrable effect on next week’s sales figures. This observation leads to the assumption that advertising does something else other than affect buying. So to justify advertising, marketers invoke concepts such as brand equity, commitment and loyalty, often in a very mystical manner. This makes financial directors and hard-nosed CEOs suspect that the money they spend on advertising is going down the drain.\n\nThere is solid empirical evidence that brand advertising does produce sales. Yet the effects of advertising are very difficult to see in sales trends. The reasons for this are not well understood, and this ignorance means that some people who study sales effects (e.g. econometric modelling consultancies and academics) often get their estimates wrong.\n\nThere are two reasons why advertising’s sales effects are hard to see in weekly and monthly sales figures (i.e. sales neither jump when advertising starts or increases, nor collapse when it is reduced). The proper effect of advertising on sales is often missed because:\n\n* The aim of most advertising is to maintain market share, that is, to prevent sales from not occurring. Few companies spend enough (or create good enough advertising) to increase market share or accelerate an upwards trend.",

      "content": "Mostly, advertising is used to prevent what (without advertising) would be a very gentle decline in sales. Broadbent (1989) provides an apt analogy of this: “The sales of a brand are like the height at which an airplane flies. Advertising spend is like its engines: while the engines are running everything is fine, but when the engines stop, the descent eventually starts”. Much advertising is aimed at preventing competitors’ advertising from stealing future sales. This prevention means a brand enjoys sales, over a long period of time, that it would not have otherwise obtained if it had not advertised. So advertising causes sales even if a brand’s sales figures are flat.\n\n* Advertising’s sales effects are spread out in time. This means that the effect of today’s advertising is layered very thinly across weekly sales figures over a long time period. It typically takes dramatic bursts of expenditure to cause a week’s figures to detectably increase. This is particularly the case for large brands, because their advertising expenditure is small in comparison to their other marketing efforts, such as their ongoing word of mouth, their sheer physical presence (shelf space is advertising too) and the already established mental availability (past advertising effects) in many consumers’ heads. Changes in advertising weight are more likely to make weekly sales figures of a small brand move up and down because it doesn’t have a large base of sales that are supported by existing market-based assets.\n\nConsequently, statistical models of changes in advertising spend and changes in overall sales report a weak association. But if we look below the surface and divide the consumers who were exposed to the advertising from those who are not, then we can see sales effects that were previously masked. The value of ‘single source’ individual-level data is illustrated in Figure 9.1, where the data shows that despite declining sales (because of competitive pressure) the brand’s advertising really was generating purchases among those consumers who saw the ad.\n\n**Figure 9.1:** Brand purchasing households, per dollars/1000 households *Source: Flaherty 2007.*",

      "content": "This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing, specifically focusing on household spending in dollars per thousand households, under varying conditions of competitive pressure and television advertising exposure. The table displays six distinct dollar values, likely representing different market segments or time periods, with three values ($269, $250, $258) appearing in the first row and three others ($257, $212, $192) in the second. A central theme of \"Competitive pressure\" is indicated, with a distinction made between a \"Pre Period\" and the impact of \"TV Ads on air.\" Further segmentation categorizes households as either \"Exposed to ads\" or \"Not exposed to ads,\" suggesting an investigation into how advertising influences purchasing behavior within a competitive landscape. The structure implies a comparison of spending levels across these different exposure and competitive scenarios.\n\nWhen more rigorous controls of other causal influences on sales are in place (e.g. Danaher, Bonfrer & Dhar 2008), advertising’s effects on aggregate data *appear* greater, as we would expect; however, with aggregate data this is fiendishly difficult to do, making it astonishingly hard to see advertising’s proper sales effects.\n\nThis is a difficult concept to grasp because it seems counterintuitive – advertising causes sales even when weekly sales figures don’t change.\n\nWhen sales figures do change, this still gives an incorrect indication of the true effect advertising has on sales. Movements in this week’s or month’s sales figures don’t reveal the full sales impact of advertising – they are like the tip of the iceberg but we don’t know what proportion of the total iceberg the tip represents.\n\nThis isn’t always the case; for some advertising, the effect on sales occurs immediately. An example of this is the advertising that informs its audience of a time-dependent event, for example, ‘Sale ends this Thursday’.<sup>69</sup> But most advertising affects people who won’t buy the brand for weeks, so the sales effects are spread far into the future. Hence, the effect on sales is spread so thinly over a week’s sales figures, that a change in weight of advertising delivers no visible change in sales trajectory. A little bit of your advertising today works today, but much is to prevent people from being less likely to buy you when they make their next category purchase in months/years time.",

      "content": "# How advertising and price promotions cause sales in different ways Chapter 4 discussed how all brands, even very large ones, have mostly very light (i.e.\n\nvery occasional) buyers (see Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). We saw that most Coca-Cola buyers only buy themselves a Coke once or twice a year. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a tiny portion of consumers who buy Coke every morning, noon and night. Consider what happens to the buying behaviour of a person who drinks Coke several times a day after seeing a Coca-Cola ad – nothing changes. So who is Coke’s advertising aimed at? It’s aimed at the millions of people who occasionally buy Coca-Cola, who scarcely ever think of Coke and who seldom buy it. These consumers could easily forget about it and not make their semiannual purchases. This is why established brands need to advertise: to hold onto their buyers (in the face of substantial competitor advertising) and to give themselves a chance to grow.\n\nCoke’s advertising tries to grab a tiny window of our attention and remind us that Coke is fun, that we’ve had it before and we like it – Coke’s advertisements are mostly reminding us of things we already know. By doing this, Coke is trying to increase our (very low) probability of buying it tomorrow. If it works, it changes our probability of buying tomorrow from almost nothing (say 1 chance in 400) to slightly more than almost nothing (say 2 chances in 400). This is a change in probability that is so slight we’d hardly notice, which is why people say that advertising doesn’t affect them, because it’s too subtle for them to notice. But if every person who is exposed to a single Coca-Cola ad increases his or her buying propensity from 1 chance in 400 to 2 chances in 400, Coke’s sales among this group double! <sup>70</sup> Therefore, even advertising that says nothing persuasive and gives no new reasons to buy can have a dramatic impact on sales – without causing people to rethink their opinion of a brand, and largely without them even noticing.",

      "content": "This explains why even established brands have to spend considerable sums on advertising – the bigger the brand the more they have to spend, even if they are old and well known. It also explains why consumers often say they don’t believe they are affected by advertising. In addition, it accounts for why advertising’s sales effects show up in sales figures in a very different way than price promotions do. Put simply, the entire sales effect of a price promotion shows up in a week’s sales figures, while the sales effect of advertising is spread very thinly into the future; this makes changes in advertising weight very difficult to see and extraordinarily hard to measure/model reliably.\n\nAny marketing intervention, if it succeeds, works by increasing the probability that customers will purchase a product. Successful advertising reaches and affects many consumers. It reaches all types of consumers, not just the ones who are easy to reach (i.e. a brand’s heavy, regular buyers, who easily notice the brand’s advertising because their brand-related mental structures are better developed and they are less likely to screen out the advertising).\n\nSuccessful advertising, in particular, reaches the millions of consumers who have a very low probability of buying a brand next week or month. If a brand’s advertising reaches them, if they notice it, if it refreshes or builds the memory structures that make the brand more likely to be noticed or come to mind in a buying situation (i.e. enhancing mental availability), then it nudges their propensity to buy the brand. This is the sales effect. But most of these additional sales won’t show up in this week’s sales figures because hardly any of these consumers will buy this week; they simply don’t buy that often even with their newly enhanced propensity. Indeed, most of these extra sales will never show up as part of a lift in overall sales because, before the consumer even buys from the category, he or she will be hit with competitor advertising (or other marketing activity) that nullifies the effect of the advertising exposure. But this doesn’t mean that the sales effect didn’t happen; that nudge in propensity protected the brand’s sales from the effect of competitor activity. Instead of the competitor’s ad winning extra sales it merely got the brand back to where it had been before (see Danaher, Bonfrer & Dhar 2008).",

This means they will now make a purchase every 150 days, rather than once every 300 days. So these extra purchases still take a long while to occur. This is the meaning of advertising’s sales effects being spread thinly over time.\n\nThe reach of price promotions is very different. Their reach is very restricted as it’s skewed to heavier, more regular buyers of a brand. Also, the sales effects of price promotions aren’t spread out in time. In-store promotions only affect those people buying from the category in the week of the promotion. So the entire sales effect shows up in that week’s sales figures[^71]. That’s why price promotions show clear effects: sales increase immediately when price promotions are turned on, and sales decrease immediately when they are turned off.\n\n72 There might be a longer lasting effect if purchasing and using the discounted brand leads to enhanced mental availability, but the evidence is that longer term sales effects of price promotions are essentially zero (see Chapter 10). Advertising’s effect on purchase probability occurs through the effect on memories, and memories have some ability to last.73 Whereas price discounts affect purchase probability because we like a better deal, if one of the brands that we use and notice is on sale then the chance leaps that we choose it over the other brands in our repertoire – but our purchase probabilities return to normal immediately afterwards. So the price discount only works while it is there.\n\nThat’s great news for those seeking to measure the sales impact of price promotions (the full sales effect can be seen and measured in a week’s sales figures), but it’s sobering news for those seeking to measure the sales impact of advertising. It means you should never mix price promotion effects and advertising effects into a single econometric modelling attempt to quantify the relative sales effects of advertising and price changes.",

      "content": "However, the good news is that the sales response to advertising can be seen even when a market is stable and there is no aggregate level change in sales for the advertised brand. This requires what is known as ‘single-source data’: individual-level data that records continuously over time what each individual buys and what advertising they are exposed to. To explain the advantage of such data, consider how a direct marketer would assess the impact of a direct mail campaign to selected households in Chicago. Would they use national sales data? No. Would they use Chicago sales data? No. They would look at the buying patterns of the households they sent the letter to. No one expects sales to change in households that didn’t get the letter. Also, to correctly estimate the real sales impact, the marketer would compare sales among these households against a benchmark, such as the sales of similar households who were deliberately not sent the letter. Single-source data lets us employ the same logical approach to assessing the impact of television, print and other advertising exposures (Kennedy, McDonald & Sharp 2008; McDonald & Sharp 2005).\n\nForty years of single-source-based analysis has delivered solid empirical evidence that advertising drives sales among those who are exposed to it (and that some advertisements are vastly better than others). These findings have held across a range of brands, categories, countries and data sets (i.e. McDonald 1969; Jones 1995a & b; Roberts 1994; Roberts 1996; Roberts 1998; Newstead et al 2009; Taylor et al 2009; Wood 2009). This is good news for those who advertise.\n\nIt is also good news for advertisers who want to measure the sales effects of their advertising so that they can work out what creative executions and what media strategies work better.\n\nIn a review of his single-source data analysis of sales effective advertising, Professor John Philip Jones (1997) noted:\n\n> “The European styles of advertising … understated,  \n> softness, quirkiness, indirectness, unusual visual effects,  \n> and bizarre humour … are often surprisingly effective. …  \n> The advertising shown to have greatest effect … were  \n> certainly not hard-selling in the conventional sense … they  \n> were likeable … visual rather than verbal.”",

It makes sense given the importance of reaching all category buyers (see natural monopoly law), with solid coverage over time (i.e. no long gaps).\n\nAdvertising works by reaching brains and nudging buying propensities. This mostly happens without us noticing; occasionally an ad produces the reaction ‘I should buy that’ but even this intention only weakly nudges our buying propensities, because we often forget or are deflected from our intentions. This is a reminder that advertising works through its effect on memories.\n\n# Without noticing (and processing) there is nothing An advertisement cannot build memory structures if it is not processed; memory structures cannot generate sales if they are not associated with the brand that is being advertised.\n\nMost advertising exposures fail these two hurdles, so the money spent is wasted, or worse, the ad refreshes memories for competitor brands. As discussed in Chapter 1, less than 20% of television advertisements are both noticed and correctly branded (i.e. there is over 80% wastage). This is shocking; it’s alarming enough to think that large corporations would have a special task force, perhaps within marketing, that was charged with eradicating this problem. This task force would conduct research and development, set guidelines and cultivate techniques for developing and evaluating advertising to ensure that all a brand’s advertising passed these two hurdles. Yet the reality in most organisations is that these metrics are sometimes not even measured, no-one’s job depends on them, and no-one is responsible for fixing the problem. Therefore, no serious research and development is allocated to the issue – think how different this would be if the issue were wastage in the factory or product failures.",

      "content": "It’s true that advertising can work without us paying it much attention. We are able to notice things at a very low, even subconscious, level; for example, while in conversation at a crowded party we can still hear our name being called in the hubbub of background conversations. But just because part of our brain is monitoring our environment at a very low level, it doesn’t mean that it lets this information impinge much on our long-term memories. It’s better if advertising can generate more conscious attention and processing.\n\nAs people screen out so much advertising, the challenge is to get past the brain’s screening mechanisms and to generate that little emotional reaction in the direction of acceptance: ‘I will pay attention to this’. Therefore, the primary task of advertising agencies is to generate outstanding creative ideas that viewers will notice and will be willing to process over and over. This processing must be brand-centric; it must refresh the memory structures that relate to the brand. This is a difficult task, which is why most advertising fails. It’s also why some of the new findings from neuroscience and psychology are so important – we need to understand how attention and memories work.\n\nWe now know that very little thinking, if any, can be described as purely rational. Emotion is a primary source of human motivation, and exerts substantial influence on attention, memory and behaviour; it is no wonder emotion is heavily used in advertising. For example, emotion can be seen in advertising when the audience sheds a tear watching an ad for cancer research, or laughs with the characters in a beer ad, or shows shock, fear and relief watching an insurance ad.\n\nPeople watch movies, listen to music and read books largely for an emotional ride. They enjoy gaining the same from advertising and when they get it they pay more attention.\n\n# Memory is everything\n\nApart from a very small amount of direct-response advertising (including online search engine advertising), advertising must work through memories. This is an uncontroversial statement, yet it is common for marketers and academics to forget the essential role of memory; instead, they think advertising works largely through persuasive arguments or by creating emotional feelings about a brand.",

Even a frequently purchased item (e.g. margarine) is only bought, on average, eight times a year, and any single brand is only typically bought once or twice a year (Nielsen 2007). There can be many months between exposure to an ad and when the viewer is in a shopping situation with a relevant opportunity to recall brand memories (which are possibly influenced by the ad). To influence behaviour, advertising must work with people’s memories.\n\n# Advertising builds mental availability\n\nThe dominant way that advertising works is by refreshing, and occasionally building, memory structures. These structures improve the chance of a brand being noticed and/or recalled in buying situations; this in turn increases the chance of a brand being bought. Memory structures that relate to a brand include what the brand does, what it looks like, where it is available, when and where it is consumed, by who and with whom. Memories are associations with cues that can bring a brand to mind. They can also remind consumers to take it out of their pantry and eat it.\n\nThis is quite a different mechanism from the traditional view that advertising for a new product makes people aware of it and then hopefully wins them over (creates positive attitude) such that they either seek it out, or when in a choice situation evaluate it positively. Instead the sales effect is more due to the fact that the advertising ‘opens peoples eyes’, they now have a chance of seeing it in the store, or down the street, or on the webpage. Whereas without the advertising, they would go on noticing and buying their usual brands – they just would not see or recall the brand. Remember consumers don’t see most things in store, and its terribly difficult for new brands to be seen, let alone understood.\n\nAdvertising’s crucial role is in shaping people’s brains so that the brand can be seen.\n\n# Advertising can sometimes persuade consumers",

      "content": "Some advertising creates an intention to purchase by generating a reaction like “I should buy that” or “That’s interesting, I really must check that out”. Some persuasive messages are very dry and rational; for example, classified advertising, directory advertising, search advertising, new product advertising, newspapers and brochures. Typically, directory and search advertising is informative, concise and organised according to the interests of the audience. For example, plumber X guaranteeing a visit within the day to your area might be all the persuasion you need when your hot water system fails. However, to persuade consumers to buy a new product, the market needs to be informed of what is on offer. The excitement of something new provides a window of opportunity: there is enough inherent emotion that an ad (that provides rational information) may get noticed.\n\nHowever, persuasive arguments are more powerful if they include explicit emotional appeals. For example, compare these two appeals:\n\n* _Goodyear tyres grip the road and this means that they reduce your stopping distance._\n* _Today your child’s life may depend on your braking ability. Goodyear tyres reduce your stopping distance and keep your loved ones safe._\n\nPersuasive advertising occurs less than advertising texts and models would have us believe 74. Even in political elections, where one would think that political parties really are trying to persuade voters that their policies and candidates are best, an extremely common advertisement shows nothing more than the name and face of the candidate along with party branding, and maybe a cunningly crafted message along the lines of “vote for X”.\n\nKate ELLIS Labor for Adelaide\n\nAlso, great sales effective advertising does not always need to persuade. In a series of Ehrenberg-bass Institute studies on the forms that advertisements take (FAT) (Mills et al 2000), where the general public, agency professionals and students assessed television and magazine ads, only 40-50% of the assessments thought the ads suggested or claimed that their brand was different or better, or provided helpful information. This suggests there is no simple basis on which these ads could successfully persuade. Others (e.g. Morgan et al 1995; Kay 1993) have also noted that most advertisements contain very little verbal or visual information about the advertised brand.",

      "content": "The persuasion mechanism does not explain most of the advertising in the world. Many brands are already successful. They do not have anything to say that the market does not already know, that a competitor could not say or is meaningful to their buyers. Yet it’s commonly assumed that without persuasion advertising can’t cause sales, but this is not true. Memory structures, even if they don’t result in intentions, still cause sales – decades of research (e.g. Juster 1960) shows that sales can mostly come from people who had no intention of buying. Intentions are memories too, and subject to faulty recall so they are only weakly motivational. A similar point can be made about brand preference or attitude. Some advertising generates a reaction like ‘that’s good’ or ‘that would suit me’. Again, it is commonly assumed that such persuasive advertising must be more effective in generating sales. Such attitudes are usually very weakly motivational. This is partly because they are not often recalled in buying situations and also because we often have a large number of brands we like (and that we buy).\n\nSo it is quite misplaced to conclude that advertising that affects intentions or attitudes works better. This fact undermines much academic research into advertising that has derived rules about effectiveness by examining the effect of advertising exposure on stated intentions (often in artificial laboratory settings with unrealistic lags and heightened attention). Similarly, advertising pre-tests (copy tests) that use intentions or intention shift are biased towards particular types of advertising content, and very often reach incorrect conclusions about the sales effectiveness of particular commercials.\n\nMany companies are trapped in the intentions/preference paradigm. They brief their agencies and evaluate their advertising in line with this model (sometimes without even realising it). Consequently, they produce advertising containing persuasive arguments (often about trivial benefits) that are rejected, misunderstood or ignored by viewers. They also produce advertising that fails to refresh or build appropriate mental structures because management’s attention is on the ad’s selling message. Such advertising fails to communicate consistently the distinctive aspects of a brand. Consequently, many firms produce campaign after campaign where each looks and feels different – as if each were for a different brand.",

      "content": "Somewhat ironically, companies that use this persuasion model of how advertising works will sometimes produce what they call ‘image advertising’ or ‘awareness advertising’, and they do not expect this to produce sales. Of course it should be expected to generate sales – that’s what advertising is for.\n\nMarketers need to understand the memory structures that have already been built for their brand. They need to use these, and ensure their advertising refreshes these structures. Then they need to research what other memory structures might be useful to the brand (i.e. factors driving purchase in the category) and then work to build these. Over decades, leading brands have done stellar jobs at building relevant memory structures. Coca-Cola is a great example. In the past, Coca-Cola was sold in US ‘drug stores’ and so it was associated with drug store visits in summer by teenagers. Today Coca-Cola is associated with a variety of memories: the beach and Coca-Cola, nightclubs and Coca-Cola, pizza and Coca-Cola, parties and Coca-Cola, cafes and Coca-Cola (‘the original long black’), the Coca-Cola bottle, Coca-Cola red, Coca-Cola swirl and so on. These memories make it more likely that Coca-Cola will come to mind; they make it easier for people to notice Coca-Cola and to process Coca-Cola’s advertising.\n\nAs discussed, there are two main ways that advertising works: persuasion (changing opinions) and mental availability (refreshing and building memories). There are other mechanisms, but these are more subtle and are often secondary to salience and/or persuasion. These other mechanisms include bond, status signals and priming, which are discussed below.\n\n# The bond mechanism\n\nSpending money on advertising signals that a company is financially secure and/or their products are good, which is particularly important for services. Corporate reputation advertising is a prime example. The practice of spending large amounts of money on employing top celebrities to appear in ads, or sponsoring large events like the Olympics, is explained by this mechanism. Some consumers infer, perhaps subconsciously, that an advertiser would not foolishly spend lots of money on advertising if it did not have confidence in its product and did not intend to be around for a long time. Also, consumers’ experience has taught them that heavily advertised products and services tend to be good quality.",

This does not mean that advertising has no economic function or that viewers are irrational; rather, viewers respond to signals beyond the explicit messages. The economist John Kay (1993) asserts that most people are inherently cynical about truth in advertising and that they automatically discount claims about quality made in advertisements that cannot be objectively assessed. In this circumstance, he argues (exaggerating somewhat), the only thing advertising can convey is the quality and quantity of the advertising itself.\n\n# Status signals\n\nWhen we use some brands we signal to others, and even to ourselves, what sort of person we are.\n\nAdvertising helps this signalling. Few people drive a Mercedes-Benz, but everyone knows this is an expensive car brand. Advertising tells us this, which means that people who drive Mercedes signal their wealth by driving this brand. This wouldn’t work if the general population didn’t know what a Mercedes looks like and know that it is an expensive brand.\n\nHowever, marketers often over-estimate the effect of signalling. Some categories aren’t very symbolic, and few consumers think a brand will change what their friends think of them. Also, much of the symbolic character of brands comes from usage, observation and word-of-mouth rather than from advertising.\n\nThe implication of this is not that a brand will benefit enormously from advertising that tries to make it cool amongst non-buyers. A more sensible implication is that symbolic brands and even super expensive luxury brands often need to advertise widely. Advertising for luxury watches is not just directed towards billionaires, partly because most people aren’t billionaires and most people who buy luxury watches aren’t billionaires.\n\n# Priming",

Recent research has shown that this effect can apply to exposures that consumers are barely aware of. Research has also revealed that recent exposures to associated cues can enhance the probability of purchase. For example, apparently college students returning to campus after Halloween rated orange brands more favourably and exposure to multiple pictures of dogs increased the probability of ‘choosing’ the Puma brand of sports shoes (because people associate dogs with cats) (Berger & Fitzsimons 2008). This unusual effect isn’t well documented outside of experimental conditions, so it’s unclear how reliable or strong this effect really is in the real world. It is also not clear how competing cues interact and possibly cancel each other out. It’s possible that this exposure effect is simply a salience effect. It is however further evidence that advertising can, at least potentially, affect sales without making a sales pitch.\n\n# Effective advertising\n\nA simple (but not easy) recipe for effective advertising is:\n\n* reach all the category buyers  \n* don’t have lapses in advertising  \n* get noticed, not screened out, by consumers  \n* use clear brand links – a brand’s distinctive assets indirectly brand advertising; mentioning (verbally and/or visually) the brand name is crucial; showing the product and showing the product in use is important  \n* refresh and build memory structures that make a brand more likely to come to mind and be easier to notice  \n* if there is a piece of information that is genuinely persuasive, then say it, so long as it does not interfere with achieving the previous objectives.",

Everything else is secondary. Brands largely compete in terms of physical and mental (brand salience) availability. Even product innovation largely works, when it works, through enhancing mental availability and gaining further distribution. Building mental availability requires reach, distinctiveness (clear branding) and consistency. The brand is seen/noticed, recognised and recalled more often. Building physical availability requires breadth and depth of distribution in space and in time. Together, mental and physical availability make a brand easier to buy for more people, in more situations.\n\n## A new theory of competition for sales\n\nWe have a collection of scientific laws of marketing – law-like patterns that hold very widely and under known conditions (see the complete list of marketing laws on pages vii-viii). These laws can be used to predict and explain marketing patterns, but it would also be useful to have a theory that could weave these laws into a memorable, overarching story that can guide our marketing strategy.\n\n**Table 12.1:** The new consumer behavior model\n\nThis table illustrates a shift in consumer behavior paradigms, moving from a \"Past World View\" to a \"New World View.\" The initial perspective emphasizes \"Attitude Drives Behavior,\" categorizing consumers into \"Brand Loyals,\" \"Brand Switchers,\" and \"Deeply Committed Buyers,\" all influenced by \"Involvement.\" In contrast, the \"New World View\" posits that \"Behavior Drives Attitude,\" redefining consumer types as \"Loyal Switchers\" (appearing twice, suggesting a dual aspect or emphasis), \"Uncaring Cognitive Misers\" who rely on \"Heuristics,\" and \"Emotional Distracted Viewers.\" This presents a comparative structure, contrasting two distinct models of understanding consumer actions and motivations.\n\n**Table 12.2:** The new brand performance model",

      "content": "This theory has to be a new replacement for the twentieth century Kotlerian view of marketing. According to Kotler, competition for sales is about creating differentiated brands that carve off sections of market share by addressing the heterogeneity between consumers. Thus, competing brands sell to different types of consumers; brands have substantially different images; and brand loyalty varies considerably. This view also holds that many brands are niche brands; and that considerable growth is possible by becoming even more niche and selling more to a brand’s most loyal customers.\n\nThis worldview was partly responsible for the very large (and low return) investments in loyalty programs and customer relationship management (CRM) that occurred towards the end of the twentieth century. <sup>81</sup> On a less visible level, this worldview was also responsible for millions of misguided and productivity-sapping marketing plans. Some marketers got lucky and succeeded in spite of their plan <sup>82</sup>, through implementation ‘mistakes’ or from competitors getting it even more wrong. But many misplaced plans did their bit to erode their brand’s customer franchise.\n\nHowever, this twentieth century view of marketing is not completely wrong. It just describes a limited part of the competition for sales. It more aptly describes the competition between product categories than the competition between brands within a category (yet, even in this case it is often an exaggeration). The Kotlerian view doesn’t fit the facts of branded competition; it fails the most basic test of scientific theories: it does not lead to empirical laws. In some cases, it even clashes with these empirical laws (i.e. it predicts different patterns). For example, strong differentiation and differences in brand user profiles would destroy the laws of double jeopardy and duplication of purchase. Yet in the real world we find only minor deviations from these laws. The Kotlerian worldview is not the opposite of reality, but it is a very poor representation of it. It’s similar to the view that the world is flat – it isn’t, though there are flat-ish parts (much of Australia, for instance).\n\nTo understand the new theory of branded competition for sales we need to consider the hectic complicated world of real consumers.\n\n# Busy buyers",

Instead, new technology has squeezed even more into our already busy lives. For example, the global impact of the mobile phone has been dramatic. We used to spend a lot of time waiting for other people. Now, meetings can be replaced with an immediate phone call; waiting for others to arrive is replaced by a call or text message to see where they are; agendas and locations can be changed in minutes. Time is precious, we all only have one life, and it is a human trait to try to do more with the time we have.\n\nFor marketers, this makes the task of getting attention very difficult. On top of this, when people aren’t working they have many more interesting things to think about than brands! I’m not just referring to the really important things in life like family, friends, politics, hobbies, sport and saving the planet. Yahoo US reported that the top search terms for 2008 were:\n\nThis data presents a ranked list of the top 10 most searched terms, indicating their relative popularity. The structure is a simple, linear ranking from 1 to 10. The terms themselves span diverse categories, including celebrities (Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, Angelina Jolie, Barack Obama), entertainment franchises (WWE, Naruto, American Idol), and a video game (RuneScape). This comparative ranking highlights which topics garnered the most online search interest within the observed period, with entertainment figures and events dominating the top positions.",

Over much of the past ten years, Britney Spears has been an incredibly popular search term; she has been the most popular for seven out of eight years last decade (part of Google’s genius was the early work they did to identify all the potential misspellings of search terms like “Britney Spears” so that Google users found what they were looking for<sup>83</sup>).\n\nNo wonder brands employ celebrities and try to piggy-back on their ability to get attention.  \nIn 2013 Bing reported that most searched for person was Beyoncé followed by Kim Kardasian (Barack Obama came tenth) - *plus ça change, plus c’est la meme chose.*\n\n# A cluttered world\n\nOne of the things we are cramming into our lives is more commercial media, and hence more advertising. There are plenty of uninformed reports of massive declines in television viewing, but this just isn’t happening. In general, people are not replacing television viewing with web browsing, YouTube or Social Media – they have simply added new media. People are consuming more media than ever before. In 2005, Ball State University’s Centre for Media Design undertook a large observational study of US consumers and found that (commercial and non-commercial) media consumption (listening, viewing and reading) covered about 30% of people’s waking day, with television still, by far, the most dominant media in terms of both penetration and hours of exposure (in line with the double jeopardy law).\n\nA typical viewer of television – who watches only an hour and a half of television a day<sup>84</sup> – is exposed to more than 60 ads. If a typical viewer also reads one magazine or newspaper he or she will be exposed to anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred more ads. Radio and the internet are also cluttered with advertising, and then there is the general background of advertising seen while walking the streets.<sup>85</sup> Therefore, realistically, a person may be exposed to a few hundred advertising messages per day. This is far lower than the level of exposure disseminated by popular mythology, but this level of realistic exposure is still high considering that people don’t live to consume advertising. Attentively consuming all these ads would take three hours out of a person’s waking day!",

Much advertising receives no active attention whatsoever, or not enough for the receiver to take in which brand is being advertised. Remember the television study mentioned in Chapter 1: a mere 16% of viewers noticed the average commercial and correctly named the advertised brand.\n\n# How consumers cope The typical supermarket stocks around 30,000 products (brands and their variants).\n\nIt seems incredible that consumers can enter a supermarket and leave with their shopping before closing time. How do they find and select brands? Shoppers do it by adopting a number of useful strategies (e.g. heuristics). A very important strategy is that we ‘satisfice’ rather than optimise.[86] Rather than working hard to find the best product for us, we settle for something that we consider good or satisfactory. Some economists rightly point out that such behaviour is optimal, considering the full cost of gaining the necessary information to make a better buy.[87]\n\nBrand loyalty is a natural behaviour that is based on this satisficing strategy. For many different reasons – many of which could be called ‘habit’ or ‘convenience’ – we buy the same few brands over and over again and simplify buying decisions by only noticing our few regular brands. Often we don’t want to make choices; we are pressed for time, or tired, or really just don’t care. We seldom ever want a large selection from which to choose as it’s too difficult. So we restrict our consideration set down to a few favoured brands. Contrary to some popular books (and TED seminars) we are actually very good at coping with lots of choice, we simply screen most of it out (see Scheibehenne 2010).\n\nMarketing theory pays insufficient attention to this coping behaviour. Instead, theories about buyer behaviour are obsessed with brand evaluation. Obsession is a strong word, and yet it is justified because marketing texts instruct their readers to deliver products and services that fulfil customer needs better than other brands; consultants advise brand managers to make buyers emotionally committed to their brand; and market research (from choice modelling to focus groups) is largely concerned with whether or not customers think a brand’s features are the best.",

      "content": "Yet the most important part of any buyer’s purchasing process (i.e. the part that marketers should be the most interested in) occurs almost entirely without being noticed. This part of the process occurs before buyers consciously evaluate which brand to choose: *buyers, in effect, ‘decide’ not to consider the vast majority of brands on the market*. Instead they notice a few and quite often, only one – this underpins their loyalty.\n\nMost brands are effectively ignored, and sometimes no evaluation between brands takes place; for example, if we want a mortgage, we get one from our bank; if we want legal advice, we ring our lawyer; if we want toothpaste, we look for our preferred brand on the shelf. This lack of evaluation and consideration of alternatives can occur even when a consumer is standing in front of a supermarket shelf that is filled with choices.\n\nScreening out is a natural behaviour, people do it all the time; for example, screening out other people talking in the room, screening out advice from parents, etc. Buyers don’t care that there are many brands they do not consider, because the ones they do consider perform well enough. However, it matters enormously to marketers – our brands need to be noticed and considered. Being noticed and considered is often the biggest factor in why a brand is bought or not. Given how small buyers’ consideration sets are, a brand has more than a ‘sporting chance’ of being bought if it is noticed and considered. So, a brand’s sales are primarily determined by how many consideration sets it failed to enter.\n\nSimilarly, in dealing with the vast volume of marketing communication people adopt incredibly capable filtering mechanisms that mean they don’t have to process most advertising. That’s why we can watch an ad over and over and still get the brand name wrong.\n\n# Evaluation is less important than we think\n\nWe don’t notice ourselves not noticing things – it’s a subconscious process. This is perhaps why marketers and academics themselves largely ignore this aspect of buyer behaviour.\n\nBoth academic and commercial marketing researchers work from an evaluation-centred view of buyer behaviour. Billions of dollars are spent on researching brand features and perceptions because these are considered to be the dominant reasons why customers buy or not. This belief is undermined by the following facts:",

Memories are imperfect and variable, as buyers are busy and have limited time to devote to any single purchase (or single market research question).  \n* A buyer only considers a tiny subset of the brands they know; they do not evaluate most of the different feature-bundles on the market. Even for high involvement products like financial services and cars (see Dawes et al 2009; Lambert-Pandraud 2005). Consumers typically know a little bit about some brands and almost nothing about most brands. Customers rarely think about (the features of) these less familiar brands, let alone buy them.\n\n* Which brand a buyer purchases (from the one or few brands they happened to consider on the day) depends on a myriad of factors that relate to the situation and circumstances. Sometimes a buyer is feeling extravagant, frugal, patriotic, etc. Evaluation criteria can, and do, change ‘on the fly’. So any actual evaluation that occurs can vary wildly each time a customer goes to buy.\n\nEvaluation is therefore less important and less predictable than our market research techniques assume.\n\nSo why are some brands much more popular than others? Why, in the US, are many more Fords sold than Renaults? A part of the answer might be that when buyers actively consider both Ford and Renault they prefer Ford – perhaps Ford is better? Yet this is odd because in some markets, like France, Renault outsells Ford. Also, Renault owners throughout the world report similar satisfaction to Ford owners. The main answer to the question is that many more car buyers remember to consider Ford than Renault. In most markets Renault seldom gets a look in. This is not because people dislike Renault or think that it lacks desirable features. It is just that, outside of France, few people think of Renault[^89]. So the big marketing issue is how to get a brand thought of, more often, in more buying situations; in other words, how to build mental availability.",

This phenomenon typically leads to the intuitive, but largely incorrect, conclusion that there must be a large perceived difference between brands. But differences in perceived product features (or brand image/positioning) only marginally explain why one brand is chosen more or less than another. It is screening out behaviour (and physical availability) that largely explains the vast and continuing market share differences that exist between even highly similar brands.\n\nThis suggests a simple prescription: get people to think of a brand. Yet there is nothing simple about this. One of the hardest ongoing battles any marketer faces is to get light, occasional and non-customers to think of their brand. Buyers have too many other more interesting (non-marketing) things to think about. Even brands with plenty of customers still have to fight for customers’ attention. Buyers have so many other things going on in their lives that each category (let alone brand) purchase is trivial. What a battle it is for all the vast number of brands in the market to strive for snippets of attention[^90]. This gives us a major clue into how brands compete for buying occasions.\n\n# How brands really compete\n\nDecades of research into the patterns in buying behaviour and marketing metrics has led to the surprising conclusion that brands compete for custom primarily in terms of mental and physical availability.\n\nBrands that are easier to buy, for more people in more occasions, get bought more often. Brands that have greater market share are better known (and more noticed) by more people and are more widely available. In other words, brands with larger market share have greater physical and mental availability, and also have larger marketing budgets to support these assets.",

As discussed in Chapter 8, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and KFC are differentiated in many ways, not least in that they sell different food (burgers, pizza and fried chicken respectively), yet they compete as fast food brands (with McDonald’s maintaining its advantage of greater mental and physical availability). Each fast food brand sells to the same sorts of buyers (who hold similar attitudes about the brand(s) they use); fast food brands share buyers with each other as if their products are direct substitutes. Indeed, fast food brands spend considerable time reminding buyers of their similarities (e.g. McDonald’s stresses that it offers chicken (burgers) and KFC stresses that it offers (chicken) burgers).\n\nCompetition in terms of mental and physical availability fits the empirical facts observed in all product categories (see end of book for a list of marketing laws):\n\n* Brands within a product category sell to nearly identical consumer bases; each brand’s consumer base varies from the others chiefly in terms of size (i.e. the number of buyers), not in demographics, psychographics, personality characteristics, values or attitudes (see Chapter 5),\n* Buyers of a brand seldom view their brand as being different from its competitors – whether for symbolic, emotional or more prosaic reasons. Buyers very rarely view different brands as being unacceptable. Buyers of different brands express similar attitudes about their brand and similar reasons for buying it. When buyers adopt a new brand their attitudes change in favour of that brand. Buyers simply know and like the brands they buy, and they are vastly more likely to notice, consider and buy these brands over others. Regardless of a lack of differentiation at a brand level or added values, brands have real market-based assets and loyal buyers.",

Therefore, competing brands share consumers; they do so with every other brand in the category, and how much they share depends on the other brand’s market share. For example, all soft drink brands share more customers with Coca-Cola than with Fanta. Also, when soft drink brands gain sales, they steal sales from all the other brands in proportion to the market share of the other brands. Partitions of brands that share more or less of their buyers with each other are weak – all brands in a category compete as if they were close substitutes in spite of their physical or perceived differences. Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke do share buyers more than predicted, but both still share far more of their buyers with Coca-Cola and any other brands with a large market share.\n\nThese empirical patterns show that brands largely compete as branded versions of the product category, with their function, image and price differentiation (within limits) being of surprisingly low importance.\n\n# Mental availability\n\nMental availability or brand salience is the propensity for a brand to be noticed and/or thought of in buying situations<sup>91</sup>. The term brand salience is sometimes used synonymously with top-of-mind brand awareness measures (e.g. the first financial institution recalled when asked, ‘Which financial institutions can you name?’). However, in referring to mental availability we mean more than that. There is a real problem with all brand-awareness measures that assume the link to the name of the product category is all that needs to be measured.\n\nMental availability is based on the network structure in buyers’ memories. For example, memory associations for a bank brand include:\n* a branch near work\n* home loans\n* internet banking\n* friends bank there\n* a branch on high street\n* someone I know worked there * can get cash out\n\n* Visa  \n* my first credit card (and the bike I bought)  \n* the colour, logo, staff uniform, etc.",

      "content": "A simple explanation about how memory works is that memory consists of ‘nodes’ that hold pieces of information. If two pieces of information are associated (e.g. Vodafone and red), links exist between these nodes. Buyers have a network of information (also referred to as brand associations) linked to a brand name. For example, McDonald’s is associated with hamburgers, yellow arches and fast food. These links are developed and refreshed through experiences such as buying and using the brand, being exposed to marketing activities (such as advertising) and hearing about other people’s experiences.\n\nThere are other aspects of memory, such as sensory memory for smell and taste, and the retrieval of emotions such as joy and pain, but they are more often recalled after a brand is thought of. For example, you think of McDonald’s and you have fond memories of your child’s last birthday (or not!); whereas for mental availability we are primarily interested in what makes McDonald’s thought of and/or noticed.\n\nThe more extensive and fresher the network of memory associations about a brand, the greater the brand’s chance of being noticed or thought of in the variety of buying situations experienced by customers. Such memory associations also increase the chance of a brand being selected when multiple options are present.\n\nTherefore, building mental availability is about developing different memory links (that relate to a brand) to increase the scope of the brand-related network in people’s memories – the brand’s share of mind.\n\n# More than awareness\n\nTraditional awareness concepts of recognition and recall are typically driven by their measures<sup>92</sup>, which are invariably single cue measures (i.e. almost always the product category for recall, ‘What brands of power tools are you aware of?’) or the brand name for recognition (‘Have you heard of the brand “Black & Decker”?’). Variations on this theme, like top-of-mind awareness or speed of recall, don’t depart from this practice of using only a single cue. Not surprisingly, these measures crudely capture individuals’ memory structures and poorly predict the frequency that a brand will be noticed or recalled in buying situations.",

      "content": "Mental availability depends on a brand’s share of people’s minds, by which I mean the quantity and quality of memory links to and from a brand. Quantity refers to the number of associations a buyer has about a brand name. Quality has two aspects: strength of association and relevance of the attribute. First, some memory links are stronger than others, in that they are more likely to be activated. For example, for some people, the cue ‘Elvis Presley’ may always bring fried peanut butter sandwiches to mind and vice versa<sup>93</sup>. For these people, this is a strong association – yet for many others this may be a very occasional association. Second, some memory links are more relevant to buying situations than others. Elvis Presley is unlikely to be a cue that people encounter when they are in a position to buy peanut butter. However, this association is not entirely unimportant, as hearing an Elvis song increases the chance of people thinking about peanut butter, and by doing so, enhancing links to cues that do occur during buying situations.\n\nWhen a brand scores well on traditional awareness measures but its sales are disappointing, the common conclusion is that buyers don’t like the brand. However, the problem can be that, while buyers know of the brand (and find it acceptable), they seldom think of it or notice it when they are in buying situations.\n\nBuyers use different cues when retrieving brands as buying options. For example, cues for something to eat in the morning may include something low in fat, something healthy and something quick. Buyers may also use more abstract cues – like colour and the style or size of the packaging – to identify and notice specific brands. They may be totally unaware of the cues they are utilising.\n\nBy building memory links to attributes marketers can increase:  \n* the number of people who think of a particular brand  \n* the number of times each person thinks of a particular brand as an option (to buy).\n\nLinking a brand to attributes means the brand now has some probability to be bought; this is an infinitely higher chance of being bought than when the brand was not thought of at all.",

      "content": "No consumer is wedded to one attribute all the time. This is a common mistake made in segmentation research. For example, rarely is someone always interested in buying something healthy in a product category (or in life!). The typical buyer might be thinking healthy one time, convenient next time and a treat the time after.\n\nBuyers use different attributes at different points in time. Context can matter a lot; for example, ice-creams are more likely to be recalled as a food or treat option at the beach and during holidays. Buyers can also use multiple attributes on a single occasion (e.g. convenient and a treat). The attributes can come from anything relevant to the buying context. So it is necessary for marketers to have a broad understanding of the thought processes that consumers go through before they even think of any brands as options to buy. Researching this isn’t just a matter of asking consumers, because much of this memory functioning is subconscious.\n\n# Cue competitors\n\nDifferent cues also mean that different competitors are likely to be thought of as options by the buyer at any one time. Competitive options don’t even have to be in the same product category. For example, ‘something to wake me up’ can conjure a coffee, or Starbucks, a Red Bull, a Pepsi, a brisk walk, or a swim. When marketers think of competitors they often think of functional look-alikes. However, it is better to think of competitors as ‘cue competitors’. Competitors are all other options linked to the cue, as these are most likely to be thought of and compete for selection.\n\n# The importance of distinctive brand assets\n\nOver time brands build memory structures; most of these are very simple, such as associations with colour, pack shape, fonts and tone.\n\nThese associations are vital because they allow consumers to recognise a brand and its advertising. In other words, associations allow a brand’s communications to do their job of refreshing salience and building new memory structures. Without these distinctive brand assets it is difficult for consumers to digest a brand’s communications. Failure to employ these distinctive elements in communication can also mean that existing customers screen out the communication as they do for the brands that they don’t use.",

      "content": "So the maintenance of mental availability depends on the quality of branding and advertising. Distinctive, consistent icons and imagery build memory associations that allow a brand to be noticed and recalled in a range of buying situations. This is a huge part of brand custodianship, yet it is often overlooked; marketers often fail to deploy a brand’s distinctive assets and, in effect, they sabotage them.\n\n# Physical availability\n\nPhysical availability means making a brand as easy to notice and buy as possible, for as many consumers as possible, across as wide a range of potential buying situations as possible. This includes more than retail penetration, but also presence in store. It includes hours of availability, and ease of facilitating the purchase. Being easy to notice and buy is essential, because buyers do not have strong preferences even for the brands they are loyal to; they are happy to buy alternatives from within their personal repertoires (and they regularly do).\n\nThere is a double jeopardy law that applies to distribution. An extremely reverse-L-shaped relationship between physical availability and market share has been observed using cross-sectional brand data in multiple countries, and across several categories (Reibstein & Farris 1995) and over time for a single brand that rapidly gained and lost share and distribution (Farris et al 1989). Researchers documenting the law have concluded that higher share brands tend to sell more “per point” of retail distribution than their smaller share rivals – an advantage of scale, bigger brands gain efficiencies. There are two things driving this scale advantage, one is that as brands gain very broad distribution they enter areas where they are stocked alongside very few competitors (e.g. convenience stores, vending machines), so the last points of weighted distribution deliver disproportional share gains. The other reason is similar, larger share and more widely distributed brands also are allocated more shelf space in the stores they are in.",

      "content": "However, there is a far more interesting implication of this empirical law-like pattern. It suggests that while high physical availability is an essential requirement for high market share it does not guarantee market share. What we observe is a large number of brands that suffer low market share (low sales). These brands vary greatly in their physical availability, some are in few stores, while some are in nearly all the stores (particularly all of the ones that sell a lot of their product category). Yet irrespective of their physical availability their sales are low. This suggests they are lacking mental availability, or may be very high price or low quality options with limited appeal.\n\n**Figure 12.1:** Example of convex relationship between distribution and sales It is also observed that among the brands with very high levels of distribution there are enormous differences in market share.\n\nThis data visually represents a market share distribution, likely illustrating how different market segments contribute to overall market share. The structure appears to be a comparative or correlational display, mapping a range of market share percentages from 0 to 100 against a scale that also ranges from 0 to 10. The presence of a '+' symbol suggests an additive or cumulative relationship between the two scales, implying that as the value on the 0-10 scale increases, the weighted distribution of market share also increases, reaching a maximum of 100%. The table's layout indicates a direct relationship where higher values on the initial scale correspond to higher weighted distributions of market share.\n\n> *Source: cited in Reibstein and Farris 1995,* _Detergent category in the Netherlands._\n\nSo brands require broad availability if they are to have a chance of high market share, but again it is not guaranteed. Every major consumer marketing corporation in the world has rolled out a new brand (or SKU) with extensive distribution only to see it languish on shelf. Indeed some of these firms will roll out hundreds, even thousands of such ‘innovations’ this year that will sell for only a while on the back of them paying for prominent positions in store, with accompanying promotions and discounts. The lesson is clear, physical and mental availability need to go hand in hand, advertising falls flat when the brand isn’t physically available, and brands sit on shelves when consumers don’t notice them.",

There are offsetting advantages however, as a brand expands its distribution it tends to enter progressively less competitive retail environments (e.g. a vending machine that only stocks your brands) (Farris et al 1989).\n\nI’m surprised how often marketers of consumer goods and services will say, “Oh well, we have practically 100% availability”. They point to their brand’s presence in all the leading supermarket chains, or their national branch network or their web site that can take orders 24 hours a day. None of this comes close to 100% availability. Perhaps the problem is the word “availability”; I don’t mean “available if a consumer is motivated to seek out the product”, I mean readily available.\n\nLike the often reported aim of Coca-Cola to be no more than an arm’s length away. Against a standard like this, it’s easy to see that every marketer has potential to improve the physical availability of their brand.\n\n# How brands compete for sales\n\nIn the long run, brands essentially compete in terms of mental and physical availability. Even product innovation largely works (when it works) by enhancing mental availability and gaining further physical distribution. Building mental availability requires distinctiveness and clear branding, while brands seldom compete on meaningful differentiation. This means that marketing attention should be focused on building these assets so that a brand is easier to buy, for more people and in more buying situations. No marketing activity, including innovation, should be seen as a goal in itself, its goal is to hold on to or improve mental and physical availability.\n\n# Profits that last",

      "content": "One of the things that makes established brands so valuable is that mental and physical availability take a long time to build and a long time to fade. This stability is worth money. Brands, whether large or small, are able to survive, often for very long periods, because they are able to maintain their market-based assets of mental and physical availability. Growth depends on enhancing these assets. Even temporary advantages (such as advances in products or services) can enhance these potentially sustainable assets. Advantages that do not enhance these assets have no long-term value. For example, price promotions, because of their lack of reach, do little or nothing to enhance mental and physical ability, even though such promotions cause increases in sales. When the price promotion ends, everything returns to normal largely because price promotions reach so few buyers, and are particularly poor at reaching new buyers. 94\n\n# Mental and physical availability – a brand’s market-based assets\n\nOver the past twenty years there has been growing appreciation for the intangible assets that underpin the financial value of corporations (Sharp 1995; Srivastava et al 1998).\n\nThese assets can be sold, and they are generally worth far more than a corporation’s tangible assets. Mental and physical availability, and the brand’s distinctive iconography (discussed in Chapter 8) are assets that can be sold. They are brand equity.\n\nThese are market-based assets, in that they come about through trading activity. They are created by marketing. They are assets because they cost money to build, and other companies may purchase them rather than spending the money and time (and taking the risk) to build their own. They are valuable because they provide some surety of future profit.\n\nThese market-based assets deliver productivity. Advertising works better when there are existing memory structures in viewers’ heads – so long as the advertising works with these memory structures. Advertising also works better when the brand has plenty of physical availability. Advertising falls on barren ground when it reaches consumers who aren’t near a brand’s sales points.",

This is very valuable, though it also creates problems in evaluating marketing actions. Every action is moderated by these assets, so marketplace reactions become sluggish. We see this in price elasticities where larger brands have lower elasticities (see Chapter 10); it’s the same for other marketing stimulus like advertising; it’s harder to see anything happening when you turn it on and off. For particularly large, old brands like Snickers (launched in 1930), what they are doing this month advertising-wise pales into insignificance compared to its established mental and physical availability.\n\nTo clearly see or statistically model the effects of a marketing strategy, look at a small brand with little mental and physical availability. In particular, this will show a nice, neat sales reaction to increasing distribution. Measuring marketing is less simple for established brands. 95\n\nWhen marketing support has been absent for a long time for a brand that retains considerable market-based assets, tremendous gains can be made by sprucing up the marketing mix – particularly mental availability in the minds of consumers and retailers. This is one way to make your fortune: find a brand that was popular, with substantial mental and physical availability, but that has been neglected and so has lost much market share. Fix the product quality, or lower the price, start advertising again, and if necessary, work to regain breadth and depth of distribution.",

As the twenty-first century-began, McDonald’s growth in developed countries slowed and it was being regularly criticised for selling unhealthy food. While companies like Subway and Starbucks rolled out stores across the world, it looked like McDonald’s marketers were ‘asleep at the wheel’. In hindsight, it was a terrible blunder to have missed the trend towards drinking espresso-based coffee, which hit America fast as it started to catch up with the rest of the developed world. McDonald’s eventually looked outside its stores and saw that people were eating and drinking (a little) better. So they introduced ‘innovations’ like salads, sandwiches, soft chairs and the McCafe, which served proper coffee. The sales results were superb; McDonald’s bounced back. Nothing McDonald’s did was innovative; it was completely a ‘me too’ catch-up exercise, the sort of thing that is frowned upon by marketing texts. My favourite McDonald’s ‘innovation’ in Australia was the introduction of a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich. This is something that is available at nearly every deli and cafe in the country. McDonald’s didn’t do anything radical; it just got competitive again. But thanks to its existing mental and physical availability it can sell a lot of coffee and toasted sandwiches.\n\nEssentially, McDonald’s took away a ‘reason not to buy’, which was undermining its market-based assets. Remember, much of the marketing battle is to get into the usually very small consideration set; when this happens, which is far less often than any marketer would like, the last thing you want to be is rejected for some reason (e.g. it contains trans fat, is too expensive, too salty, the store is too far, Sarah won’t like it).\n\nLES DOUCEURS DE McDONALD'S POURQUOI RÉSISTER?",

      "content": "A classic example of exploiting neglected, market-based assets occurred near my office in the 1990s. A large wine company, Seppelt, purchased a small, old, run-down Barossa Valley winery by the name of ‘Queen Adelaide’. The Queen Adelaide winery had begun in 1858; its wines had once been popular, but were now mostly seen in dusty bargain bins. The Seppelt winemakers took this brand and combined their modern, quality wine (nothing flash or expensive but clean with clear fruit) with the Queen Adelaide label. Almost overnight, Queen Adelaide became the largest-selling chardonnay in Australia. I don’t think the old Queen Adelaide even had a chardonnay in its range, but chardonnay was now popular and Queen Adelaide was still a very well-known brand. A decent marketing mix and already established market-based assets re-created a big-selling brand very quickly. This gave Seppelt a fabulous financial return on its purchase of a run-down, old winery.\n\nThe Ehrenberg-Bass Institute recently analysed submissions for the advertising effectiveness awards in Australia (similar to the Effies in the US). It’s well known that such awards tend to attract new product campaigns, because it’s easier for them to show the effects of their advertising when they start from sales of zero (and the advertising gets the credit for the success of the new product).\n\nSimilarly, we found that more than half the submissions from established brands were cases of advertising being started again after a very long hiatus.\n\nFor marketers of established brands, everything they do is moderated by the brand’s market-based assets. Their job is not so much to stimulate current sales but to maintain and build the brand’s market-based assets. Such marketers should be less concerned with producing sales blips with short-lived campaigns, and much more concerned with building mental and physical availability.\n\nThomas Bayne, CEO of Mountain View Learning, suggests marketers should adopt a balance sheet-style document to assess their marketing efforts. The balance sheet lists what is most likely to reinforce or build mental and physical availability and what is least likely. Table 12.4 is an example of such a document (to which you might like to add). Remember, any marketing activity that skews to part of the customer base (particularly to the heavier, more loyal customers) is unlikely to build mental or physical availability.\n\n**Table 12.4** Marketing ‘balance sheet’ example",

Strategies very likely to reinforce availability include broadening distribution, gaining new distribution channels, consistent use of distinctive brand assets, consistent advertising, broad-reaching media, gaining shelf space in new store areas, and offering a broad range of product varieties and pack formats. Strategies with low reach, unlikely to reinforce availability, encompass coupons and price promotions, packaging changes, loyalty programs, competitions, and bursting/pulsing advertising. Finally, strategies deemed unknown or risky include advertising with new information, temporary product variants, comparative advertising, and suspense advertising where the brand name is hidden. The structure is comparative, evaluating different marketing tactics based on their potential impact on brand availability.\n\n# What about product and price?\n\nIn the main, the battle for custom is largely about mental and physical availability. Of course product and price matter - especially if they fall behind the competition.\n\nSometimes we have an advantage over many of our competitors and we deliver superior value, but this seldom lasts in competitive markets. Unless we are protected by some government monopoly our competitors notice what we have done and copy us.\n\nInnovation when it works does so by expanding mental and physical availability - and rewards us by letting us earn returns after competitors have nullified our product or price advantage.\n\n# But market research says people buy us because we are [kinder, in tune with women….] ?\n\nLet’s clear up a myth that catches a lot of marketers. Just because some consumers see you as having a particular little difference (e.g. friendlier staff, purpose, ethical stance) doesn’t mean that this is your path to success. Differentiation just doesn’t matter that much.\n\nSay you have a breakfast cereal that has more raisins than other brands. Your market research reports that you achieve somewhat higher (for your brand’s size) on image attributes like “raisins” or “fruity”. And in motivational research consumers who buy your brand say that they do so because they like the raisins. That’s all good and expected. The same can occur if you have spent many years running advertising that stresses raisins. Or it could have been more nuts, or coconut, or fresher ingredients - whatever. Consumers feel like, or remember to feel like more raisins occasionally, just as we sometimes remember we like nuts, and sometimes coconut and so on.",

That’s only sort-of-right but not in the traditional marketing theory sense. If you grow mental and/or physical availability then more people will know your brand has more raisins because more people will be buying it more often - so it will be easier for them to remember your brand has more raisins. And easier for them to remember they like raisins. Trying to convince existing buyers that you have more raisins will do little - they already know what the brand is like. Trying to tell non buyers about the raisins is fine, but in this case it’s largely a talking point to win more mental availability - that’s the real driver of growth (not the persuasive effect of the raisins themselves).\n\nYes you are a bit differentiated, all brands are. But your main marketing battle is to win more mental and physical availability – not to be more differentiated.\n\nNor to convince more consumers that raisins are better than nuts, or fruit, or chocolate, or whatever is in other brands.

      "content": "The marketing world is extraordinarily complex, but textbooks fail us when they suggest that this complexity can never be mastered. As we’ve seen, there are regularities in buying behaviour and sales performance. So it is possible to come up with some simple rules for ‘branded competition for sales’ (i.e. competition to build a sales base with considerable lasting capability). This is, almost without exception, competition between brands (entities whose sales are underpinned by both mental and physical availability). [^96]\n\nWithin this area there are strategic guidelines:\n\n1. Continuously reach all buyers of the brand’s service/product category, with both physical distribution and marketing communication.  \n2. Ensure the brand is easy to buy.  \n3. Get noticed. Often.  \n4. Refresh and build brand-linked memory structures that make the brand easier to notice and buy.  \n5. Create distinctive communication assets.\n\n6. Be consistent, yet fresh and interesting.  \n7. Stay competitive, keep up the mass appeal; don’t give customers reasons not to buy the brand.\n\n## Rule 1: Reach\n\nReach all consumers of the brand’s service/product category, both with physical distribution and marketing communication. All these people are potential buyers of the brand. Examine marketing options in terms of their ability to cost effectively reach as many customers as possible. Avoid strategies that fail to reach non-buyers or light buyers of the brand – most of the brand’s sales potential lies with these customers. Reach across geographical space, time and situations. Avoid going ‘off air’. Avoid narrow descriptions of the brand’s target market that are out of sync with who really buys the brand. Understand who buys, when, and how the brand fits into their lives. Stop talking about your average buyer – there is a wide variety of consumers.\n\n## Rule 2: Be easy to buy\n\nPhysical and mental availability drive market share because they make the brand easier to buy, for more people, in more situations, across time and space. This requires research to appreciate how consumers buy, and how they fit the brand into their lives. You also need to look out for emerging ‘reasons not to buy’, barriers to building penetration like missing pack types or sizes, or prices that are too high.",

      "content": "It’s often flippantly stated that the reason for a particular brand’s high market share is ‘convenience’. This is a shallow explanation; it requires considerable research to work out what convenience is for one product category compared with another. For example, it’s been said that Wal-Mart was initially laughed at in the early 1980s when it built large stores outside of city centres. Some said this was too inconvenient, without appreciating the American trend (of the time) of shopping by car and the convenience of having a large range of merchandise in one location. Similarly, Laura and Al Ries predicted the early demise of the iPhone (“after a short period where Apple would sell quite a few iPhones … to early adopters and elites”). They said it would fail because the convenience of an all-in-one device was over-rated<sup>97</sup>. In 2007 Apple surprised the world by selling one million iPhones in the first 74 days of its release. A year later, the second generation iPhone sold one million units in just two days: the weekend of its launch. Well more than 500 million have now been sold, obviously to more than just ‘early adopters and elites’!\n\nNot far away the tenth birthday of its launch is likely to coincide with the milestone of the billionth iPhone sold.\n\nMarketing ‘gurus’, it seems, often completely misjudge what is, and is not, convenient and important to consumers. I recommend relying on empirical market research to understand what can make the brand easy to buy. Consider how poor so many web sites are, and how poorly laid out so many stores are. This clearly isn’t being given enough marketing attention.\n\n### Rule 3: Get noticed\n\nReaching consumers with advertising and physical distribution amounts to little if the brand is not noticed. Brands that are not seen on the shelf (or not seen when gazing down the street or driving past a store) cannot be bought. Advertisements that are not noticed cannot affect memory structures.\n\nConsumers regularly actively avoid advertising. They use new technologies to do so, as well as old techniques like leaving the room during the television commercial break or flicking past the full-page ad. But even more importantly, consumers don’t pay much attention to the advertising they are exposed to.",

Otherwise how on earth could we be ever be prompted (e.g. distracted) to shift our attention? Our ‘supervisory attentioning system’ (du Plessis, 2005) adjusts our focus from one thing to another, but to do this our brain is processing more than just the object of our current attention.\n\nRobert Heath (2001) has written a book on the fact that advertising can affect memory structures even if it is given very little attention. This is true, but it is still better to gain some attention. Heath argues quite well (although from limited data) that emotionally oriented advertising, in particular, can still work with low attention processing. Heath is on solid ground when he uses this to argue that measures of advertising recall are poor measures of advertising effect.\n\nHowever, Erik du Plessis (2005) points out that one of the primary aims of emotional content in advertising is to gain attention. He draws on considerable empirical evidence showing the link between ad liking and ad awareness. Some years prior to meeting Erik, Dr Rachel Kennedy and I had been making the same argument: that the gentle, if complex, emotional reaction of liking increased the sales effectiveness of advertising , because it encouraged consumers to pay a little more attention.\n\nIn her doctoral work Rachel showed that, in general, ads that were better liked were also more likely to be correctly branded (certainly not less as many advertising agencies assert). She replicated Erik’s COMMAP as a model to explain ad liking (see Figure 12.1).",

This fits with the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance; it also fits with the concept of mental availability that we are better able to process things if they relate to established memory structures (see Rule 4 below); and it fits with extensive research showing that we have implicit and explicit memory. Explicit memories are the memories we are able to retrieve into our consciousness, like remembering that yesterday we went to the beach. Implicit memories can’t be recalled like this, but evidence of their existence shows up implicitly, such as in test performance. For example, people who are exposed to a statement, even if they can’t remember it, are more likely to rate that statement as true than people not previously exposed to the statement. It also shows how we favour the familiar and shows how memory affects our behaviour even when we don’t realise it. Even consumers standing in front of supermarket shelves where all the brands are clearly displayed are being powerfully affected by memories – which brands they actually see is affected by memories. This means we may notice a brand on the shelf, and feel slightly more positive about it, simply because we have seen it more (or its advertising more) without the slightest realisation that this has happened.\n\n**Figure 12.1:** A model to explain ad liking A well-documented psychological phenomenon is that consumers know how often they have been exposed to a brand (i.e.\n\nThis table outlines a framework for understanding brand perception, differentiating between high and low levels of \"L<sub>A</sub>\" (likely a measure of brand familiarity or engagement).

The structure suggests a spectrum of brand impact, moving from positive reinforcement and familiarity to negative confusion and alienation based on the level of L<sub>A</sub>.",

As humans evolved this mechanism was presumably very useful in helping to distinguish between the familiar and unfamiliar and to detect subtle differences (e.g. not as many birds in the forest) that might indicate danger.\n\nAll this means that clever, likable creativity is a way to get advertising noticed. But it is only one way. What we see depends on what is already in our heads; therefore, the following rules matter too.\n\n## Rule 4: Refresh and build memory structures\n\nEven if a brand’s advertising is noticed it can’t work unless it refreshes or creates *useful* memory structures for the brand. This requires understanding what consumers already have in their minds and then working with this, not against it. This is the purpose of brand image research, to understand existing memory structures so that communication can be crafted to reflect them.\n\nIt’s a shame when high-quality, creative advertising fails to do anything for the brand; and yet this happens regularly because the advertising didn’t reinforce or build appropriate memory structures. For example, Miller Lite ran a creative series of ‘man law’ television commercials. These commercials featured an interesting collection of minor celebrities (like Burt Reynolds) who would debate an issue and make a ruling (a ‘man law’). These celebrities ruled on issues like, ‘Is the high five overused?’, ‘If a girl breaks up with your best friend how long do you have to wait before you can ask her out on a date?’ and ‘Are wireless headsets useful or a technology gone bad?’ The advertising campaign attracted much attention: there were web site discussions about man laws, the commercials were posted to YouTube by fans and radio stations mimicked the campaign and held talk-back discussions on their own man laws.",

      "content": "However, the commercials didn’t look like Miller Lite advertising (the humour was more typical of rival brand, Bud), they seldom mentioned beer and nothing about Miller. So what memory structures did they refresh or build? They built the concept of ‘man laws’ and tellingly, nearly every YouTube post described the commercials as the ‘man law’ commercials not the ‘Miller Lite’ commercials. After months of continued decline in sales, Miller dropped the campaign; as Advertising Age wittily stated, Miller decided that market share losses violated man law (Mullman 2007).\n\nFor new brands, the emphasis must be on building the memories that consumers use to buy the brand; for example, what the brand actually does, what it looks like, what the brand name is, where it is sold and where and when it is consumed. These are simple, but essential. Forgetting to tell consumers these things is a marketing sin, as is underestimating how difficult this task will be and how long it may take. With this in mind, simplicity is a virtue. Apple’s iPod is a wonderful example. This MP3 player launched into an existing market where there was already considerable choice in technological product features. Digital compressed music was new, slightly complicated technology. Apple launched a single model, with a distinctive, attractive design and characteristic white headphones. The headphones and the play button were prominent, taping into existing memory structures and explaining what the product did. The brand name, iPod, was simple and distinctive; it communicated ‘new technology’ in a friendly, non-technical manner. And everything was reinforced with the verbal explanation “A thousand songs in your pocket”. Notice that Apple did not mention the term ‘MP3 player’ – their advertising didn’t talk about this new technology at all. The iPod advertising was also extremely consistent, over time and across media. It always employed the same silhouette figures against colourful backgrounds and these figures were always joyfully dancing (while listening to their iPods) and the white headphones were always obvious. Technical details were left to sales people and web sites to explain, where necessary.[^98]\n\nFor established brands (i.e. for most advertising) the need to refresh is paramount. Even Coca-Cola’s marketers have to remind people (not explain) that it’s a refreshing drink especially when you are hot. Building a new memory structure for an existing brand is a long-term project.",

      "content": "It’s not something that should be taken lightly or undertaken often. Each year’s marketing plan should not have a new objective for a new memory structure. Each advertising campaign should largely be saying the same thing. Even when it introduces a piece of new information (e.g. ‘Now in blue’) it should still tell the old story (i.e. work for the brand).\n\n## Rule 5: Create and use distinctive brand assets\n\nBranding matters. Successful businesses have been built by simply introducing branding to a category. For example, Subway recognised that sandwiches were popular throughout the world, and yet there were no branded sandwich shops. What an opportunity sitting under all of our noses! Today, people recognise Subway’s brand when they look down a street or drive past. This recognition allows Subway to out compete the less visible, unbranded sandwich shops (even though many are offering a superior product).\n\nThere are three main reasons why distinctive brand assets (descriptive memories) matter. First, branding allows consumers to be loyal to particular brands and to adopt heuristics like buying ‘their brand’ or ‘the one they noticed’. Without branding, loyalty (which is a natural behaviour) has to be directed to something: else – like a price point, a position on the shelf or ‘whatever is on special’.\n\nSecond, branding lets consumers know which brand the advertising belongs to so that their memory structures are refreshed for the right brand. Without this, advertising cannot refresh memory structures for a brand (in short, it can’t work). The effect is powerful, with consumers who are more familiar with a brand far more likely to notice the brand’s advertising.\n\nBranding is the creation of distinctive brand assets. Mental associations act like coat-hangers: they allow other memories and associations with a brand to hang or form. iPod’s white headphones (earbuds) are a distinctive asset; even by themselves in any ad they say ‘iPod’. The Jolly Green Giant, the M&M characters, PG Tips’ chimps, the Mercedes Benz 3-pointed star, Nike’s swoosh, Mastercard’s ‘priceless’, L’Oreal’s ‘because you’re worth it’, and Puma’s puma logo all do the same.\n\nSome brands have developed a portfolio of assets that are visual, aural and verbal. Some assets are more flexible than others and are more easily used across different media.",

      "content": "These assets allow a brand’s communication to work. A brand’s distinctive imagery isn’t processed deeply with any great meaning; consumers seldom pause to think about a brand’s logo, name, etc.; certainly not the way that ad agency people do. Let me illustrate this with some examples. Hardly anyone has ever thought about why McDonald’s, an American burger chain, has a Scottish name. In Australia there is a successful food brand called Sanitarium (a name not far off sanatorium). In France, Procter & Gamble don’t translate the brand Head&Shoulders into Tete et Épaules; they use the English brand name. Walker’s crisps dominate the UK potato snack category, while Walker’s shortbread is probably the most famous Scottish shortbread brand, yet no-one ever asks if it is the same company. Few people ask what Nestlé means, or what BMW stands for, or what a name like Fannie Mae has to do with financial services.\n\nA brand’s distinctive devices and sounds are processed very quickly by viewers; they are primarily used for recognition, to help work out what is going on and to assist people’s brains to access and file information. This is why distinctive brand assets work. This is branding.\n\nThird, distinctive brand assets are so important because these descriptive memories facilitate a brand being noticed. We are able to see a brand because we recognise its iconography. Given that even in a retail setting when we are looking for things to buy we still don’t notice most things in the store, distinctive brand assets make a brand salient.\n\n**Table 12.5: Examples of distinctive assets**\n\nThis table outlines iconic branding elements associated with three major companies: McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Disney. For McDonald's, key identifiers include the golden arches, sesame seeds on a bun, and the Ronald McDonald clown. Coca-Cola's distinct branding features are its contour bottle, the color red, and a characteristic swirl. Disney's recognizable symbols encompass the castle, Mickey Mouse ears, Tinkerbell, and Pixar's animated lamp. The table presents a comparative structure, highlighting the unique visual and character-based elements that define each brand's identity.\n\n*Rule 6: Be consistent, yet fresh*\n\nA brand can’t be distinctive unless it is consistent.\n\nThe potential longevity of brands is considerable. Compared with the lifespan of companies, or the professional lifespan of managers, brands seem immortal.\n\nThe brands that have dominated for decades have done so by being consistent, not by repositioning.",

      "content": "Too often this is forgotten, and the desire to present something new wins. Similarly, much advertising trips over itself trying to present persuasive, differentiating messages. Consumers are resistant to new ideas, yet they are very happy to be reminded of things they already believe, particularly if it is done in an entertaining way.\n\nA large part of the art of advertising is telling the same story, over and over, but in new and entertaining ways (e.g. the hero saves the day and the bad guy loses).\n\nThe negative binomial distribution (NBD) pattern of buying shown in Chapter 4 is a sobering reminder of why brands need to be consistent. This skewed purchasing pattern is matched by a similar pattern of media consumption and advertising viewing. A few consumers have noticed a band’s advertising, while the vast bulk of the brand’s consumers hardily ever see any – and when they do, it is a long time between exposures. Even the slightest inconsistency is confusing. Not that consumers are often confused by advertising (in the sense of feeling frustrated) – they rarely engage enough with advertising for this to happen. Confusing advertising simply washes over them; they don’t take it in.\n\nPackaging changes are particularly hard on a brand’s legion of occasional buyers. This is why there are so many stories of companies changing a pack and experiencing a sudden and dramatic drop in sales.\n\n### Rule 7: Stay competitive – *don’t give a reason not to buy*\n\nEvaluation is over-rated. Brands largely compete in terms of mental and physical availability. This doesn’t mean that product features, and consumer evaluation, aren’t important – just that they operate within this battle for attention.\n\nWhen people go to buy a brand, a huge part of the selection process (yet a part they hardly notice; they don’t even think of it as part of the decision) is the act of not noticing and/or not considering most options. A buyer evaluates and selects a very limited number of brands – the ones that are noticed or recalled, which often can be a single brand. So while positive features and perceptions help a brand to be chosen, they only do so when they are part of the selection set (i.e.",

This means that advantages in a product’s features, while important, are less crucial than the business press makes out. This is especially true for established brands with significant market-based assets.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that brands that are easier to buy for more people get bought more. Which reminds me that reasons not to buy can therefore be much more important (to sales) than reasons to buy. Generally, marketers are quite sensitive to ‘reasons not to buy’, or at least to negative publicity. Yet it is not uncommon for marketers to spend much effort trying to communicate a ‘reason to buy’ (Value proposition’, USP, differentiating factor, etc.) and yet be quite blasé about features that turn consumers away. For example, many food products still contain trans fat when they don’t need to. In some countries, this means the product has to carry a small warning (like ‘contains hydrogenated vegetable fat’) – you’d think this would be enough to catch their marketers’ attention and concern.\n\nHigh prices can also be another reason not to buy. Too many brands are overpriced and also over-discounted. It’s as if marketers know that the price is too high, so out of guilt they regularly discount the product. A brand should be priced competitively: this doesn’t mean cheap and it doesn’t mean it needs to be given away on special. A competitive price is enough to attract and retain customers. An excessive premium gives customers a reason not to buy, a reason to stop, think and reject the brand. Think about the memory structures that this builds (e.g. ‘I don’t buy this brand!’). An excessive price also encourages retailers to launch a private-label competitor. None of this is fixed by occasional discounts.\n\nIt’s very difficult to get consumers to notice a brand; when marketers succeed in this, consumers reward the brand with a degree of loyalty (largely due to habit and inertia). However, this can be ruined if they suddenly notice a reason not to buy. Marketers should always be on the look out for such barriers. This is one of the reasons that differentiation needs to be approached with caution: being different and appealing to one group in the market can turn consumers away.\n\n# A final word on how to grow",

      "content": "There are only a few key strategies to grow a brand. You can lower the price (and sacrifice profit margins), but this is self-defeating because the reason a brand wants to grow is to improve sales revenue and margins not reduce them.\n\nYou can improve the quality of the product or service for the same price, but this also negatively affects profit margins. Essentially, these two strategies are similar and not attractive. Everyday brand managers are trying to reduce costs and improve quality to stay competitive – usually that’s about as far as you want to go with this strategy.\n\nThe other way to grow a brand is to invest in market-based assets – to improve the brand’s mental and physical availability. However, simply spending more on advertising will have similar results to the strategy above; it will cut your profits and there may be little to show for it afterwards. The trick is to make an investment that builds the brand’s assets, so that in future the marketing budget gets a greater return. That means better advertising and marketing. Building a distinctive memory structure achieves this; it enhances all future advertising (remember it is much easier to refresh existing memories, so advertising for brands that have distinctive elements embedded in people’s minds suffers less from brand ambiguity). Obtaining new physical distribution has a very similar effect; again advertising and other marketing efforts work better if a brand is more widely available.\n\nThe third option to stimulate a brand’s growth is to innovate and bring new or improved, desirable features to the marketplace. However, such advantages seldom last long, so it is important to ‘make hay while the sun shines’ and work fast to use the advantage to build penetration and enhance the brand’s market-based assets. New or improved features are something to talk about; they attract attention and generate publicity. Unfortunately, a lot of ‘innovation’ is not exciting or newsworthy.",

It’s just that there are scientific laws about a brand’s level of loyalty (in the same way as there are laws for gravity), and the double jeopardy law says that a brand’s loyalty metrics won’t rise unless it substantially increases its penetration (and thereby market share).\n\n### Is nudging someone from one purchase to two increasing their loyalty?\n\nYes exactly. And someone moving from buying once a quarter to twice a quarter is the same, this means that they now add to the brand’s quarterly penetration every quarter, whereas before they did so only every second quarter.\n\nWhen a brand successfully nudges the market’s buying propensity (their loyalty for the brand) it shows up as a large change in penetration and a small improvement in loyalty metrics because most people don’t buy very often.\n\nDouble Jeopardy tells us that loyalty marketing goals that assume large changes in a brand’s loyalty metrics are misguided. And that targeting existing heavier more loyal customers is not a good growth path.\n\n### What about small brands?\n\nThe scientific laws apply to large and small brands, service brands, B2B brands and so on. I’ve used a range of examples to try to show this.\n\nAnd I deliberately used Coca-Cola to illustrate the Negative Binominal Distribution (NBD) in chapter 4, because if that’s what the customer base of such a giant brand looks like then it’s not hard to see that small brands face the same sort of situation – most of their buyers buy very infrequently, and most people don’t buy them at all, so reach is essential.\n\n# What about large brands that already have high penetration?\n\nHow can a brand grow penetration if it already has near 100% penetration? Well, no brand has an absolute penetration metric, it depends on the time period. Brands with 70% or more penetration **in a year** will have vastly lower penetration in a quarter or month. Underpinning such metrics is the same NBD distribution seen in chapter X. All brands, even a huge brand like Facebook has mostly very light users, and plenty of non users (especially in a quarter or a month). So, again, reach is essential.\n\n# Is everyone who buys the category in our target market?",

With due consideration of your current physical availability, if you aren’t available in the North of the country then category buyers who live in the North fall, somewhat, outside of your target.\n\n# So if we have multiple brands or SKUs in the same category then they have the same target market?\n\nYes, which makes life much more simple, and can potentially save a great deal of money in not needing to undertake market research looking for differences. There is nothing wrong with your brands targeting identical markets - see “Implications for brand portfolio management” in chapter 6.\n\n# How can we make interesting, distinctive advertising if our target is everyone?\n\nBy employing a capable advertising agency. This is what great advertising does, it resonates with a broad cross section of people, it taps into our commonality as human beings. Disney is a fabulous example of this, it has crafted stories that appeal to people of different age, culture, race, religion and so on.\n\nResist the urge to admit defeat and retreat to concentrate on small winnable battles (e.g.\n\nsocial media campaigns based on ‘earned media’ that only reach heavy buyers). Resist customising your advertising unless you can see clear return for low cost – for example, global brands usually translate their ads into different languages.\n\n# Isn’t it expensive to try to reach light buyers?\n\nThis is a myth that holds marketers back.\n\nReaching millions of light buyers was the same challenge that faced marketers in the 20th Century and thanks to the emergence of mass media and national retail chains they were able to build brands, even global brands. Mass media and retail chains still exist, and are becoming increasingly global. They offer marketers great efficiency. In developed countries it still costs only around 2 cents to reach a person with a 30 second video using TV, in many countries it is far cheaper than this even. Today in the 21st Century we are in the golden age of mass media and mass distribution, and marketer who realise and exploit this will do very well.\n\n# Our commercials always features women, but we know that men make up a large chunk of our buyer base - should we change our advertising?",

But don’t assume, research your distinctive assets, check if the women in your advertising are an important part of your branding or not, and check if you are reaching and resonating with men or not.\n\n# Market partitions are just another name for segments aren’t they?\n\nNo, partitions are groups of brands that compete more directly with each other, and less directly with other brands in the category. Partitions may relate to different types of people (segments), for example sweeter breakfast cereals sell more to households with children, but such links may not always be obvious or of any practical consequence.\n\nIt’s important to remember that partitioning, while common, is usually slight. That’s why we call them partitions, not separate markets. They often require no marketing reaction, for example just because there is a partition does not mean you need to have a separate SKU or brand to service it, your existing brand may already compete very well in that partition as well as the rest of the market.\n\n# How can a new brand build mental availability when it has no distinctive assets?\n\nIt’s very difficult as everyone knows. My first advice is to follow the guidelines in this book closely, it’s risky enough launching a new brand there is isn’t the luxury of ‘breaking the rules’. There will be certain memory structures that have to be planted in consumers’ heads or they simply won’t notice the brand, don’t forget these in your efforts to tell people how wonderful your new brand is – stick to the fundamentals. See rule 4 in chapter 12.\n\nA brand with no distinctive assets has to build some. One shortcut is to work with what already exists in people’s heads, that is, borrow memory structures where you can.\n\n# Should a brand seek to build mental or physical availability first?\n\nBoth work together, physical availability is of little value if consumers don’t notice the brand, and advertising is of little value if the brand is physically difficult to obtain. This is one advantage of big brands, their advertising works better because of their wide physical availability, and their physical availability is supported by efficient mass media.",

However, there is mounting evidence that changes in consumer behaviour have been far more modest than ‘experts’ predicted. All the talk of ‘frictionless commerce’, perfect information, the death of brands has turned out to be as good as predictions of flying cars.\n\nTen years ago we told our Ehrenberg-Bass Institute sponsors that predictions of the death of TV were ridiculous, as we showed predictable patterns of TV viewing (scientific laws) that had held through massive social and technological change, and continued to hold.\n\nSince then TV viewing has not declined, in fact it has increased!\n\nMeanwhile the advertising performance of many new media has turned out to be far less impressive than expected. Some, like Facebook, offer the potential of great reach in the sense of OTS (opportunities to see) but have turned out to be far less able to actually reach the brains of consumers which seem to be distracted by talking to their friends than viewing our advertising.

Branding lasts, differentiation doesn’t.\n\n### Thou Shalt Differentiate\n\nTextbooks emphatically tell marketers that differentiation must be the centrepiece of their marketing strategy:\n\n> “if marketing is seminally about anything it is about… differentiating … All else is derivative of that and only that” (Theodore Levitt)  \n> “differentiation is the cornerstone of successful marketing” (Philip Kotler)  \n> “the differentiation must be meaningful to customers … if a brand fails to differentiate then consumers have no basis for choosing it over others” (David Aaker)  \n> “without differentiation a loyal customer base cannot be created or sustained” (David Aaker)\n\nAll of the above quotes are wrong.  \nAs is this one: “Differentiate or die” (Jack Trout)\n\nPractically every university marketing textbook is called something like *Marketing Management* or *Marketing Principles*, while almost every consumer behaviour textbook has the title *Consumer Behaviour*. The chapter headings in these books are also strikingly similar.\n\nThese books hardly ever disagree with one another. Ironically, they are a very poor example of the differentiation they preach – textbook authors don’t seem to take their own advice.\n\nIn spite of nearly every textbook telling marketers to strive for differentiation, real world competition is largely about competitive matching rather than avoiding competitors by delivering differences. Furthermore, textbooks offer no evidence that differentiation leads to brand growth or profitability. This doesn’t mean that there aren’t meaningfully differentiated brands that are growing and profitable, but the empirical fact is that most category leaders have a great many very similar rivals.\n\nEvery category has some brands (or variants) that are more expensive and higher quality. Sometimes there are brands that are vastly more expensive – but these up-market brands face many similarly high-priced competitors within their sub-category. Some brands are a bit faster, a tad sweeter, a touch more stylish, slightly trendier or provide a marginally better service. Yet, there is not much difference between them, and it’s surprising how many similar brands a market will support. This leads to two interesting questions[^56]:\n\n1. Can advertising imbue brands with special values? (In other words, can marketing differentiate functionally similar brands?)\n2. Do buyers need to perceive a meaningful difference to regularly buy a brand (i.e. to show a preference and/or loyalty)?",

      "content": "The answers to these two questions strike at the heart of much modern marketing thinking and practice. The answers interest both practising marketers and their civic-minded critics. It’s time empirical science was applied to these questions.\n\n# Special values\n\nOne explanation for the plethora of rival brands that exist is that advertising has imbued each brand with a different perceived meaning that consumers value.\n\nMarketers routinely measure brand perceptions. Sometimes for very practical reasons, for example, they want to find out how many people know their store is open on Saturday, or whether women perceive them differently to men. However, today it’s common for marketers to measure more esoteric perceptions, like whether consumers imbue the brand with human personality traits.\n\nA significant amount of brand management time is spent developing huge batteries of highly subjective perceptual cues to measure. 57\n\nThe data that such image (brand health/equity) surveys generate are often subjected to multivariate statistical techniques, or the even more obscure proprietary analyses that many market research agencies peddle. These are typically designed to highlight differences between brands, but usually fail to convey how big these differences really are – or how they relate to actual buying behaviour. By now this might strike you as odd (and not good practice), given that we saw previously (in Chapter 5) that buyers of one brand perceive that brand in much the same way as buyers of rival brands perceive their brand – the ‘I love my mum’ pattern.\n\nBigger brands have many more customers (see Chapter 2), and so they have more people who are likely to respond to an image survey question. Consequently, larger brands tend to score higher on any image question, because they will have more customers among the survey respondents. Their buyers are also slightly more loyal (i.e. they buy more frequently), which enhances their propensity to think/say things about the brand. So, even in survey data that only reports on the perceptions of each brand’s buyers, brands with larger market share will score higher.",

What is not well known – or is rarely discussed by market researchers – is that once the usage effect is removed there is little sign of brands having unique images. For example, Table 8.1 lists the percentage of respondents (who are familiar with a brand) who associate a brand (e.g. FedEx) with a particular image attribute (e.g. trusted). This data was published in a market research journal (Whitlark & Smith 2001) to show how complicated image data are supposed to be. However, Professor Martin Collins (2002) subsequently showed that if you are familiar with the law-like patterns you can ‘see the wood for the trees’ without complicating things with multivariate statistics. In Table 8.1, brands are simply ranked in order of the number of respondents who were familiar with them, it’s only a rough proxy for usage, yet the ranking still produces the sort of patterns seen when only users of each brand have their perceptions measured. These main patterns are:\n\n* Some attributes always score higher than others (e.g. more than 90% for ‘trusted’ compared with only 30% for ‘essential’). 58\n* All brands gain very similar scores – with a slight double jeopardy sub-pattern (i.e. smaller brands score slightly lower).\n\nTherefore, all brands are seen in much the same way by those familiar with them. Even small brands get a similar endorsement from their few buyers.\n\n**Table 8.1:** Association of brands with attributes\n\nThis table presents a comparative analysis of seven companies (FedEx, A, Nokia, B, C, Oracle, D) across seven attributes: Trusted, Efficient, Rapport, Relevant, Solution, Innovative, and Essential. Each company is assigned a score for each attribute, with a final 'Average' score calculated across all attributes. The data is structured to allow for direct comparison of company performance on individual attributes and their overall average standing. A final row provides the average score for each attribute across all companies, offering a benchmark for evaluation. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences and similarities in how these companies are perceived across the defined attributes.\n\n*Source: Collins 2002.*\n\nOnce these patterns are known, it is easy to spot the few exceptions; for example, Nokia and Oracle (two technology brands) are considered more ‘innovative’.

Perceptual surveys are still useful – they are just far less deterministic and mysterious than they are typically portrayed. Their utility lies in marketers using them to ensure that all their advertising is truly branded (i.e. to look like you, you need to know how the market already sees you).\n\n# Brand personality\n\nIt’s very difficult to find exotic image attributes (i.e. not related to obvious functional features) that substantially differentiate rival brands. Brand personality is a recent attempt. Long ago, marketing researchers began investigating the impact of a buyer’s personality on their brand choice. This was quickly shown to be inconsequential. The famous study into Ford versus Chevrolet buyers by Franklin B Evans was one of the first to challenge this notion: the study found no difference in the personality traits of the different brand buyers (Evans 1959).\n\nHowever, personality researchers persisted. The goal became to identify the human personality a brand is reflecting. Interest in brand personality heightened with the publication of Jennifer Aaker’s (1997) ‘brand personality’ scale, which measures the human characteristics that consumers associate with brands, such as charm or ruggedness.\n\nHowever, it turns out that personality perceptions are like all other image attributes (i.e. users of different brands see their respective brands in much the same way). But brand personality perceptions score very poorly – it turns out that consumers are reluctant to view brands as people (i.e. only 5% think brand X is rugged)<sup>59</sup> – see Romaniuk & Ehrenberg 2012. These perceptions, that are weakly held by the population, are also weakly held by individuals (of the 5% who think the brand is rugged in one interview, only about a quarter of these people (about 1%) will repeat the assertion when re-interviewed). Yet a number of marketers adopted the brand personality concept without asking for such empirical evidence first – like medieval doctors (see Chapter 1).\n\n# Unique associations",

      "content": "If brands were really differentiated in the minds of consumers, we might expect successful brands to have unique image attributes (i.e. consumers associate an image with only one brand). It’s long been argued that brand equity rests on strong and unique associations. But a thorough examination of the image data of 130 brands in 13 product and service categories shows that people rarely (about 3% of the time) see a single brand as being exclusively associated with a particular image (Gaillard & Romaniuk 2007). More successful brands do not have proportionally more unique associations, nor do customers with greater preference for a brand hold more unique associations than those with less preference. Instead, the level of brand uniqueness – as designated by the proportion of associations customers hold for one brand only – has been shown to be simply negatively correlated with the number of brands in the category. A brand is more likely to be perceived as the only brand with a particular quality if it has few competitors.\n\n# Meaningful differentiation\n\nDifferentiation is deemed to be an essential part of marketing strategy. It is taught more like religion than hard-nosed business. Differentiated brands are supposed to inherit all the customers and profits; it’s all or nothing and we are told we must ‘differentiate or die’ (Trout & Rivkin 2000).  \nMarketing texts use a motivational perspective – they talk of a meaningful, perceived difference that provides buyers with their reason to purchase and be loyal to a brand (Aaker 2001; Kotler 1994). Undifferentiated new entrants to a market are supposed to be likely to fail because no customer is motivated to buy them (Davidson 1976).\n\nIt is believed that established brands need to maintain their point of difference in order to stay desirable to their customers. Breakthroughs in perceived differentiation – achieved either through product features (e.g. Apple’s original, candy-coloured iMac) or image-building advertising (e.g. Marlboro man) – are seen as pathways to growth.",

      "content": "The marketing literature explicitly states that a brand’s differentiation has to be perceived by customers and must be valued. This valued difference doesn’t have to be a product feature, and can be symbolic or emotional. Some marketing texts even suggest that a brand’s differentiation can be based on what, in reality, are meaningless product features, such as Folgers ‘flaked coffee crystals’ (Carpenter et al 1994) – so long as these features are noticed, believed and valued by consumers. Perception is reality, as many marketing commentators point out. Others like Kotler and Aaker are emphatic that the difference must be meaningful to consumers.\n\nThe advertising principle of promoting a ‘unique selling proposition’ (USP) (Reeves 1961) reflects this theory. Advertising that does not give buyers a reason to buy the product is thought to be ineffective. Although, a few have challenged this orthodoxy by arguing that advertising can work effectively without a USP or a means of persuasion (see Chapter 9).\n\nYet, in spite of these strong beliefs, or perhaps because of them, very little is known about brand differentiation. Consider these questions:\n\n* How different are brands perceived to be?\n* Do buyers need to perceive a meaningful difference to repeatedly buy a brand?\n* Are some brands far more differentiated than their rivals? Does this mean their buyers are more loyal? Are these brands more profitable? Are they growing faster?\n\nIn spite of all the marketing books that preach differentiation, they offer scant evidence to answer these basic questions.\n\n# Real world differentiation\n\nThere are very good reasons to doubt the textbook theory of differentiation. Much of the empirical evidence that is presented in this book does not sit well with the theory.\n\nIn the real world differentiation undoubtedly exists. The idea that brands are identical commodities is fiction; for a start, they have different names that can be used by buyers to develop loyalties and show preference[^60].

      "content": "These situational differences affect all brands; this means that they all enjoy some differentiation. But is there also differentiation at the brand level? Do some buyers (across time and buying situations) see and value a difference?\n\nThe first thing that should make us question the importance of differentiation is that loyalty does not vary much between rival brands (see Chapter 2). Loyalty definitely exists, but it is a characteristic of consumer behaviour, rather than being driven by brand differentiation. This means that all brands should benefit from loyalty. But if there is substantial differentiation at the brand level, then why doesn’t loyalty differ much between brands? Why are niche brands, with small but highly loyal customer bases, not commonplace?\n\nThe second thing we should consider is that if brand-level differentiation is strong then a brand should appeal more to a particular type of person who particularly values the brand’s style of differentiated offer. Yet, as discussed in Chapter 5, brand-user profiles don’t differ much – competing brands in a category sell to very similar customer bases (Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2001a). Brands with vastly different prices (and quality) have different user profiles; expensive brands tend to be bought by wealthier people. But within their competitive set, the brands’ user bases are similar: Versace’s buyers are similar to Gucci’s, and Nike’s buyers are similar to those who buy Adidas’s.\n\nDifferentiation theory suggests there should be a great deal of market partitioning (where brands share more or fewer customers than they would be expected to according to their respective market shares).\n\nBrands that are very differentiated from one another should share very few customers; brands that are positioned in a similar manner should share many customers. Yet the widespread fit of the duplication of purchase law, which states brands share customers with other brands in line with their relative shares, shows that partitioning is generally slight (see Chapter 6).\n\nIf brands vary in their degree of differentiation, we might expect to see them exhibit different price elasticity, as customers of more differentiated brands would be less sensitive to price. However, price elasticity seems to vary more with the context of the price change (see Chapter 10). This again suggests that brands within a category have similar levels of differentiation.",

This model effectively assumes that brands compete as undifferentiated choice options of varying popularity. The real world conforms to this model, with the NBD-Dirichlet successfully predicting a wide variety of brand performance metrics in dozens of product categories, different countries and across time (Ehrenberg, Uncles & Goodhardt 2004).[^61]\n\nBlue owl sitting on a branch\n\nEvery category has brands that differ in price and quality (referred to as ‘vertical differentiation’ by economists). Sometimes a category contains brands that are vastly more expensive than the other brands in the category. This price difference shows up in the dissimilarity of the different (i.e. cheaper and more expensive) brand’s user bases. The price difference is also exhibited in the more expensive brand’s departure from the duplication of purchase law and NBD-Dirichlet benchmarks. The fact that this evidence is not often seen for other brands suggests weak levels of differentiation at best.[^62]\n\nThis body of theory and empirical evidence does not support the traditional role of differentiation presented in much marketing literature, nor does it support a ‘perfect competition’ (commodity) model. Differentiation undoubtedly exists, but empirically grounded theory suggests differentiation is best thought of as a category level (rather than brand level) phenomenon. In summary, differentiation theory is like the neo-classical, economic, perfect competition model, in that it describes an abstract ideal world and not the one that real brands compete within.\n\n# Icon brands",

      "content": "It’s not just the buying of everyday, run-of-the-mill brands that causes the patterns reported above. These laws also apply to ‘icon brands’, which are brands that are supposed to represent the height of marketing excellence and consumer bonding. For example, Nike is considered (by the CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi, Kevin Roberts (2004, pp. 78-9)) to be a Lovemark brand, which is a brand that inspires ‘loyalty beyond reason’. Yet an analysis by Dr John Dawes (2009) clearly shows that Nike conforms to the double jeopardy law and the duplication of purchase law: Nike’s buyers are not 100% loyal; they give it no more loyalty than it should receive given its market share (i.e. Nike’s receives less loyalty than Adidas in some markets). Nike sells to the same sort of people as other sports brands, to similar demographics, social classes and psycho-geo-demo-graphics (see Dawes 2009). These patterns in real buying behaviour raise serious questions about the degree to which buyers perceive rival brands to be different.\n\n# Perceived differentiation\n\nSo how do buyers choose between branded options? Do buyers need to perceive that the brand they are purchasing is different? Do they need another reason to buy the brand (other than offering the benefits of the category, e.g. it tastes like ice-cream or it works like a credit card)? Systematic study across product and service categories, countries, survey methods and questions types reveals two robust patterns:\n\n1. Buyers of a brand perceive very weak differentiation – yet this does not stop them loyally buying that brand.\n2. A brand’s level of perceived differentiation is very similar to their rivals.\n\nFor example, Table 8.2 reports the proportions of brands’ regular buyers who agree that the brand they buy is different or unique.\n\n**Table 8.2:** Brand user perceptions of differentiation in the soft drink (UK) and banking (Australia) categories",

For soft drinks, brands like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Pepsi-Cola, Fanta, Pepsi Max, Schweppes, and Canada Dry are evaluated. Pepsi Max and Coca-Cola show the highest \"Either (%)\" at 19%, indicating a combined perception of being different or unique. Banks, including ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac, and St George, are similarly assessed. St George stands out with the highest \"Either (%)\" at 32%, suggesting a strong perception of being either different or unique compared to competitors. The averages reveal that, across the board, banks (18% \"Either (%)\") are perceived as more distinct or unique than soft drinks (16% \"Either (%)\"). **Source: Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.\n\nSee also (Romaniuk, Sharp & Ehrenberg 2007)**\n\nAll the markets we have examined, whether using our own or others’ data, follow a similar pattern: an average of 10% of any brands’ users think their brand is different. It could be that these responses reflect apathy when responding to research questionnaires; however, there are three indicators that this is not the case.\n\nFirst, within the markets there were exceptional brands that had obvious functional differences. For example, Aldi supermarkets, which do not stock national brands, scored 67% for “different”; while in the fast food category, sandwich-only brand Subway achieved 50% for “unique” when put in a competitive set with McDonald’s, Domino’s and KFC. So respondents could indicate when something was perceived as differentiated. However, most brands were seldom perceived as such.\n\nSecond, the results show expected differences between markets; for example, soft drinks are more differentiated than water. Spirits and skincare – two categories we deliberately chose because they are considered to be highly image driven and supported by vast amounts of brand advertising expenditure – both showed among the highest levels of perceived differentiation (although still low).\n\nAnd, third, other perceptual metrics in the same surveys obtained far higher scores.",

The average score was 2.5: few brands scored higher than the neutral midpoint of 3, and none had a mean as high as 4 (a score that would indicate respondents somewhat agreed the brand was different). Therefore, our finding that consumers hardly see their brands as differentiated is consistent across both a pick-any or a rating scale measure.\n\n<sup>63</sup>  \nThere were some systematic deviations from this general pattern, where brands consistently obtained higher response levels. This was for small, higher-priced brands. This is consistent with the notion that more differentiated brands will be smaller, or, less popular brands are seen to be different. There were also some brand-specific deviations; however, these tended to be linked to large functional differences and less to image differentiation. So the majority of buyers do not explicitly state that they perceive their brand to be differentiated from other brands. Therefore, it is questionable whether perceptions of brand differentiation drive buyer behaviour. Buyers don’t need to see differentiation to buy a brand, or to keep on buying it.\n\n**Table 8.3:** Examples of category level results\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of consumer perception across various product categories, specifically focusing on how current users perceive differences and uniqueness. The categories are evaluated based on the percentage of users who believe the category is different, unique, or either different or unique. Spirits show the highest perception of difference (20%) and uniqueness (27%), leading to the highest combined perception of 36%. Conversely, Electronics and Water exhibit lower perception rates across all metrics, with Electronics at 4% for difference and 6% for uniqueness, and Water at 6% for both. Other categories like Supermarkets, Skincare, and F&V drinks fall in the mid-range, with varying degrees of perceived difference and uniqueness. The overall average across all categories indicates a moderate level of perceived distinction, with 11% of users seeing categories as different, 10% as unique, and 17% as either.\n\n*Source: Romaniuk, Sharp & Ehrenberg 2007.*",

Apple’s level of perceived differentiation is higher than other computer brands, but it is not high.\n\nMost (77%) of Apple users did not perceive their brand to be different or unique. This seems surprising, given that Apple computers look different and use a different operating system<sup>64</sup>. However, most computer users have little technical knowledge and few would know what an operating system was. Apple Macintosh is a personal computer (PC), with a graphical user interface, a mouse and keyboard, it runs software (e.g. Microsoft Office), sends email, surfs the web, stores files, prints and so on. It is not unreasonable that its users see it as doing very much the same things as other computers. They certainly buy it to do the same things. Few apparently bought it because they wanted a computer that was different; they bought it to be a good useful computer – just as buyers of any other computer brand.<sup>65</sup>\n\n**Table 8.4:** Computer brand users’ perceived differentiation\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of user perceptions across six different computer brands: HP, Toshiba, Compaq, IBM, Apple, and Dell. The analysis focuses on three key metrics: the percentage of users who are \"Different\" (likely referring to users who are not loyal or are considering switching), the percentage of users who are \"Unique\" (potentially indicating a distinct user base or preference), and the percentage of users \"Associating the brand with either\" (a measure of brand recognition or positive association). Across all brands, the average percentage of users in these categories are 9% for \"Different,\" 10% for \"Unique,\" and 14% for \"Associating the brand with either.\" Apple exhibits the highest percentage for \"Unique\" users (25%) and for \"Associating the brand with either\" (27%), while IBM shows the highest percentage for \"Different\" users (16%). Dell consistently shows the lowest percentages across all three metrics, with 5% for each category. The structure is comparative, highlighting variations in user perception for each brand against a set of defined metrics.\n\n*Source: Y&R, BAV (Brand Asset Valuator), 1999.*\n\n*Note: Only a quarter of Apple users think the brand is either different or unique.*",

      "content": "Many marketing texts instruct marketers to strive to make customers perceive valued differences between brands. Yet even marketers of highly successful brands seem to have failed. This leads to the conclusion that perceived differentiation plays little part in the success of brands. It is certainly not a case of ‘differentiate or die’; if it were, most of the brands we buy would be gone.\n\nThe literature on consumer behaviour has for decades focused on customer perceptions of brand features as the main reason why one brand is chosen over others.\n\nThis emphasis is misplaced. If buyers of a brand don’t often think their brand is different or unique, then presumably this is not the main reason they buy it. We need to look elsewhere for explanations of why customers buy one brand and not another.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive that buyers do not often notice that the brands they use are somehow different from other brands in the market (given that some of the brands are functionally different).\n\nThis shows that brand choice is a trivial task, as is the choice of deciding whether or not to buy from the product category. So buyers do not spend a great deal of time comparing brands in a category, and so differentiation (relative to other brands) is not noticed. This realisation is counter to many models of information processing; buyers are thought to weigh up brands on the merits of their relative attributes (e.g. Alpert 1971; Fishbein & Ajzen 1975; Green, et al 1981), which implies that buyers know about the differences between brands. However, what empirical evidence shows is that buyers seem to know something about the brands they use, and very little about the ones they don’t. This results in the much lower response levels from non-users (compared to that of users).\n\nThe main implication is that it isn’t essential for marketers to convince buyers that a product is different before they buy it. This should take a considerable weight off marketers’ shoulders, because our data shows that such a task must be near impossible. Instead, marketers should focus on achieving the things that do make customers buy a product.",

Consider three brands that are clearly functionally different (and maybe different in other ways too): Pizza Hut, McDonald’s and KFC. Respectively, they sell pizzas, burgers, and fried chicken. So we should expect that McDonald’s primarily competes with other burger providers (Wimpys, Burger King, Hungry Jacks, Carl’s Jr, etc.); that Pizza Hut competes with other pizza chains (Dominos, Pizza Pizza, Little Caesars, Papa John’s, Pizza Haven); and that KFC competes with other chicken outlets (Harold’s Chicken Shack, Bojangles, Oporto, Chesters, Red Rooster etc.). According to textbook logic, McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut would not compete against one another (or very indirectly). Of course this is nonsense; they are direct competitors; they compete in one big fast food category. Rather than working to differentiate themselves and splinter this fast food category, they actually try to reduce their differentiation; for example, McDonald’s advertises that it offers chicken (burgers), KFC advertises that it offers (chicken) burgers and Pizza Hut advertises that it sells chicken (pizza).

Or put another way, on average 82% of people who find the brand acceptable to buy will NOT endorse that it is “different from other brands in the category”. For the technically minded, that average of 18% is based on a skewed distribution. A few brands score quite high (e.g. expensive, high quality brands or very cheap poor quality brands), but most will be less than the average. That is, for almost all brands in the BrandZ database the vast majority of their customers do not see them as different.\n\nThis is a perfect replication of our findings, by an independent group of researchers – very independent given their a strong record of promoting the gospel of differentiation.\n\n*The empirical data is clear, most of the successful brands in the world have very low perceived differentiation, yet they have loyal customers, they earn profits, and many of them have done so for many decades. And will continue to do so, and with low perceived differentiation.* Recently, it has been suggested that awareness and salience play a greater role in buyer behaviour and how brands compete than current differentiation theory would suggest (Ehrenberg, Barnard & Scriven 1997; Romaniuk & Sharp 2004a&b).\n\nThe data from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, Young & Rubicam, and Millward Brown on perceived differentiation all support this. All brands are ‘differentiated’ (they do not compete as perfect substitutes), in the sense that for each buyer there are brands that they know well and other brands they think very little about. For each buyer there are many brands he or she never or seldom considers purchasing. But this is not textbook brand differentiation in the sense of buyers perceiving brands as being meaningfully different from others.\n\n# Distinctiveness: an alternative perspective\n\nParadoxically, the reduced emphasis on meaningful differentiation makes branding even more important. Loyalty is largely underpinned by mental and physical availability not love/hate. To encourage brand loyalty a brand must stand out so that buyers can easily, and without confusion, identify it. The focus on meaningful, perceived differentiation in marketing literature has distracted from this traditional aspect of branding practice.",

      "content": "The fundamental purpose of branding is to identify the source of the product or service. This is the reason that branding was first developed. Branding must have qualities that distinguish the brand from other competitors. One obvious characteristic is the brand name itself, which is, by law, unique. There are also other distinctive elements that, as part of a brand’s identity, can supplement or substitute for the brand name. These qualities help the consumer to notice, recognise and recall the brand – when the brand is advertising and in buying situations. These elements can include:\n\n* colours – such as the Garnier green and the TNT orange  \n* logos – such as McDonald’s golden arches  \n* taglines – such as Nike’s ‘Just do it’  \n* symbols/characters – such as Mickey Mouse’s ears * celebrities – such as Tiger Woods for Nike\n\n* advertising styles – such as MasterCard’s ‘priceless’ campaign.\n\nA distinctive asset is anything that shows people what brand is being offered for sale. These can be used on packaging and in advertising, in-store displays and sponsorships – they can be used in any marketing activity where the marketer wants the consumer to be able to identify the brand. This might be to build, refresh or reinforce consumer memory structures or to facilitate purchasing by making the brand easier to locate. The stronger and fresher the links between these distinctive elements and the brand name, the easier it is for the consumer to identify the brand. While for packaged goods bought off retail supermarket, pharmacy or hardware shelves this link to the brand name isn’t even necessary. The distinctive asset alone can brand the product.\n\n# Benefits of a distinctive brand\n\nDistinctive brand assets benefit both the marketer and the consumer. A brand loses custom if its potential customers can’t find it. Also, communications are more effective if correctly branded. Much has been written about the cluttered environment, the overload of information due to the greater number of choices available. Distinctiveness reduces the need to think, scour and search – thus making life easier for consumers, without them even realising it. This is a very different consumer benefit from that offered by differentiation, and it has an intrinsic value to the consumer. For example, I value service; therefore I seek a brand that will give fabulous service.",

      "content": "Consumers do not use American Express because they value the colour blue; but seeing the distinctive blue allows people to easily identify that this ad, piece of direct mail, sponsorship is by AmEx (Gaillard, Romaniuk & Sharp 2005).\n\nUnlike ‘meaningful’ differentiation, these qualities can be trade-marked and legally protected (Johnson 1997). It also becomes foolish for a competitor to use the same elements in their advertising, as the advertising is then misattributed to the original brand.\n\nThe difference between differentiation and distinctiveness is not just semantics; it is a very real difference that is respected in law.\n\n# What makes a distinctive asset more valuable?\n\nThere are two criteria that make some branding assets worth more than others. These two criteria are:  \n* fame - how many people associate the brand with that asset  \n* uniqueness - of those people how many only associate that brand with the asset\n\nThis assessment must come from consumer research<sup>67</sup>. Marketers and agencies tend not to research and, therefore, they massively over-estimate the strength of their distinctive assets. In turn, this leads to both overestimating the degree of branding that really exists in advertising copy and overestimating how easy a brand is to notice on shelf. We can’t stress enough how important these errors are. It is a very fundamental failure for a marketer not to have carefully market researched their brands’ distinctive assets.\n\nThe purpose of building strong, distinctive assets is to increase the number of stimuli that can act as identification triggers for a brand. Distinctive assets improve advertising effectiveness by making it more likely that viewers will correctly identify which brand the advertising belongs to. In a shopping environment, distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice and purchase a brand.",

      "content": "It is important that each distinctive element is uniquely linked to its brand. If consumers also think of competitors when prompted with that element, then the element fails to act as a brand name substitute. If a shared, distinctive element is substituted for the brand name, the risk is that consumers will think of a competitor rather than the target brand. The second criterion for considering an element to be a distinctive asset is that it is prevalent. This means that the majority of consumers link the brand to the element. A distinctive element that is unique, but unknown, cannot act as a substitute for the brand name because most people who encounter it will not think of the brand name.\n\nThe purpose of building strong, distinctive assets is to increase the number of stimuli that can act as identification triggers for a brand. Distinctive assets improve advertising effectiveness by making it easier for viewers to identify which brand the advertising belongs to. In a shopping environment, distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice, recognise and therefore purchase a brand.\n\n# Building distinctive assets Distinctive assets need to be learned by consumers.\n\nUntil the links between distinctive elements and the brand are learned they cannot function as a substitute for the brand. To successfully teach the link requires a commitment over many years, even decades. For example, the Nike ‘swoosh’ was first introduced in the 1970s; for a long while it was shown alongside the brand name, prior to being used as a solo brand identifier. The strong recognition that the Nike swoosh has today is because of the consistent investment over many decades. A brand can’t be distinctive unless it is consistent.",

      "content": "To build strong, distinctive elements the brand must be consistently communicated to consumers across all media and over time. The importance of consistency has been emphasised by many branding commentators, and particularly by the proponents of integrated marketing communications. They have advocated consistency across campaign elements and media, rather than over time. It’s something of a mystery why some marketers embrace the idea of consistency across media but not consistency across campaigns. And the consistency emphasis has been too much on the brand’s message and positioning, rather than to the visual, verbal or style of branding elements. Consistency in brand identity is something that many brand strategies lack, particularly across campaigns. For example, when a new campaign is created, most of the attention is placed on what is new and fresh. More attention should be placed on making sure the branding elements are similar and consistent; someone who saw the last marketing campaign should understand that the new campaign comes from the same brand. It is only when there is discipline in this consistency that distinctive brand assets build.\n\nIn Chapter 4 we saw how all brands have a ‘long tail’ of very occasional buyers; because most of a brand’s buyers rarely buy and rarely think of it, they are easily confused by inconsistent communication and packaging changes.\n\n# A new research focus\n\nWhile there has been considerable literature on the different elements that could represent distinctive assets, a great deal of this research has been misdirected. It has tried to establish the value of potential distinctive assets to consumers, from a differentiation-style perspective. For example, research into the colours associated with brands often focus on what the colours mean to consumers, or try to identify the best colour for a brand (Bellizzi et al 1983; Grimes & Doole 1998). However, the real value of building strong links to an element such as a particular colour is not that people may like, say blue more than yellow (and so a brand should choose blue over yellow in its packaging, communications, etc).",

      "content": "The value is that if a brand consistently uses blue in its packaging and communications, and it is the only brand that uses blue, consumers should quickly and easily identify that blue represents the brand. This will hopefully mean that colour can replace the brand in some circumstances, or extend the branding quality of any communication beyond simply mentioning or showing the brand name.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nScientific laws, theory and direct empirical evidence challenge the importance placed on meaningful perceived differentiation. Differentiation *does* exist, but the degree of differentiation is weak and varies little between rival brands, and it is far less important than is portrayed. Brands within a category do not vary markedly in their degree of differentiation, perceived or otherwise. While Pizza Hut, McDonald’s and KFC sell different products (pizza, burgers and fried chicken, respectively) the reality is that they compete as fast food brands.\n\nThis finding has resulted in the presentation of an alternative strategic emphasis: marketing should build distinctive qualities that increase the visibility of the brand in its competitive environment price (i.e. branding matters). Distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice, recognise, recall and (importantly) buy the brand. An emphasis on distinctiveness means less of trying to find unique selling propositions and more trying to find unique identifying characteristics. Distinctive assets are not what motivate consumers to buy brands; it’s how they know where the brand is and what brand they bought. They allow for the development of loyalty.\n\nThe next three chapters present empirical evidence on how marketing interventions, like advertising and price promotions, work. Then we can return to this topic of how brands compete and what marketers must achieve in order to grow market share over the long term.",
