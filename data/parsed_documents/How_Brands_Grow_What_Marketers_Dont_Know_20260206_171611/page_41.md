This means that a brand’s defection rate is essentially a function of its market share, and the category it’s in. This defection level does not vary substantially between competing brands.

How many customers a brand loses in a year depends on how many it has to lose in the first place. Obviously a brand can’t lose a million customers if it doesn’t have a million customers to start with. Larger brands therefore can, and do, lose more customers each year, and they also gain more customers. But as a proportion of their customer base they lose (and gain) less than smaller brands, i.e. their defection percentage is lower.

Imagine a two-brand market. One brand is smaller with 20% market share (a customer base of 200 customers); the other larger brand has 80% market share (a customer base of 800 customers). If the two brands maintain their respective share of customers, then each brand’s defections must equal its acquisitions. Imagine the large brand loses (and gains) 100 customers each year. Then, in this two-brand market, the small brand must also lose and gain 100 customers (see Figure 3.1). The small brand’s defection level is 50% (100 divided by 200) while the larger brand’s defection level is only 12.5% (100 divided by 800).

**Figure 3.1:** The smaller the brand the higher the defection (and acquisition) metric

This data depicts a customer switching dynamic between a "Big Brand" and a "Small Brand." The core relationship is a bidirectional customer flow, with "100 customers switch each way" indicating an equal number of customers moving from the Big Brand to the Small Brand and vice-versa. The structure highlights a comparative aspect, contrasting the customer base turnover rates. Specifically, the Small Brand experiences a higher proportion of its customer base switching away, implying a greater churn rate for the smaller entity compared to the larger one. This suggests a competitive landscape where the Small Brand, despite receiving customers from the Big Brand, struggles with customer retention.

In real markets there are more than two brands so things are more complicated. But the fundamental pattern, the double jeopardy law, still holds with brands with a larger market share having slightly lower defection levels (i.e. higher loyalty).

The empirical reality of the double jeopardy law is a fatal blow to Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) idea of easily and cheaply halving customer defection.
