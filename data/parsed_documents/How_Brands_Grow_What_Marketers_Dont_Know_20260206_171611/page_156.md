Larger price elasticities for price increases are consistent with a well-known finding in consumer psychology called ‘loss aversion’. Experimental studies show support for loss aversion; for example, many consumers are reluctant to accept fair bets because the potential loss, of say $20, outweighs the attractiveness of possibly winning $20 (Kahneman & Tversky 1979). If consumers have an approximate reference price for a brand, an increase above that reference level is perceived as a ‘loss’ with a corresponding drop in the likelihood of purchase.

This differential effect of price increases appears to be even more marked for private label brands: their downward price elasticity tends to be quite low (because they are already often cheaper), but if their price is put up, their sales loss is quite pronounced.

### 5) If the brand’s normal price is close to the average of the other brands

If the price of a brand is close to the average prices of competitors, its elasticity will be greater. There are two reasons for this. First, if prices for all the brands are very dispersed, then a price change by one brand bridges the price gap between it and competitors by a smaller amount.

Second, if the brand’s price is close to the average of competitors, a price change – either upward or downward – will take the brand past the price of one or more of those competitors (i.e. go from cheaper to dearer, or vice versa). Pricing experiments showed average price elasticities in double figures when all the brands start at the same price – because a change results in setting one brand’s price below all the others, resulting in a huge swing in consumer choice. A good example of this phenomenon is petrol in urban locations where it is easy to switch from one station to another.

By contrast, elasticities are smaller when a brand’s price is further away from the centre or average of the prices in its category. This dampening effect on price elasticity is especially marked if most of the other competitor brands’ prices are close together.

There are three other category characteristics that lead to larger price elasticities. These are  
(1) categories with fewer brands,  
(2) goods that consumers buy very regularly and  
(3) categories that can be stockpiled (Narasimhan, Neslin & Sen 1996).
