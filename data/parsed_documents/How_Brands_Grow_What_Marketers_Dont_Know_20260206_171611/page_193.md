This table outlines a framework for understanding brand perception, differentiating between high and low levels of "L<sub>A</sub>" (likely a measure of brand familiarity or engagement).  At the "High L<sub>A</sub>" end, positive brand associations are fostered through "Brand Reinforcing" activities, leading to "Familiarity." Conversely, "Low L<sub>A</sub>" is associated with negative outcomes such as "Confusion" and "Alienation." The table also indicates that "Relevant News" and "Empathy" contribute to the positive side, while "Entertainment" appears to be a neutral or potentially ambiguous factor, not explicitly tied to either high or low L<sub>A</sub> in this representation. The structure suggests a spectrum of brand impact, moving from positive reinforcement and familiarity to negative confusion and alienation based on the level of L<sub>A</sub>.

how often they have seen it advertised or seen it in real life). It seems we have an in-built counting mechanism (see Hasher & Zacks 1984). As humans evolved this mechanism was presumably very useful in helping to distinguish between the familiar and unfamiliar and to detect subtle differences (e.g. not as many birds in the forest) that might indicate danger.

All this means that clever, likable creativity is a way to get advertising noticed. But it is only one way. What we see depends on what is already in our heads; therefore, the following rules matter too.

## Rule 4: Refresh and build memory structures

Even if a brand’s advertising is noticed it can’t work unless it refreshes or creates *useful* memory structures for the brand. This requires understanding what consumers already have in their minds and then working with this, not against it. This is the purpose of brand image research, to understand existing memory structures so that communication can be crafted to reflect them.

It’s a shame when high-quality, creative advertising fails to do anything for the brand; and yet this happens regularly because the advertising didn’t reinforce or build appropriate memory structures. For example, Miller Lite ran a creative series of ‘man law’ television commercials. These commercials featured an interesting collection of minor celebrities (like Burt Reynolds) who would debate an issue and make a ruling (a ‘man law’). These celebrities ruled on issues like, ‘Is the high five overused?’, ‘If a girl breaks up with your best friend how long do you have to wait before you can ask her out on a date?’ and ‘Are wireless headsets useful or a technology gone bad?’ The advertising campaign attracted much attention: there were web site discussions about man laws, the commercials were posted to YouTube by fans and radio stations mimicked the campaign and held talk-back discussions on their own man laws.
