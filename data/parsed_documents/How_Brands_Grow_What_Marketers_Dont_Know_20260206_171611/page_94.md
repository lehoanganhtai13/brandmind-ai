This data presents a comparative analysis of the number of different brands bought against the number of category purchases. The structure appears to be a distribution or frequency count, where specific ranges of category purchases correspond to a percentage of different brands bought. Specifically, approximately 40% of category purchases involve buying only 1 brand, while the percentage decreases as the number of different brands bought increases. A significant portion, around 32.2%, of category purchases involve buying 6-9 different brands, and 24.4% involve 15-17 different brands. The data further indicates that 16.6% of category purchases involve 22-25 different brands, and 8.8% involve 29-31 different brands. A very small percentage, 1.0%, is associated with the highest number of brands bought, though the exact upper limit for this category is not explicitly defined beyond the 29-31 range.

# Divided loyalty

Loyalty is everywhere but it’s seldom exclusive – buyers purchase more than one brand, and the more purchases an individual makes the more brands he or she buys. Polygamous or divided loyalty is quite the norm. So no brand should expect its buyers to be 100% loyal.

Table 7.1 lists the proportion of a brand’s buyers who were exclusively loyal to that brand (in a 12 month period). The average for this selection of brands is 13% of their buyer base. The double jeopardy law holds again for this loyalty metric: smaller brands have a smaller proportion of their customer base who are 100% loyal. All these brands are among the major brands in their respective categories – the metric is even lower for very small brands.

Notice that categories that are purchased less frequently have higher levels of 100% loyalty. Analgesics are bought only five times a year on average, and because this is a skewed average (see Chapter 4), more than half of all households bought from the category only once. These once-only buyers, by definition, have to appear among the 100% loyal buyers – if you only buy once then you can buy only one brand. As time goes by these buyers make more purchases and the proportion that are 100% loyal drops dramatically. This can be seen in categories like breakfast cereals and yoghurts, which are bought more frequently and so show much lower levels of 100% brand loyalty.

**Table 7.1:** 100% loyal buyers are the minority

This data presents a comparative analysis of different product categories, detailing brand performance within each. For Analgesics, Tesco leads with a 22% purchase rate and 37% loyal buyers, followed by Nurofen, Boots, and Panadol. In Deodorants, Lynx has the highest purchase rate at 17% and 21% loyalty, with Dove, Tesco, and Nivea trailing. Crisps (potato chips) are dominated by Walkers, holding a 68% purchase rate and 37% loyalty, significantly ahead of KP and Kettle Foods. Breakfast cereals show Kelloggs as the market leader with 29% purchase rate and 7% loyalty, followed by Cereal Partners and Weet-Bix. Yoghurts are led by Muller at 24% purchase rate and 7% loyalty, with Muller Light, Ski, and Danone also listed. An overall average across all categories indicates a 13% market share and 13% buyer loyalty. **Source: Kantar Worldpanel, UK, 2005.**
