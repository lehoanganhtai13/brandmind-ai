However, the commercials didn’t look like Miller Lite advertising (the humour was more typical of rival brand, Bud), they seldom mentioned beer and nothing about Miller. So what memory structures did they refresh or build? They built the concept of ‘man laws’ and tellingly, nearly every YouTube post described the commercials as the ‘man law’ commercials not the ‘Miller Lite’ commercials. After months of continued decline in sales, Miller dropped the campaign; as Advertising Age wittily stated, Miller decided that market share losses violated man law (Mullman 2007).

For new brands, the emphasis must be on building the memories that consumers use to buy the brand; for example, what the brand actually does, what it looks like, what the brand name is, where it is sold and where and when it is consumed. These are simple, but essential. Forgetting to tell consumers these things is a marketing sin, as is underestimating how difficult this task will be and how long it may take. With this in mind, simplicity is a virtue. Apple’s iPod is a wonderful example. This MP3 player launched into an existing market where there was already considerable choice in technological product features. Digital compressed music was new, slightly complicated technology. Apple launched a single model, with a distinctive, attractive design and characteristic white headphones. The headphones and the play button were prominent, taping into existing memory structures and explaining what the product did. The brand name, iPod, was simple and distinctive; it communicated ‘new technology’ in a friendly, non-technical manner. And everything was reinforced with the verbal explanation “A thousand songs in your pocket”. Notice that Apple did not mention the term ‘MP3 player’ – their advertising didn’t talk about this new technology at all. The iPod advertising was also extremely consistent, over time and across media. It always employed the same silhouette figures against colourful backgrounds and these figures were always joyfully dancing (while listening to their iPods) and the white headphones were always obvious. Technical details were left to sales people and web sites to explain, where necessary.[^98]

For established brands (i.e. for most advertising) the need to refresh is paramount. Even Coca-Cola’s marketers have to remind people (not explain) that it’s a refreshing drink especially when you are hot. Building a new memory structure for an existing brand is a long-term project.
