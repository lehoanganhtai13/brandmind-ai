advertising to reach the target market efficiently. Instead of  
scattering their marketing efforts (the ‘shotgun’ approach),  
they can focus on the buyers who have greater purchase  
interest (the ‘rifle’ approach).  

According to Kotler and colleagues (1998), brands are supposed to target  
segments of the market, which would severely limit the number of other  
brands they compete with.  

While this may sound logical and straightforward, there are a number of  
problems with this theory. It’s difficult to think of a real-world example of  
mass marketing that fits the extreme definition: few, if any, firms have only  
one product, with one price. It is also unclear how the examples of target  
marketing differ from the less sophisticated ‘product-variety marketing’. Yes,  
Coca-Cola now markets many brands of soft drink, but is this to satisfy the  
distinct needs of particular groups of buyers, or to satisfy individual demand  
for variety, or a bit of both? Oddly, according to Kotler, offering containers of  
different sizes caters for variety seeking, but different flavours cater for  
different people!  

Simply naming a segment does not make it exist. We could similarly create  
‘segment’ names to match Kotler’s product-variety strategy (e.g. the high  
quality seeking segment, the large pack economy oriented segment, and so  
on). However, for this to have any meaning there would need to be empirical  
evidence that each of Coca-Cola’s brands really does sell to different people.  
Kotler presents no data to substantiate his claims.  

Table 6.1 shows that various soft drink brands share their customer base with  
Coca-Cola; that is, the table shows what proportion of each soft drink brand’s  
customers also bought Coca-Cola during the analysis period. The data is from  
the Kantar Impulse Panel, which I have specifically chosen because it covers  
individual consumers buying for their personal use. Therefore, the repertoire  
of brand buying shown in the table is not due to different brands being bought  
by different people in the same household.  

**Table 6.1:** Sharing of customers  

This data presents a comparative analysis of buyers of product X, detailing the percentage of these buyers who also purchased (regular) Coca-Cola during the same period. The structure highlights the overlap in purchasing behavior across different consumer segments for product X. Specifically, it shows that buyers of Diet Coke had a 65% overlap with regular Coca-Cola purchasers, while Fanta buyers showed a 70% overlap. Lift buyers exhibited a 67% overlap, and Pepsi buyers demonstrated the highest overlap at 72%. The average overlap across all analyzed buyer groups for product X and regular Coca-Cola was 69%, indicating a significant cross-purchasing trend.

*Source: Kantar Impulse Worldpanel.* As you can see, a high proportion of each brand’s buyers also bought Coca-Cola, and this proportion varies little between the different brands – it’s always about two-thirds of their customer base<sup>34</sup>.
