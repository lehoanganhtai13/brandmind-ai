social media campaigns based on ‘earned media’ that only reach heavy buyers). Resist customising your advertising unless you can see clear return for low cost – for example, global brands usually translate their ads into different languages.

# Isn’t it expensive to try to reach light buyers?

This is a myth that holds marketers back.

Reaching millions of light buyers was the same challenge that faced marketers in the 20th Century and thanks to the emergence of mass media and national retail chains they were able to build brands, even global brands. Mass media and retail chains still exist, and are becoming increasingly global. They offer marketers great efficiency. In developed countries it still costs only around 2 cents to reach a person with a 30 second video using TV, in many countries it is far cheaper than this even. Today in the 21st Century we are in the golden age of mass media and mass distribution, and marketer who realise and exploit this will do very well.

# Our commercials always features women, but we know that men make up a large chunk of our buyer base - should we change our advertising?

It’s important to distinguish between your targeting (you certainly have to reach and appeal to men) and your distinctive brand image – which may depend on using women in your advertising. But don’t assume, research your distinctive assets, check if the women in your advertising are an important part of your branding or not, and check if you are reaching and resonating with men or not.

# Market partitions are just another name for segments aren’t they?

No, partitions are groups of brands that compete more directly with each other, and less directly with other brands in the category. Partitions may relate to different types of people (segments), for example sweeter breakfast cereals sell more to households with children, but such links may not always be obvious or of any practical consequence.

It’s important to remember that partitioning, while common, is usually slight. That’s why we call them partitions, not separate markets. They often require no marketing reaction, for example just because there is a partition does not mean you need to have a separate SKU or brand to service it, your existing brand may already compete very well in that partition as well as the rest of the market.
