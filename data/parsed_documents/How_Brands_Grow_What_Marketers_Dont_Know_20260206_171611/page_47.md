Smart marketers know they need to reach all buyers (i.e. buyers of the category, and everyone from light to heavy buyers of a brand) in order to reinforce buying propensities, and to win new sales.

## The death of mass marketing?

This table outlines two distinct marketing strategies: Mass Marketing and Target Marketing. Mass Marketing adopts a broad approach, aiming to sell to all buyers within a product category, characterized by a large number of occasional purchasers and a tolerance for weak customer loyalty and relationships. In contrast, Target Marketing employs a more focused approach, deliberately excluding some category buyers to concentrate efforts on specific groups. These targeted groups can be either those who purchase the brand more frequently (heavier buyers) or a clearly defined segment of individuals with shared characteristics. The core difference lies in the scope of the customer base and the emphasis placed on building relationships versus maximizing reach.

Professor Phil Kotler and colleagues (1998), amongst others, have declared mass marketing to be old fashioned. ‘Modern’ marketing is said to be about positioning; targeting segments; focusing on loyal, heavier buyers; focusing on retention (not acquisition) and return on investment (ROI). Oddly, textbooks have been preaching this ‘new’ message for decades. Today’s fashionable media strategy uses new, diverse, low-reach media to deliver new ‘consumer engagement’ (see Nelson-Field et al 2012). Broad-reaching television channels and newspapers – while still very much used by marketers (to great effect) – are no longer de rigueur. Today the fashion is for loyalty programs, websites for loyalists (e.g. Budweiser’s (ill-fated) ‘Bud.tv’), targeting ‘influencers’, customer relationship management (CRM) and ‘new media’.
