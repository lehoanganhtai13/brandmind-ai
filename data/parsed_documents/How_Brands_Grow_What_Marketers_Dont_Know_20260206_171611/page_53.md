For example, the 4% or so of Coca-Cola’s buyers who purchased Coke once a week or more (52+ times that year) delivered a bit more than 20% of its sales volume that year.

Fortunately, these ultra-heavy buyers are comparatively easy to market to, because the category and the brand are, comparatively speaking, much more important to them than to the typical buyer. These heavy buyers get many opportunities to see point-of-sale material and packaging changes (and they are presumably very good at learning about regular promotions). These buyers are also far more receptive to the brand’s advertising: they notice it more and they find it easier to process and remember.

At the very extreme, the buyer who drinks Coca-Cola morning, noon, and night has a very well ingrained habit. They are locked in their ways and may even be a little bit addicted to the product category[^22]. One could argue there is little need to market to these buyers at all, especially considering that they are comparatively non-responsive to advertising (i.e. their behaviour tends not to change in response to advertising; their buying neither increases nor decreases). They will keep buying in large volumes until one day something momentous happens and they downgrade, or drop the brand, or quit the category (or die), all of which is usually out of your control.

At the other end of the buying spectrum are the typical, very infrequent buyers. These people – who are most of your consumers – are a marketing challenge because it is hard to justify spending money on them individually (direct mail is usually out of the question). And yet collectively they are important for sales volume and offer great potential for growth. An implication of the skewed distribution of buying rates is that to maintain sales a brand needs to reach out to these masses of buyers. For two reasons:

1. there are so many of them  
2. they buy so infrequently and could easily forget about you.

# Pareto’s law (but not as you know it)

You may be wondering if this distribution of buying frequencies has something to do with marketing’s best-known law: 80% of sales come from the heaviest 20% of brand buyers. Yes it does, it underpins Pareto’s ‘80/20’ law. However, it is important to know that the ‘80/20 law’ is a misleading simplification. The ratio is rarely as extreme as 80/20.

The share of purchases undertaken by the heaviest 20% of a brand’s buyers (the ‘Pareto share’) reflects the polarisation in buying rates between the heaviest and lightest buyers.
