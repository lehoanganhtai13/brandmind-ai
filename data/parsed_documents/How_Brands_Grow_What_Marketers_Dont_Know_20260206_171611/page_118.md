Brands that are very differentiated from one another should share very few customers; brands that are positioned in a similar manner should share many customers. Yet the widespread fit of the duplication of purchase law, which states brands share customers with other brands in line with their relative shares, shows that partitioning is generally slight (see Chapter 6).

If brands vary in their degree of differentiation, we might expect to see them exhibit different price elasticity, as customers of more differentiated brands would be less sensitive to price. However, price elasticity seems to vary more with the context of the price change (see Chapter 10). This again suggests that brands within a category have similar levels of differentiation.

Finally, we must consider the highly successful, empirically grounded mathematical model, the NBD-Dirichlet (Goodhardt, Ehrenberg & Chatfield 1984). This model effectively assumes that brands compete as undifferentiated choice options of varying popularity. The real world conforms to this model, with the NBD-Dirichlet successfully predicting a wide variety of brand performance metrics in dozens of product categories, different countries and across time (Ehrenberg, Uncles & Goodhardt 2004).[^61]

Every category has brands that differ in price and quality (referred to as ‘vertical differentiation’ by economists). Sometimes a category contains brands that are vastly more expensive than the other brands in the category. This price difference shows up in the dissimilarity of the different (i.e. cheaper and more expensive) brand’s user bases. The price difference is also exhibited in the more expensive brand’s departure from the duplication of purchase law and NBD-Dirichlet benchmarks. The fact that this evidence is not often seen for other brands suggests weak levels of differentiation at best.[^62]

This body of theory and empirical evidence does not support the traditional role of differentiation presented in much marketing literature, nor does it support a ‘perfect competition’ (commodity) model. Differentiation undoubtedly exists, but empirically grounded theory suggests differentiation is best thought of as a category level (rather than brand level) phenomenon. In summary, differentiation theory is like the neo-classical, economic, perfect competition model, in that it describes an abstract ideal world and not the one that real brands compete within.
