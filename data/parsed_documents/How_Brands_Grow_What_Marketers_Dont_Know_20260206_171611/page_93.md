Figure 7.1 was compiled by Ehrenberg-Bass Institute researcher Dr Virginia Beal; it is based on Nielsen data on US households. The figure shows the number of television channels each household has access to in their subscription and how many they actually watch. The key point is how quickly the line flattens; when a household has access to 40 channels they watch about a dozen or so each week, households with access to 80 channels watch a few more than a dozen each week, and households with access to 200 channels still only watch a few more than a dozen each week.

This data illustrates a relationship between the number of channels a household has access to and the number of channels they actually view. Initially, as the number of accessible channels increases from 0 to approximately 70, the number of viewed channels also shows a corresponding increase, rising from 0 to 16. However, beyond roughly 70 accessible channels, the number of viewed channels plateaus and remains constant at 16, even as the number of accessible channels continues to rise significantly, up to 200. This suggests a saturation point where additional channel availability does not lead to increased viewing.

*Nielsen, 2002*

In 2014 Nielsen released data showing how this pattern and the average number of channels viewed has held steady in spite of households gaining access to more channels. What this shows is that viewers (sensibly) keep returning to their favourite channels. There is obvious loyalty. Most viewers watch enough television to watch many more channels than they do, but they prefer to restrict their personal repertoire. They learn the channel numbers of their favourites and go there first. The chart looks almost identical if we examine brand buying in any category, for example, if it instead showed the number of purchases made by an individual and how many different brands they had bought (see Figure 7.2). Loyalty is everywhere, from soap to soap operas.
