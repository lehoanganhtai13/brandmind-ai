# Chapter 5: Our Buyers Are Different

Byron Sharp

----

The good news is that your customers are just like your competitors’ customers, and their customers are like yours. This means their buyers are up for grabs. So, target the whole market – all sorts of different people.

## Who are our buyers? Who are our potential customers?

Common marketing ideology states that differentiated brands should sell to different groups of people, or should sell for different occasions or uses. In which case, an important question for brand managers is, “What sort of people buy my brand?” The answer to this question provides insight into how to market a brand. It also allows for a brand’s current sales potential to be estimated: if a brand sells to a unique customer base it can’t sell to everyone and its growth potential has clear boundaries.

In 1959 a business school professor at the University of Hawaii gave personality tests to people who owned Ford and Chevrolet cars (see Evans 1959). This sounds like an odd thing to do, but the theory was that Americans in the 1950s took their cars very seriously, cars were deeply symbolic purchases, and marketers had invested in building distinctive brand images. It was expected this would show up in interesting ways in the personality profiles of the respective customer bases. Executives from car companies and academics had expressed this belief.

The results were indeed interesting. The personality and demographic profiles of Ford and Chevrolet owners were essentially identical. The lack of difference shocked the marketing world. At first people argued about the results. Then the finding was repeatedly confirmed with different samples, techniques and product categories. After that everyone decided to ignore the discovery. As Winston Churchill said, “Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, but usually manages to pick himself up, walk over or around it, and carry on.” (Klotz 1996).
