There is plenty to debate about whether an obsession with sales growth is good for profits in the long run, but let’s accept the idea that it would be good to know more about how to deliver market share growth and prevent decline.

# The difference between large and small brands

A sensible starting point in understanding growth is to compare competing brands that have different market shares. A million brands have attempted to grow – some have been successful and some not. Can we use these trillions of dollars worth of natural experiments to discover something universal about the differences between large and small brands? Yes; the difference between large and small brands, and growing and declining brands, is very revealing.

Again and again it appears in numerous product categories, markets and countries that there is a fundamental law of brand size:¹¹ big brands have markedly larger customer bases.  
This seems obvious – more sales equals more customers – yet it need not be this way. A brand’s sales volume depends on two things:  
* how many buyers it has  
* how often they buy the brand.

One multiplied by the other equals sales. So a brand could be large because it is bought very often by its buyers, without having many buyers. Theoretically there could be two brands of equal size, one with many buyers who buy the brand occasionally, while the other brand has half the number of buyers but they buy it twice as often.¹² See Table 2.1 for an illustration of this point.

**Table 2.1:** Different metrics that can result in equal sales volumes and shares

This data illustrates a comparative analysis of two hypothetical brands, Dell-icious and AppleCore, both of equal size, to determine their resulting market share. The comparison focuses on two key metrics: annual market penetration, representing the percentage of the market that purchases from the brand annually, and the number of purchases made per buyer per annum. Dell-icious exhibits a higher annual market penetration at 32% but a lower number of purchases per buyer per annum (3), leading to a market share of 14%. Conversely, AppleCore has a lower annual market penetration of 16% but a higher number of purchases per buyer per annum (6), also resulting in a market share of 14%. This demonstrates that different combinations of market penetration and purchase frequency can yield identical market shares.

But this happens only in theory, never in practice. In the real world, two brands of about equal market share have around equal market penetration, and so they must also get bought by their buyers at a similar average rate.

There is another related discovery: when you look at brands of markedly different sizes you typically see that their penetration metrics differ a lot,¹³ while their average purchase rate varies little. Put another way: *loyalty doesn’t vary much.* This is not what traditional (or fashionable) marketing literature implies.
