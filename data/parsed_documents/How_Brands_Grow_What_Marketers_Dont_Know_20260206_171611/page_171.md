To understand the new theory of branded competition for sales we need to consider the hectic complicated world of real consumers.

# Busy buyers

As discussed in Chapter 4, most customers are very light, occasional buyers of a brand. A brand is a very small part of its customers’ lives; people don’t think much about brands, even the ones they buy – after all there are so many brands. This is largely why brands advertise, to ensure that customers don’t forget to buy them.

Yet it is difficult to talk to buyers because they are so busy with their lives. Machines used to be referred to as ‘labour-saving devices’ because it was thought that they would lead to more leisure time. Instead, new technology has squeezed even more into our already busy lives. For example, the global impact of the mobile phone has been dramatic. We used to spend a lot of time waiting for other people. Now, meetings can be replaced with an immediate phone call; waiting for others to arrive is replaced by a call or text message to see where they are; agendas and locations can be changed in minutes. Time is precious, we all only have one life, and it is a human trait to try to do more with the time we have.

For marketers, this makes the task of getting attention very difficult. On top of this, when people aren’t working they have many more interesting things to think about than brands! I’m not just referring to the really important things in life like family, friends, politics, hobbies, sport and saving the planet. Yahoo US reported that the top search terms for 2008 were:

This data presents a ranked list of the top 10 most searched terms, indicating their relative popularity. The structure is a simple, linear ranking from 1 to 10. The terms themselves span diverse categories, including celebrities (Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, Angelina Jolie, Barack Obama), entertainment franchises (WWE, Naruto, American Idol), and a video game (RuneScape). This comparative ranking highlights which topics garnered the most online search interest within the observed period, with entertainment figures and events dominating the top positions.

This is what people really think about! Also, six out of the top ten were the same as the previous year. Over much of the past ten years, Britney Spears has been an incredibly popular search term; she has been the most popular for seven out of eight years last decade (part of Google’s genius was the early work they did to identify all the potential misspellings of search terms like “Britney Spears” so that Google users found what they were looking for<sup>83</sup>).
