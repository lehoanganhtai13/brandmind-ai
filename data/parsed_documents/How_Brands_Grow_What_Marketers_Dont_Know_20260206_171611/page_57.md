In fact, few of these buyers are actually changing, which can seem rather mysterious, and is widely misunderstood. Most people don’t know about the law of buyer moderation. This law undermines marketers’ strategies to target heavy buyers of a brand and ignore light buyers (and the great deal of sales potential that they offer).

The law of buyer moderation occurs because of variation in the timing of individuals’ purchasing. Some years buyers purchase the brand once, other years they buy it twice as much – this isn’t real change; there is simply a (predictable) degree of wobble even around a stable ongoing buying rate. This wobble means that some of the households that were called ‘non-buyers of the brand’ weren’t really – they just hadn’t bought in the particular base year and so were misclassified as non-buyers. Just as some buyers were misclassified as light buyers when they really were heavier. Other customers were misclassified as heavy buyers because they bought the brand a bit more often than usual in the year the analyst chose to classify them (perhaps relatives came to visit so one year they had to buy extra). This phenomenon is much worse over short periods (a month or a quarter) than over a year, though it still occurs in annual data, and even for a big brand, as Table 4.4 above shows.

Remember people wobble/vary in both the amount they buy from the category and how they distribute their buying within their repertoire – due to thousands of things like the weather, getting caught in traffic, having a party to go to, having someone to stay, taking a different path through the supermarket and so on. It’s easy for a person to go from buying a brand twice in one year to four times in the next, and the other way round, *without any change in that person’s loyalties* (see Sharp et al 2012). For many brands random wobble like this can move a consumer from being a light buyer (bottom 80%) to being a heavy buyer (top 20%) because most buyers buy less than twice a year – see Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3.

So we have three key facts about marketing’s Pareto law:

1. It is law-like and applies across brands and categories.  
2. It’s not as severe as 80/20.  
3. The analytical time period affects Pareto metrics and messes up attempts to target based on customer value. Put simply, next period your heaviest 20% of customers won’t be so heavy, the light buyers will be heavier, and some of the non-buyers will buy.
