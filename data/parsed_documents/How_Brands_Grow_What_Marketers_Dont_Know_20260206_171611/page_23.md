* over-investing in already highly loyal consumers, while neglecting to reach new buyers  
* pricing too high then trying to compensate with very regular price discounts  
* teaching consumers to buy when the brand is discounted  
* burning media dollars in advertising bursts then going silent for long periods (when consumers are still buying)  
* paying premiums for low-reach ‘niche’ media.  

It’s not that there is anything wrong with the intelligence of marketers, but like all professionals they need some empirically grounded guidance.

# Law-like reoccurring patterns

The research that underpins this book is different from commercial market research because it focuses on finding fundamental patterns, not one-off events. These are findings that have a long use-by date because they have been found to hold for long periods of time, across all sorts of conditions (including across product and service categories, and countries). This research is also very different from most academic research, where each study is typically based on one single set of data, collected in one particular set of conditions, and so tells us almost nothing about the generalisability of the finding (where it holds and where it does not). 9

Uncovering patterns that generalise is the fundamental work of science. It is only because we know that these scientific laws hold across a wide range of conditions that they can be used for prediction. And by knowing the many factors that do not affect the laws, and maybe the few that do, we gain deep explanatory insight into why things are the way they are, and how things work.  
This is how science works.

# Where do these discoveries come from?

This book draws largely from the work of researchers at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science. The early discoveries come from work started by Professor Andrew Ehrenberg and Professor Gerald Goodhardt five decades ago.
