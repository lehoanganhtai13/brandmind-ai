So it is quite misplaced to conclude that advertising that affects intentions or attitudes works better. This fact undermines much academic research into advertising that has derived rules about effectiveness by examining the effect of advertising exposure on stated intentions (often in artificial laboratory settings with unrealistic lags and heightened attention). Similarly, advertising pre-tests (copy tests) that use intentions or intention shift are biased towards particular types of advertising content, and very often reach incorrect conclusions about the sales effectiveness of particular commercials.

Many companies are trapped in the intentions/preference paradigm. They brief their agencies and evaluate their advertising in line with this model (sometimes without even realising it). Consequently, they produce advertising containing persuasive arguments (often about trivial benefits) that are rejected, misunderstood or ignored by viewers. They also produce advertising that fails to refresh or build appropriate mental structures because management’s attention is on the ad’s selling message. Such advertising fails to communicate consistently the distinctive aspects of a brand. Consequently, many firms produce campaign after campaign where each looks and feels different – as if each were for a different brand.

Somewhat ironically, companies that use this persuasion model of how advertising works will sometimes produce what they call ‘image advertising’ or ‘awareness advertising’, and they do not expect this to produce sales. Of course it should be expected to generate sales – that’s what advertising is for.

Marketers need to understand the memory structures that have already been built for their brand. They need to use these, and ensure their advertising refreshes these structures. Then they need to research what other memory structures might be useful to the brand (i.e. factors driving purchase in the category) and then work to build these. Over decades, leading brands have done stellar jobs at building relevant memory structures. Coca-Cola is a great example. In the past, Coca-Cola was sold in US ‘drug stores’ and so it was associated with drug store visits in summer by teenagers. Today Coca-Cola is associated with a variety of memories: the beach and Coca-Cola, nightclubs and Coca-Cola, pizza and Coca-Cola, parties and Coca-Cola, cafes and Coca-Cola (‘the original long black’), the Coca-Cola bottle, Coca-Cola red, Coca-Cola swirl and so on. These memories make it more likely that Coca-Cola will come to mind; they make it easier for people to notice Coca-Cola and to process Coca-Cola’s advertising.
