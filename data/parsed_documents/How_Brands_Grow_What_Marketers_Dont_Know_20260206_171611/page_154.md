Therefore, a decision to engage in discounting, or to escalate it, must consider that competitors are likely to respond in kind, which will result in lower profits, or even severe hardship, for all players.

# How much extra volume does a price cut generate?

Price promotions boost sales volume in the short term; but by how much? The term used to discuss this is price ‘elasticity’ – the percentage change in volume from a 1% change in price. For example, if a price is cut by 10% and sales volume increases by 20%, the elasticity is -2 (20/10 = 2, the minus indicates that price and volume move in opposite directions).

Studies have found a reasonable degree of consistency in the average elasticity for temporary promotions. Danaher and Brodie (2000, p. 923) found an average price elasticity of -2.3 across 26 categories, with almost all the price changes examined being for temporary promotions. Scriven and Ehrenberg (2004) found an average elasticity of -2.6 in an exhaustive series of experiments that included both price increases and decreases. Steenkamp and colleagues (2005) examined 442 product categories and reported a mean elasticity of -4.0. Summaries of in-market studies have found an average price elasticity of -2.5 (Bijmolt, van Heerde & Pieters 2005; Tellis 1988).

These results suggest that on average we can expect an increase in sales volume of approximately 25% from a 10% price cut. Most of the authors cited above point out that individual elasticity can vary greatly from 0 to -20 or bigger, although the majority, 70% or so, fall in the range just smaller than -1 to -4. Scriven and Ehrenberg shed light on this variation, showing that elasticity is not a fixed property of a brand, but varies systematically with the context in which a choice decision is made. They found that five factors consistently led to bigger price elasticities, which are now explained.

# Factors leading to bigger price elasticities

### 1) *If the brand’s price moves past a local ‘reference price’*

People are more likely to switch from brand A to brand B when B becomes cheaper than A (where previously, B was more expensive). Changing relative price positions is far more effective than just narrowing the price gap. Similarly, widening a price gap that already exists has less effect than changing relative positions.
