Imagine you are the Insights Director of Colgate Palmolive. Margaret, the Senior Category Manager for toothpaste, is standing at your office door and she is obviously distressed. She is waving a recently received report from your global market research supplier, and this is what it shows:[12]

**Figure 1.1:** Toothpaste brands: US market shares (volume)

This data presents a comparative analysis of the volume percentage occupied by two toothpaste brands, Colgate and Crest. Crest accounts for a significantly larger volume percentage at 37%, while Colgate occupies 19%. The structure is a simple comparison, highlighting the relative market share or presence of these two brands based on volume.

*Data source: Spaeth & Hess 1989.*

The market research shows that Procter & Gamble’s Crest brand of toothpaste has double the market share of Colgate in the US. However, this has long been known and is not the reason why Margaret is upset. It’s the next couple of graphs that have her worried (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3).
