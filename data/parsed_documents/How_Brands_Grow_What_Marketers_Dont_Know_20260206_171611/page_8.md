Brand competition and growth is largely about building two market-based assets: physical availability and mental availability. Brands that are easier to buy – for more people, in more situations – have more market share. Innovation and differentiation (when they work) build market-based assets, which last after competitors copy the innovation.

Therefore, marketers need to improve the branding of their product (i.e. it needs to look like them and only them) and to continuously reach large audiences of light buyers cost effectively. Marketers need to research what their distinctive brand assets are (colours, logos, tone, fonts, etc.); they need to use and protect these. Managers also need to research how buyers buy their brand, when they think of and notice it, and how it fits into their lives (and shopping). Marketers need to manage media and distribution in line with this knowledge.

Advertising works largely by refreshing, and occasionally building, memory structures (and less by convincing rational minds or winning emotional hearts). Marketers need to research these memory structures and ensure that their advertising refreshes these structures by consistently using the brand’s distinctive assets.

In short, there is a great deal to learn, and much to be discovered, about sophisticated mass marketing.

Tables 3, 4 and 5 summarise old and new aspects of marketing.

**Table 3:** Consumer behaviour

This table outlines a shift in consumer behavior, moving from a "Past World View" to a "New World View." In the past, the framework suggested that "Attitude Drives Behavior," leading to distinct consumer types such as "Brand Loyals," "Brand Switchers," and "Deeply Committed Buyers," all characterized by a degree of "Involvement" and a "Rational Involved View" of their choices. The "New World View" inverts this dynamic, proposing that "Behavior Drives Attitude." This new perspective reclassifies consumers into categories like "Loyal Switchers" (appearing under both "Brand Loyals" and "Brand Switchers" from the past), "Uncaring Cognitive Misers" (formerly "Deeply Committed Buyers"), and "Emotional Distracted Viewers" (formerly "Rational Involved Viewers"). This shift is underpinned by the concept of "Heuristics," suggesting a move towards simpler decision-making processes.

**Table 4:** Brand performance

This table outlines a comparative shift in brand performance strategies, moving from a "Past World View" to a "New World View." The core structure is comparative, highlighting contrasting approaches across several key areas. In the past, growth was primarily sought through targeting existing brand loyals, whereas the new approach emphasizes growth through penetration. Metrics were previously obscure and proprietary but are now expected to be predictable and transparent. The effectiveness of price promotions has been re-evaluated; they were once seen as a way to win new customers but are now understood to primarily reach existing loyal customers. Marketing strategies have evolved from target marketing to sophisticated mass marketing. Finally, the concept of differentiation has been refined to distinctiveness, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of how brands stand out in the market.

**Table 5:** Advertising

This table outlines key components of advertising, structured around a "New World" perspective. It highlights the importance of "Positioning" and "Message Comprehension" in crafting effective advertising strategies. Central to this is the identification of "Unique Selling Propositions" which are described as "Relevant." The persuasive aspect of advertising is characterized as "Refreshing," suggesting a need for novelty and impact. Furthermore, advertising serves a "Teaching" function, implying an educational role in informing consumers. Finally, the deployment of advertising is characterized by "Campaign Bursts," indicating a strategic approach to timing and frequency. The overall structure suggests a framework for modern advertising, emphasizing relevance, persuasion, education, and strategic execution. The scientific laws presented in this book apply to many categories:
