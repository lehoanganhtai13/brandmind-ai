It seems incredible that consumers can enter a supermarket and leave with their shopping before closing time. How do they find and select brands? Shoppers do it by adopting a number of useful strategies (e.g. heuristics). A very important strategy is that we ‘satisfice’ rather than optimise.[86] Rather than working hard to find the best product for us, we settle for something that we consider good or satisfactory. Some economists rightly point out that such behaviour is optimal, considering the full cost of gaining the necessary information to make a better buy.[87]

Brand loyalty is a natural behaviour that is based on this satisficing strategy. For many different reasons – many of which could be called ‘habit’ or ‘convenience’ – we buy the same few brands over and over again and simplify buying decisions by only noticing our few regular brands. Often we don’t want to make choices; we are pressed for time, or tired, or really just don’t care. We seldom ever want a large selection from which to choose as it’s too difficult. So we restrict our consideration set down to a few favoured brands. Contrary to some popular books (and TED seminars) we are actually very good at coping with lots of choice, we simply screen most of it out (see Scheibehenne 2010).

Marketing theory pays insufficient attention to this coping behaviour. Instead, theories about buyer behaviour are obsessed with brand evaluation. Obsession is a strong word, and yet it is justified because marketing texts instruct their readers to deliver products and services that fulfil customer needs better than other brands; consultants advise brand managers to make buyers emotionally committed to their brand; and market research (from choice modelling to focus groups) is largely concerned with whether or not customers think a brand’s features are the best.

Yet the most important part of any buyer’s purchasing process (i.e. the part that marketers should be the most interested in) occurs almost entirely without being noticed. This part of the process occurs before buyers consciously evaluate which brand to choose: *buyers, in effect, ‘decide’ not to consider the vast majority of brands on the market*. Instead they notice a few and quite often, only one – this underpins their loyalty.

Most brands are effectively ignored, and sometimes no evaluation between brands takes place; for example, if we want a mortgage, we get one from our bank; if we want legal advice, we ring our lawyer; if we want toothpaste, we look for our preferred brand on the shelf. This lack of evaluation and consideration of alternatives can occur even when a consumer is standing in front of a supermarket shelf that is filled with choices.
