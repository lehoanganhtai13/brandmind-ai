However, advertising a price promotion so widely risks lowering the reference price for the brand to a wider group of people. Therefore, it might be preferable to organise an off-shelf display or retailer advertising without the price cut. Problem is, price-cutting is usually mandatory to obtain an off-shelf display or to feature in the retailer’s advertising.

To summarise, the following observations have been made in this book:  
* Reach is important for brand growth.  
* In-store promotions generally lack reach, but retailer advertising has much broader reach.  
* Price promotions may not be profitable, particularly when the price cut is deep.  
* There is the possibility that reference prices would be eroded, particularly from deep price cuts.  
* However, manufacturers often feel pressurised to participate in price promotions.  

Based on these observations, if a manufacturer had to choose between a promotion that emphasised deep price cuts or a promotion that focused on advertising the brand, the manufacturer should select the latter. This is because the brand would then feature in retailer advertising, which works more like normal advertising and attains reach for the brand. This communication may have to be linked to a reduced price, but the price need not be as low as it would be if the emphasis was all on price and less on communication support.

# Managing Price Promotion Addiction

A price promotion will deliver an increase in sales in most cases. How large this sales increase is and whether the promotion totally decimates all profits depends on factors such as the size of the brand and what its price is relative to the competition before and after the price cut. Current evidence suggests there is no long-term increase in sales as a result of the spike in sales during the price promotion: buyers return to their pre-promotion buying patterns and sales return to pre-promotion levels. This means that a price promotion’s effect on sales and profit can be easily evaluated – the analyst need only consider the sales spike during the promotion period, any possible trough in sales immediately afterward, and likely competitor retaliatory promotions.
