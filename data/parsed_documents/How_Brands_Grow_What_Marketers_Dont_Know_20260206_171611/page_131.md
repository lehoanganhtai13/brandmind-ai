If you accept that Georgiana and June’s story is plausible, then you believe advertising works. This is logical, because billions of dollars are spent on advertising; an amazing 2% of the world’s entire production (GDP) is devoted to advertising. Yet, things are never as clear as they are in Georgiana and June’s world; in the real world, mysteries and contradictions abound. For large brands that have the biggest advertising budgets, sales seldom rise when advertising starts, nor slump when it stops<sup>68</sup>. Also, most buyers say that advertising rarely affects them. Even advertising agencies are extremely reluctant to say that advertising causes sales; they’d much rather talk about engagement, building brand equity, emotional commitment, and added values. In contrast, opponents of advertising say it is a powerful manipulative force. “Advertising troubles both sociologists and financial directors: the former because they think it works, the latter because they think it does not” (Bullmore 1999).

What is going on? Who is right? What evidence is there that advertising drives sales? How does advertising really work? How should marketers use advertising? How should marketers measure advertising’s effects? This chapter answers these questions and presents a model of brand advertising that is consistent with what we know about brand buying behaviour and memory. The shift in thinking is summarised in Table 9.1.

**Table 9.1: Advertising**

This table outlines a shift in advertising strategy, moving from a "Past world view" to a "New world view." The past approach focused on rational or emotional appeals, message comprehension, unique selling propositions, persuasion, teaching, and positioning. In contrast, the new world view emphasizes emotional and rational appeals, prioritizing getting noticed over deep comprehension. It shifts from unique selling propositions to building relevant associations, and from persuasion to refreshing and building memory structures. The focus also moves from teaching to reaching the audience, and from positioning to achieving salience. This represents a transition from a product-centric, information-driven model to a more audience-centric, attention-grabbing, and memory-focused approach.

Neuroscience and psychology have recently advanced our understanding of how memories and brains work. These discoveries have important implications for advertising, because advertising works by creating and refreshing memories. It is now known that much thinking and decision-making is non-conscious and emotional. Yet traditional theories of advertising are based on a dated view that we are usually rational (occasionally emotional) decision-makers, with near perfect memories.
