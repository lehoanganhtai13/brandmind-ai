No sensible marketer would alter their marketing strategy based on this data. Also, around 40% of every brand’s customer base is aged between 35 and 54 years old; this percentage is 47% for Access NatWest – but again, this is a small difference that has no practical significance.

**Table 5.4:** Demographic profiles of credit card brands, UK

This table presents a comparative analysis of credit card ownership demographics, broken down by gender and age groups across various credit card brands. The data is structured to show the percentage distribution of cardholders for each brand, with a specific focus on the male-to-female ratio and the age distribution across ten categories: 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. A consolidated "Average brand" row provides an aggregated view of these demographic percentages. The overall structure is comparative, allowing for direct observation of how different credit card brands align with specific gender and age segments of the consumer base.

These sorts of minor difference – some simply due to random sampling variation – were the norm in all the research studies. This is illustrated in Table 5.5, which shows the average size of the average deviation from the brand norm in more than 40 product/service categories summarised by Dr Rachel Kennedy (see Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000).

**Table 5.5:** Deviation from the brand norm

This data presents a comparative analysis of product categories across three metrics: Demo, Media, and Values, culminating in an Average score. The structure is a simple enumeration of product categories, each assigned numerical values for these metrics. The categories are diverse, ranging from everyday consumables like "Cigarettes" and "Cat food" to services such as "Private health insurance" and "Package holidays," and even durable goods like "Computers" and "Cars." The values assigned appear to represent some form of rating or frequency, with higher numbers indicating a greater presence or significance within each metric. The "Average" column aggregates these scores, providing a consolidated measure for each category. Notably, "Cigarettes" stands out with the highest scores across all metrics and the overall average, while categories like "Airlines," "Camera film," and "Cars" consistently receive lower scores. The table concludes with an overall average across all categories for each metric, serving as a benchmark. **Source: Kennedy & Ehrenberg 2000; Data courtesy of TGI.**
