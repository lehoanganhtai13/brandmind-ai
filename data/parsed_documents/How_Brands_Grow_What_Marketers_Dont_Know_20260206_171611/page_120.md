All the markets we have examined, whether using our own or others’ data, follow a similar pattern: an average of 10% of any brands’ users think their brand is different. It could be that these responses reflect apathy when responding to research questionnaires; however, there are three indicators that this is not the case. 

First, within the markets there were exceptional brands that had obvious functional differences. For example, Aldi supermarkets, which do not stock national brands, scored 67% for “different”; while in the fast food category, sandwich-only brand Subway achieved 50% for “unique” when put in a competitive set with McDonald’s, Domino’s and KFC. So respondents could indicate when something was perceived as differentiated. However, most brands were seldom perceived as such. 

Second, the results show expected differences between markets; for example, soft drinks are more differentiated than water. Spirits and skincare – two categories we deliberately chose because they are considered to be highly image driven and supported by vast amounts of brand advertising expenditure – both showed among the highest levels of perceived differentiation (although still low). 

And, third, other perceptual metrics in the same surveys obtained far higher scores.

To check whether this finding was simply an artefact of the measure, we also tried a forced choice 5-point scale (where 1 is not at all descriptive and 5 is extremely descriptive). The average score was 2.5: few brands scored higher than the neutral midpoint of 3, and none had a mean as high as 4 (a score that would indicate respondents somewhat agreed the brand was different). Therefore, our finding that consumers hardly see their brands as differentiated is consistent across both a pick-any or a rating scale measure.
