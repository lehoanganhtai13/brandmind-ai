Even very senior marketers (and marketing academics) believe many things that are wrong, and there are many important facts that simply aren’t widely known. Many well-paid marketers are operating with wrong assumptions, so they are making mistakes and wasting money, without even knowing it.

Marketing professionals today are better educated than in the past, and they have access to much more data on buying behaviour. But the study of marketing is so young that we would be arrogant to believe that we know it all, or even that we have got the basics right yet. We can draw an analogy with medical practice. For centuries this noble profession has attracted some of the best and brightest people in society, who were typically far better educated than other professionals. Yet for 2,500 years these experts enthusiastically and universally taught and practised bloodletting (a generally useless and often fatal ‘cure’). Only very recently, about 80 years ago, medical professionals started doing the very opposite, and today blood transfusions save numerous lives each and every day. Marketing managers operate a bit like medieval doctors – working on anecdotal experience, impressions and myth-based explanations.

It would be arrogant to think that the current marketing ‘best practice’ does not contain many mistakes and erroneous assumptions. I used to teach some erroneous stuff to my university students; I know how easy it is to parrot a falsehood simply because that’s what we were taught to think and because it appears to make sense. This book challenges some of the conventional wisdom with empirical evidence. I hope you find this ‘myth-busting’ knowledge as liberating as it is useful.

# Marketing textbooks

Marketing prides itself on being a practical discipline, so marketing texts (textbooks, marketing magazines, consultant reports, etc.) should be full of answers to practical questions, such as:

* What will happen to sales if I change the price of the product?
* Why can I see the effect of price promotions in the sales data, but the advertising campaigns barely show up, if at all? Is advertising not generating sales?
* What is a reasonable cross-selling target?
* Will the new brand cannibalise sales from the current brand? If so, by * Should I pay double for a full-page newspaper ad or buy the half-page ad instead?
