Table 11.2 shows that there are four types of consumers a loyalty program can recruit and potentially influence (i.e. influence their loyalty towards the brand with the loyalty program).

**Table 11.2:** Types of customers who could join the loyalty program

This table presents a two-by-two matrix categorizing consumers based on their purchase level (light or heavy) and their level of loyalty (low or high). The matrix illustrates the desirability and likelihood of these consumer segments joining a loyalty program. Consumers with a light purchase level and low loyalty are the largest group but are unlikely to join, making them not particularly desirable. Light purchasers with high loyalty are likely to join but are considered undesirable. Heavy purchasers with low loyalty are very unlikely to join but are highly desirable. Finally, heavy purchasers with high loyalty are likely to join but are also deemed undesirable. The structure is comparative, contrasting different consumer segments' characteristics in relation to loyalty program engagement.

Most consumers fall into the top left-hand quadrant because most buyers are lighter-than-average consumers (of products in a particular category) and most of a brand’s buyers also buy other brands. A loyalty program will inevitably recruit some of these light consumers because there are so many of them. Most will become lapsed users of the program as they generally fail to accumulate sufficient points to qualify for rewards and so gradually forget about, or reject, the program (e.g. they lose the loyalty card). Hopefully a few of these consumers will become heavier buyers.

If a loyalty program only recruits highly loyal buyers (right-hand quadrants) it has little chance of generating any change; first, these people don’t need to change their behaviour to win rewards, and second, they can’t change anyway as they are already very loyal. It is because of these consumers that a loyalty program can have negative effects: it gives away rewards but gains no change in behaviour in return.

Consumers that fall into the lower left-hand are the most desirable consumers for a loyalty program to recruit. If a loyalty program reaches consumers who are heavy buyers of a category and who are not 100% loyal to a brand, then it is more likely to extract additional loyalty and sales. These heavy buyers have more loyalty to give; however, their motivation is not necessarily high as they will earn rewards anyway. What motivation they have is also easily countered by competitor loyalty programs and promotions. These heavy buyers are very aware of competitor offerings.

With this knowledge of the structure of the market, and the nature of loyalty programs, logic suggests that such programs have little chance of generating increased sales and profit.
