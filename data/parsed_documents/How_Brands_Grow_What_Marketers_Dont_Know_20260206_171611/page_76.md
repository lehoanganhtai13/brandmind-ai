Your competitors see that your customers are just like theirs, so there is nothing structural preventing them from stealing your customers. This is another reason why it’s not time for the marketing department to go home.

Given how stark this finding is, and how readily available customer profile data is, it seems odd that this discovery is a surprise to many marketers<sup>33</sup>. Perhaps it is due to us expecting to see differences. Marketing textbooks tell us that brands have been differentiated and targeted to specific segments. Therefore we expect them to sell to different sorts of customers. Also, many marketing directors find that they have a large portfolio of brands, many inherited in historic company acquisitions. They look for a reason why they have all these very similar brands and conclude that each must appeal to different sorts of buyers, whereas in reality they appeal to different buyers, but not different types of buyers (i.e. they appeal to the particular buyers that know them).

# Competition

The very good news is that there is nothing structural standing in the way of your brand growing; your competitor’s customers could be yours. The only problem is that you have competitors who are trying to do the same as you. Therefore, brands need capable marketing departments to defend them.

What then do these marketing laws mean for competition? Does a brand compete with all other brands in its category? How does a brand identify its nearest competitors? This is the topic of the next chapter.
