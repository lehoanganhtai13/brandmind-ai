More than the other owners of Harleys, people in this segment agree with statements such as:

* *most of the time my motorcycle is just parked*
* *I like wearing a helmet when riding*
* *I don’t know many other people that ride motorcycles.*

These Harley riders are also least likely to agree that, **“My bike is everything to me”**. Yet this group represents almost 50% of Harley-Davidson’s sales revenue.

At the other end of the spectrum, stereotypically fanatical Harley bikers earn the least but spend the most money each year on accessories for their bike. They are also the Harley owners most likely to like tattoos and drink beer; and the least likely to read a book. These people represent less than 10% of Harley owners and they are the least likely to have bought their bike new, so they represent a mere 3.5% of Harley-Davidson’s sales revenue.

The ‘Hog Heaven’ segment is the other owner group that might be classified as passionate brand loyalists; they disagree with statements like “I like bikes with plastic farings and engine covers”, and are most likely to agree with “When I’m on my bike people seem to be admiring me”. While many Harley owners in this segment are well paid, they spend the least on accessories for their bike and buy the smallest models. Consequently, they represent less than 10% of Harley-Davidson’s sales revenue.

The owners with the highest attitudinal loyalty (or ‘Harley zeal’) refers to the degree that respondents agreed with statements like, “I think Harleys are the best bikes in the world”, and disagreed with statements like “I like good bikes wherever they are made”, “I like the spacecraft look of bikes today”, and “All things considered, I think Japanese bikes are the best” (see Swinyard 1995). Owners who rated highest on attitudinal loyalty turn out to be worth the least to the company per customer. Additionally, they contribute little revenue because these passionately loyal segments are very small.
