This is a more prosaic picture than most marketing textbooks and consultants paint.

# LOVEMARKS?

> The following stories [are said to] reveal powerful bonds between consumer and brand !?!
>
> *Pamela, the case of falling in love*  
> Pamela, a single mom in her thirties, is ‘strongly attached’ to the brand of coffee she has bought for the past five years…her connection is affectively-laden, perhaps best compared to the notion of ‘falling in love’…the strong bond Pamela has with her coffee is at least in part rooted in its personification of ‘special qualities’ that collectively build Pamela’s self-worth and esteem.  
>
> While Pamela dwells on her passion for her coffee brand her intentions reveal only circumscribed commitment to the brand...Pamela is accepting of other potential brand partners…her faithfulness lies in her emotional bond with the brand, and not in formal pledges of fidelity or anticipated future commitments. She is “in love with it, not married to it”.
>
> *Sara, the case of adolescent best friendship*  
> Sara is a 23-year-old Midwesterner who has recently relocated to the East Coast to pursue graduate school. Her coffee brand helps Sara reinforce a positive identity in a developmentally crucial time in her life. In addition to leaving the midwestern farm that defines her legacy, Sara has recently declared her sexual orientation as a lesbian. In some sense, the overt self-indulgence implied in the brand helps Sara explicitly maintain her sense of self-respect in the face of social challenges to her pronouncement.

Pity the poor marketing directors. It’s not enough to merely build and maintain sales and deliver profits to stockholders; they are told they also have to get consumers to feel a deep, passionate commitment to their brand. It’s no longer sufficient to have consumers who pay money to buy the brand; they have to also love the brand.
