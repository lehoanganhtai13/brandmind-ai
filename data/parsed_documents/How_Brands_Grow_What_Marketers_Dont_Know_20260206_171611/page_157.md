# Can price cuts be profitable?

An important point to make is that even very large increases in volume may still not make any extra contribution to profit. This is because, when a price is cut, the contribution margin for each item is cut even more. For example, if the normal contribution margin on a product is 50%, a 10% price cut shaves 20% off the contribution margin. In the Totten and Block (1994) example (previously discussed), a price cut as reported of 45% would eliminate virtually all the contribution margin for a normal packaged goods brand; therefore, the brand is being sold at close to manufacturing cost. So while the brand could sell 400% more volume, it would not make any more profit, because there is almost no contribution margin on each item sold.

The short-term profitability of a price promotion depends on these three factors:

* the contribution margin of the brand at normal price  
* the depth of the price cut  
* the price elasticity of the brand.

Using these three factors we can easily work out ‘break-even’ scenarios that show how much extra volume needs to be sold to break even from a price reduction. If the contribution margin is low to begin with, a massive increase in sales is needed to break even. If the contribution margin is high, a price cut can earn more profit, even from a modest increase in sales. This is because every extra unit still carries enough contribution to pay for the price cut. Three example scenarios are shown in Table 10.2. The first example shows that a brand selling at the normal price and earning a 30% contribution margin and employing a 10% price cut must sell 50% more just to make the same amount of money. If the promotion creates an increase in sales of anything less than 50%, the brand will lose money!

**Table 10.2: Break-even scenarios**

This data presents a comparative analysis of the sales volume increase required to maintain the current contribution margin across different price reduction scenarios and brand contribution margins. The structure is comparative, examining three distinct brand contribution margins (30%, 40%, and 50%) against three price reduction percentages (5%, 10%, and 20%). For each price reduction, the table quantifies the necessary percentage increase in sales volume to offset the reduced margin per unit. Notably, higher initial contribution margins generally require smaller sales volume increases to compensate for the same price reduction. Conversely, lower initial contribution margins necessitate significantly larger sales volume increases to achieve the same financial outcome. The data highlights the sensitivity of contribution margin to price reductions, particularly for brands with lower initial margins.

Such large increases in sales are needed because a price reduction results in selling lots of volume to people who would have bought the brand anyway, at full price. Therefore, the incremental volume has to be high to ‘pay for’ the lost margin on what we can call the baseline volume.
