Our combined knowledge has grown in leaps and bounds, and we live in comparative luxury.

Let’s return for a moment to the case of our learned but bloodletting doctors. For centuries they bled patients for almost every possible ailment, indeed many advocated bleeding simply to maintain good health. For most of the last millennium bloodletting was as trusted and popular in Europe as aspirin is today (Starr 1998). 7

Over the years, doctors must have killed hundreds of thousands of patients. Among them was US President George Washington, who died when his doctors bled him vigorously to cure a sore throat. The doctor of another US legislator once wrote that he had treated his patient by relieving him of 165 ounces of blood in five days (almost all the blood in his body!). The doctor wrote, ‘he died … had we taken a still greater quantity [of blood] the event might perhaps have been more fortunate’ (Starr, 1998). Apart from a few rare medical conditions, bleeding does no good whatsoever. So how did these well-meaning and well-educated doctors get it so terribly wrong for so long?

First, it was because they believed untested theories that advocated bleeding. Like all practitioners they were, probably without realising it, deeply theoretical. The ancient Greeks (e.g. Hippocrates) developed a theory that all illness resulted from an imbalance of humours; bleeding and purging were common ways of addressing such imbalances. This humoural imbalance theory dominated medical thinking in Europe and the Middle East for 2000 years because no one tested if this really was the cause of illness.

Second, bleeding continued because no-one conducted systematic research into its effects. If patients recovered from their illness then bleeding was credited as the cure; if they died … well they were sick after all! Doctors worked using their impressions, assumptions, commonsense, accepted wisdom, and scattered bits of data. This is very similar to the working practice of marketing managers today.

Adding to the danger, doctors overestimated how much blood was in the human body – no-one checked properly. And they underestimated how long it would take the body to manufacture new blood – again no one checked.

Douglas Starr (1998) argues that bleeding was also popular because it gave doctors a sense of control. It produced dramatic results – patients fainted (for a long while this was considered a good thing). Patients demanded that doctors be seen to do something, and bleeding fulfilled this requirement. It’s not hard to see similarities with many marketing interventions (like price promotions, bursts of advertising, and rushing into ‘new media’ like proverbial lemmings<sup>8</sup>).
