This shows that brand choice is a trivial task, as is the choice of deciding whether or not to buy from the product category. So buyers do not spend a great deal of time comparing brands in a category, and so differentiation (relative to other brands) is not noticed. This realisation is counter to many models of information processing; buyers are thought to weigh up brands on the merits of their relative attributes (e.g. Alpert 1971; Fishbein & Ajzen 1975; Green, et al 1981), which implies that buyers know about the differences between brands. However, what empirical evidence shows is that buyers seem to know something about the brands they use, and very little about the ones they don’t. This results in the much lower response levels from non-users (compared to that of users).

The main implication is that it isn’t essential for marketers to convince buyers that a product is different before they buy it. This should take a considerable weight off marketers’ shoulders, because our data shows that such a task must be near impossible. Instead, marketers should focus on achieving the things that do make customers buy a product.

Brands are different from one another, and they are perceived as such, but differentiation plays a small role in how brands compete. Consider three brands that are clearly functionally different (and maybe different in other ways too): Pizza Hut, McDonald’s and KFC. Respectively, they sell pizzas, burgers, and fried chicken. So we should expect that McDonald’s primarily competes with other burger providers (Wimpys, Burger King, Hungry Jacks, Carl’s Jr, etc.); that Pizza Hut competes with other pizza chains (Dominos, Pizza Pizza, Little Caesars, Papa John’s, Pizza Haven); and that KFC competes with other chicken outlets (Harold’s Chicken Shack, Bojangles, Oporto, Chesters, Red Rooster etc.). According to textbook logic, McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut would not compete against one another (or very indirectly). Of course this is nonsense; they are direct competitors; they compete in one big fast food category. Rather than working to differentiate themselves and splinter this fast food category, they actually try to reduce their differentiation; for example, McDonald’s advertises that it offers chicken (burgers), KFC advertises that it offers (chicken) burgers and Pizza Hut advertises that it sells chicken (pizza). [66] UPDATE: In 2011 Millward Brown published independent data, in effect a replication of our work across more brands, countries, categories and a different questionnaire with different perceived differentiation questions.
