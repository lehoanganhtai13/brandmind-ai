  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of several banks, detailing their market share and customer defection rates. The structure is a direct comparison of individual entities against two key metrics. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) exhibits the highest market share at 32%, with a relatively low defection rate of 3%. In contrast, Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and State Government Insurance Office (STG) show progressively lower market shares, ranging from 13% down to 6%, with defection rates between 4% and 5%. Smaller institutions like BankSA and Adelaide Bank have the lowest market shares at 1%, but notably higher defection rates of 5% and 7% respectively, indicating a potential inverse relationship between size and customer loyalty among the smaller players.",
