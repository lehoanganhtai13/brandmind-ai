  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on the percentage of buyers who also purchased other brands. The table is structured with brands A, B, C, and D listed along the rows and columns. The diagonal entries, representing the percentage of buyers who also bought the same brand, are all 100%. The off-diagonal entries are empty, implying no data is presented for buyers of one brand also purchasing another. This structure highlights a self-purchasing pattern for each brand individually, without indicating any cross-brand purchasing relationships or cannibalization effects. The overarching structure is comparative, examining each brand's purchasing behavior in isolation.",
