  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of customer agreement with the statement \"friendly and helpful\" across four Australian banks: CBA, Westpac, NAB, and ANZ. It tracks agreement levels across two survey response levels (RL1 and RL2) and calculates the repeat rate (RR) for those who initially agreed. CBA shows the highest initial agreement (30% in RL1) and the highest agreement in the second survey (35% in RL2), alongside the highest repeat rate of 57%. Westpac and NAB exhibit identical initial agreement (19% in RL1) and second survey agreement (20% in RL2), with repeat rates of 48% and 45% respectively. ANZ has the lowest initial agreement (16% in RL1) and second survey agreement (17% in RL2), with a repeat rate of 44%. The data indicates an average repeat rate of 49% across these banks and a strong positive correlation (r=0.98) between the initial agreement level and the repeat rate, suggesting that higher initial agreement is strongly associated with sustained agreement.",
