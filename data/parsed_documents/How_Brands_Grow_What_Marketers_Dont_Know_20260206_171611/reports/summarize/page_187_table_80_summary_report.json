  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines strategies for reinforcing or building mental and physical availability of a brand, categorized by their likelihood of success. Strategies very likely to reinforce availability include broadening distribution, gaining new distribution channels, consistent use of distinctive brand assets, consistent advertising, broad-reaching media, gaining shelf space in new store areas, and offering a broad range of product varieties and pack formats. Strategies with low reach, unlikely to reinforce availability, encompass coupons and price promotions, packaging changes, loyalty programs, competitions, and bursting/pulsing advertising. Finally, strategies deemed unknown or risky include advertising with new information, temporary product variants, comparative advertising, and suspense advertising where the brand name is hidden. The structure is comparative, evaluating different marketing tactics based on their potential impact on brand availability.",
