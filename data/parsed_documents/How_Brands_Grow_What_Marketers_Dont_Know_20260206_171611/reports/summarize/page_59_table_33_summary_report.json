  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of buyer distribution based on the number of purchases made. The structure is a direct mapping, showing the percentage of buyers corresponding to each purchase quantity. A significant portion of buyers, 11%, made zero purchases, while 18% made a single purchase, representing the largest individual segments. As the number of purchases increases, the percentage of buyers generally decreases, with a notable drop after the first purchase. For instance, 14% of buyers made two purchases, and this figure steadily declines to 1% for buyers making between 12 and 15 purchases. The data indicates a sharp decrease in buyer participation beyond a certain threshold, with very few buyers making a high volume of purchases, and a small fraction (1%) making 20 or more purchases.",
