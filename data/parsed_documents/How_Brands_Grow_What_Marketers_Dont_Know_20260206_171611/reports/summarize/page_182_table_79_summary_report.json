  "summary_markdown": "This data visually represents a market share distribution, likely illustrating how different market segments contribute to overall market share. The structure appears to be a comparative or correlational display, mapping a range of market share percentages from 0 to 100 against a scale that also ranges from 0 to 10. The presence of a '+' symbol suggests an additive or cumulative relationship between the two scales, implying that as the value on the 0-10 scale increases, the weighted distribution of market share also increases, reaching a maximum of 100%. The table's layout indicates a direct relationship where higher values on the initial scale correspond to higher weighted distributions of market share.",
