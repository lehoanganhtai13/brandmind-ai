  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of market share for regular and diet soft drinks within a specific demographic group. It aims to illustrate the relative popularity and consumer preference between these two product categories. The structure is straightforward, with distinct columns for each soft drink type and rows (implicitly, though not detailed in the provided snippet) that would represent different demographic segments or time periods. The core comparison lies in the percentage of market share held by regular versus diet soft drinks, allowing for an assessment of which product type is more dominant or preferred within the targeted demographic. The data would likely reveal trends or disparities in consumption patterns, highlighting the success of one category over the other.",
