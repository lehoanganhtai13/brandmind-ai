  "summary_markdown": "This data illustrates a comparative analysis of two hypothetical brands, Dell-icious and AppleCore, both of equal size, to determine their resulting market share. The comparison focuses on two key metrics: annual market penetration, representing the percentage of the market that purchases from the brand annually, and the number of purchases made per buyer per annum. Dell-icious exhibits a higher annual market penetration at 32% but a lower number of purchases per buyer per annum (3), leading to a market share of 14%. Conversely, AppleCore has a lower annual market penetration of 16% but a higher number of purchases per buyer per annum (6), also resulting in a market share of 14%. This demonstrates that different combinations of market penetration and purchase frequency can yield identical market shares.",
