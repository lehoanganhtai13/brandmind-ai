  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically detailing the percentage of buyers of one brand who also purchase other specified brands. The structure is a matrix where rows represent the primary brand purchased by a buyer, and columns indicate the percentage of those buyers who also purchased the brand listed in the column header. For instance, 21% of Farmers' Union buyers also bought Dairy Vale, while 43% of Dairy Vale buyers also purchased Farmers' Union. The diagonal is marked with a hyphen, indicating no self-purchase is being measured. An \"Average\" row is included, summarizing the average cross-purchase percentage for each brand across all other brands. This highlights inter-brand purchasing relationships and potential brand loyalty or competitive overlap within this market.",
