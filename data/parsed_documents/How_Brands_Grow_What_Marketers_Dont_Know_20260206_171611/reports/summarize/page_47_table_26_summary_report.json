  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines two distinct marketing strategies: Mass Marketing and Target Marketing. Mass Marketing adopts a broad approach, aiming to sell to all buyers within a product category, characterized by a large number of occasional purchasers and a tolerance for weak customer loyalty and relationships. In contrast, Target Marketing employs a more focused approach, deliberately excluding some category buyers to concentrate efforts on specific groups. These targeted groups can be either those who purchase the brand more frequently (heavier buyers) or a clearly defined segment of individuals with shared characteristics. The core difference lies in the scope of the customer base and the emphasis placed on building relationships versus maximizing reach.",
