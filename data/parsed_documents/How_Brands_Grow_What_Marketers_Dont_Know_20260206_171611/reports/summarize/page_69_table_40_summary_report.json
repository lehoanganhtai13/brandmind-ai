  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of brand preferences between males and females, focusing on three specific Yorkie chocolate bar varieties. The structure is a simple two-by-four matrix, with 'Gender' as the primary categorical variable and 'Total brand' and three distinct Yorkie flavors serving as the measured attributes. For each gender, the table quantifies the total brand engagement and the specific engagement with 'Yorkie - Milk', 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit', and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. The data reveals differing preferences, with males showing higher engagement in total brand and 'Yorkie - Milk', while females exhibit a stronger preference for 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit' and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. This highlights a gender-based divergence in the consumption patterns of these particular chocolate products.",
