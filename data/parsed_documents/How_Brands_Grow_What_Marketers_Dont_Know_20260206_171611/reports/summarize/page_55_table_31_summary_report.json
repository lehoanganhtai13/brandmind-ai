  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of various product categories, detailing the percentage of brand volume attributed to their top 20% of consumers. The structure highlights a concentration of consumption within a small consumer segment across diverse product types. Soft drinks exhibit the highest concentration, with 64% of brand volume coming from their top consumers, followed closely by Refrigerated Yoghurt at 60%. Other categories like Dry Cat food and Dog food, and Breakfast cereals show a significant, though slightly lower, concentration at 56% and 54% respectively. As the list progresses, the concentration generally decreases, with products like Shampoo (42%) and Fabric Softeners - Aerosol (35%) showing less pronounced loyalty or reliance on a core group of heavy users. The overall average across all listed categories indicates that, on average, 50% of brand volume is driven by the top 20% of consumers, underscoring a common pattern of concentrated demand across these consumer goods.",
