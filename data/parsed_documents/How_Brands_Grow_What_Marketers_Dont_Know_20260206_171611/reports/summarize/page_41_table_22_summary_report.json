  "summary_markdown": "This data depicts a customer switching dynamic between a \"Big Brand\" and a \"Small Brand.\" The core relationship is a bidirectional customer flow, with \"100 customers switch each way\" indicating an equal number of customers moving from the Big Brand to the Small Brand and vice-versa. The structure highlights a comparative aspect, contrasting the customer base turnover rates. Specifically, the Small Brand experiences a higher proportion of its customer base switching away, implying a greater churn rate for the smaller entity compared to the larger one. This suggests a competitive landscape where the Small Brand, despite receiving customers from the Big Brand, struggles with customer retention.",
