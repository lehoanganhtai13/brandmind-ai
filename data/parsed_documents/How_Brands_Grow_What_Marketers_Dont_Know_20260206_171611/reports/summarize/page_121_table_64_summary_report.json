The categories are evaluated based on the percentage of users who believe the category is different, unique, or either different or unique. Spirits show the highest perception of difference (20%) and uniqueness (27%), leading to the highest combined perception of 36%. Conversely, Electronics and Water exhibit lower perception rates across all metrics, with Electronics at 4% for difference and 6% for uniqueness, and Water at 6% for both. Other categories like Supermarkets, Skincare, and F&V drinks fall in the mid-range, with varying degrees of perceived difference and uniqueness.
