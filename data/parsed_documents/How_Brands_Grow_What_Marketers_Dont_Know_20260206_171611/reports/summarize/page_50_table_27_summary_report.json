  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of cola buyer purchasing frequency, specifically for Coca-Cola, detailing the percentage of buyers who purchase at a given frequency per year. The structure is a direct mapping of purchase instances to buyer proportions. It shows that a significant portion of buyers, 32%, purchase Coca-Cola once per year, with decreasing percentages for higher purchase frequencies. Notably, 18% buy twice annually, and 10% buy three times. As the frequency increases, the percentage of buyers diminishes, with 7% buying four times and 4% buying five times. Frequencies beyond five purchases show progressively smaller buyer segments, with 1% buying ten times and a cumulative less than 0.5% buying between 13 and 52 times per year, indicating a concentration of purchasing behavior at lower frequencies.",
