  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a framework for evaluating strategic assumptions, categorizing them into three possible states: True, False, or Don't Know. The structure is a simple two-column format, with the first column listing various \"Strategic Assumptions\" and the second column providing a space to indicate the assessed truth value of each assumption. This implies a process of critical analysis where each underlying belief or premise of a strategy is systematically examined and validated or invalidated. The \"Don't Know\" option acknowledges that some assumptions may not be immediately verifiable, suggesting a need for further investigation or data collection. The overall purpose appears to be the rigorous assessment of the foundational elements of a strategic plan to ensure its viability and effectiveness.",
