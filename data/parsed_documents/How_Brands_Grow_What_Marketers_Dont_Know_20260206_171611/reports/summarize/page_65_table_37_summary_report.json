  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of beer brand buyers across demographic categories, including gender, age group, and earnings. The data is structured to show the percentage distribution of Men and Women buyers for each brand, alongside the percentage of buyers within the \"<29\" and \"50-59\" age brackets, and the percentage of buyers earning less than \"$30\" and \"$50\" thousand. Brands like Coors, Canadian, Bud, Oland, Blue, Sleeman, Corona, Modelo, and Miller are individually profiled. An overall \"Average\" row synthesizes the data, indicating a general trend of male dominance in beer purchasing, a significant proportion of younger (<29) buyers, and a substantial segment of buyers earning below $50,000 annually. The structure facilitates a direct comparison of buyer demographics across different beer brands and highlights overall market tendencies.",
