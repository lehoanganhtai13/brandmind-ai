  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of the number of different brands bought against the number of category purchases. The structure appears to be a distribution or frequency count, where specific ranges of category purchases correspond to a percentage of different brands bought. Specifically, approximately 40% of category purchases involve buying only 1 brand, while the percentage decreases as the number of different brands bought increases. A significant portion, around 32.2%, of category purchases involve buying 6-9 different brands, and 24.4% involve 15-17 different brands. The data further indicates that 16.6% of category purchases involve 22-25 different brands, and 8.8% involve 29-31 different brands. A very small percentage, 1.0%, is associated with the highest number of brands bought, though the exact upper limit for this category is not explicitly defined beyond the 29-31 range.",
