  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a comparative framework for advertising strategies, contrasting a \"Past World View\" with a \"New World View.\" The \"Past World View\" emphasizes core advertising functions such as Positioning, Message Comprehension, Unique Selling Propositions, Persuasion, Teaching, and Campaign Bursts. In contrast, the \"New World View\" reframes these concepts with a focus on Salience, Getting Noticed and Emotional Response, Relevant Associations, Refreshing & Building Memory Structures, Reaching, and Continuous Presence. This structure suggests a shift from a more direct, feature-driven approach to one that prioritizes brand awareness, emotional connection, and sustained visibility in the consumer's mind.",
