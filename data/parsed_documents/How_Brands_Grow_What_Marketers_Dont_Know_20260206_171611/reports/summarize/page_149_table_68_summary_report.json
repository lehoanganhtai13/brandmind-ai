  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of buyer segments across different price tiers, illustrating their purchasing behavior. The primary buyer groups are categorized by their general price perception: Below average, Cheap, Expensive, and Above average, with an overall Average buyer group also included. Each buyer group's overall market share is indicated, alongside the percentage of buyers within that group who also purchase products in other specific price tiers, denoted by '-', '—', '++', and '+'. For instance, 35% of buyers perceive products as \"Below average\" and within this segment, 64% also purchase \"—\" tier products, 57% purchase \"++\" tier products, and 36% purchase \"+\" tier products. Conversely, the \"Cheap\" buyer segment, representing 31% of the market, shows 69% also buying \"-\" tier products, 51% buying \"++\" tier products, and 30% buying \"+\" tier products. The \"Expensive\" segment (27% share) exhibits 66% purchasing \"-\" tier products, 55% purchasing \"—\" tier products, and 39% purchasing \"+\" tier products. Finally, the \"Above average\" segment (7% share) shows 78% purchasing \"-\" tier products, 61% purchasing \"—\" tier products, and 73% purchasing \"++\" tier products. The \"Average\" buyer group, with a 25% share, demonstrates a consistent tendency to purchase across all other tiers, with 71% buying \"-\", 60% buying \"—\", 60% buying \"++\", and 35% buying \"+\". This structure highlights cross-purchasing patterns and the overlap in consumer preferences across distinct price categories.",
