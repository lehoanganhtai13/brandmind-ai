  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a distribution of buyers across different percentage brackets, indicating a comparative structure. The primary observation is a sharp decline in buyer percentages as the percentage bracket increases. Specifically, 59% of buyers fall into the 0% bracket, representing the largest segment. This percentage rapidly diminishes to 13% in the 1% bracket and further to 8% in the 2% bracket. The proportion of buyers continues to decrease steadily, reaching 6% for 3% and 4% for 4%. Beyond the 4% bracket, the buyer percentages become progressively smaller, with 3% for 5%, 2% for 6%, and 1% for 7%, 8%, 9%, and 10%. From the 11% bracket onwards, the percentage of buyers drops to 0%, indicating no buyers in these higher brackets. This pattern highlights a concentration of buyers at the lower end of the percentage spectrum.",
