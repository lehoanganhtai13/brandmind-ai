The first table has a primary header 'Brand Performance' and a second header row with 7 columns. The second table has a primary header 'Customers' and a second header row with 8 columns, one of which is empty. There is no clear overlap or continuation that would suggest they belong to the same table. Therefore, they are treated as separate."
