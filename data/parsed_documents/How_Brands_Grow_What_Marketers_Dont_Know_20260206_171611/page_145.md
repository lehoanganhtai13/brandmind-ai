Advertising helps this signalling. Few people drive a Mercedes-Benz, but everyone knows this is an expensive car brand. Advertising tells us this, which means that people who drive Mercedes signal their wealth by driving this brand. This wouldn’t work if the general population didn’t know what a Mercedes looks like and know that it is an expensive brand.

However, marketers often over-estimate the effect of signalling. Some categories aren’t very symbolic, and few consumers think a brand will change what their friends think of them. Also, much of the symbolic character of brands comes from usage, observation and word-of-mouth rather than from advertising.

The implication of this is not that a brand will benefit enormously from advertising that tries to make it cool amongst non-buyers. A more sensible implication is that symbolic brands and even super expensive luxury brands often need to advertise widely. Advertising for luxury watches is not just directed towards billionaires, partly because most people aren’t billionaires and most people who buy luxury watches aren’t billionaires.

# Priming

It is a well established psychological phenomenon that people prefer objects and brands that they have seen more often. This is an ‘exposure’ effect. Recent research has shown that this effect can apply to exposures that consumers are barely aware of. Research has also revealed that recent exposures to associated cues can enhance the probability of purchase. For example, apparently college students returning to campus after Halloween rated orange brands more favourably and exposure to multiple pictures of dogs increased the probability of ‘choosing’ the Puma brand of sports shoes (because people associate dogs with cats) (Berger & Fitzsimons 2008). This unusual effect isn’t well documented outside of experimental conditions, so it’s unclear how reliable or strong this effect really is in the real world. It is also not clear how competing cues interact and possibly cancel each other out. It’s possible that this exposure effect is simply a salience effect. It is however further evidence that advertising can, at least potentially, affect sales without making a sales pitch.

# Effective advertising

A simple (but not easy) recipe for effective advertising is:
