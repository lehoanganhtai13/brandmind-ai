Analyze the document structure in this folder and create a global_map.json file.

Follow your cognitive workflow:
1. RECONNAISSANCE: Find the Table of Contents
2. TARGET ACQUISITION: For each section, verify location and pinpoint exact line numbers
3. CONTEXTUALIZATION: Create rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities
4. ARTIFACT GENERATION: Write the complete JSON to /global_map.json

Remember: Use write_file tool to save the final JSON. Do not output JSON in chat.

💭 Thinking:
  **My Approach to Markdown Document Analysis**

Okay, so the task is clear: I need to generate a `global_map.json` file reflecting the structure and content of the markdown files in this directory. I've been asked to approach this systematically, which is always the best way to tackle a complex data task. My initial thought is, this sounds like a great problem for a multi-pass approach. I think of it as a methodical hunt – a scout, a hunter, an analyst, and finally, a scribe.

First, I'll dive into *Reconnaissance*. I need to quickly establish the lay of the land. The key here will be identifying and understanding the Table of Contents within these markdown files. That'll be my starting point to infer structure. This phase is crucial; if I don't grasp the basic document hierarchy, the rest is just noise.

Next, I will *Target Acquire*, meaning I must precisely locate each section within those documents and get the line numbers. I can't rely on formatting alone – I need exact positions for this to work correctly.

Then comes *High-Density Contextualization*. This is the core intellectual work. I'll need to generate a nuanced summary for each section, focusing on key concepts and entities. This isn't just about a keyword search; it's about semantic understanding and relation identification. This is where the real value lies, turning raw information into insights.

Finally, the *Artifact Generation* phase. Time to be the Scribe. Once I have the fully analyzed and contextualized information, I will write the final `global_map.json` file. It's the culmination of everything I've done thus far. I'm going to start by exploring the file system. Let's see what's in there.

  Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Initial Assessment of Markdown Files**

Right, so I'm presented with a slew of `page_X.md` files, probably a documentation set or some content organized this way. My first instinct, as always, is to navigate the structure. Forget brute-force reading – that's inefficient. I need a jumping-off point. Given the naming convention, a Table of Contents is the most likely candidate for providing that. I'll scan the initial files, maybe the first three or four, looking for any sign of a `[[TOC]]`, a well-formed markdown table, or a structured heading indicating a listing of contents. If I find something, I can quickly map the file organization, probably utilizing a simple Python script to parse the files and establish relationships between documents. It's all about finding that central point of reference to build my understanding from.

**Initial Assessment: Navigating the Landscape**

Alright, let's dive in. First, I'm going to quickly skim the beginning – just the first few pages, really – to find the Table of Contents. No need for a deep dive initially; I want the overview. Knowing the structure of the document, the headings and subheadings, gives me a critical understanding of the author's argument and the scope of what they’re trying to achieve, at which point I can begin to assess whether it merits my full attention. This allows for an efficient initial triage, pinpointing areas that might be immediately relevant to my current work and avoiding time wasted on irrelevant sections.

**My Approach to Content Discovery**

Right, let's get down to brass tacks. I've got a pile of content here: `page_1.md` through `page_5.md`. My initial strategy is clear: I'm not going to dive headfirst into the details just yet. What I need *first* is the overarching structure. I'm going to scan these files specifically looking for the Table of Contents, or at least anything that functions like it - headings, lists of topics, whatever gives me the organizational skeleton of this material. The ToC is the key to understanding the landscape before I start exploring the specific areas. Knowing the structure will help me navigate and understand any content and quickly identify what topics and content is relevant.

**Navigating the Introduction**

Alright, I've just scanned the first five pages, expecting to find the Table of Contents, but no luck. It's not immediately apparent. Given the likely structure of this type of document, it's reasonable to assume it might be further in. I'll read through the next five pages now and see if the ToC appears. It is standard practice. I will continue my search, staying focused on the potential placement.

Alright, I'm currently assessing the document's structure, focusing on the expected presence of a Table of Contents. I've thoroughly reviewed the content up to page 10. No luck on a ToC there. Now, based on common document design, it seems reasonable that the ToC could be positioned on or before page 15. I'll need to expand the search; I'll scan pages 11 through 15 closely, as that is where I would expect to find it.

  Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert's perspective:

**Initial Assessment: Navigational Deficit**

Alright, chapter one, page eleven... and still no formal Table of Contents (ToC). A bit unusual, especially this far in. Let me quickly double-check the usual suspects – preface, acknowledgements – just in case my initial scan missed something subtly placed. I've already checked the standard locations.

Hold on, maybe I'm overlooking it. It could be tucked away further into the preliminary materials, or perhaps there's an unconventional placement. Time for a targeted search. I'll fire up `grep`; a simple search for "Contents" should pinpoint its location, assuming it's present. It's a fundamental element for navigation, so let's see where they've hidden it. This is a bit inefficient; I hope they're not trying to be overly clever with the layout.

**Navigating Unfamiliar Territory**

Well, this isn't quite what I anticipated. Hmm, I need to figure out the structure of this document or set of files. Let me take a stab at the usual suspects. A formal "Table of Contents" might be hidden somewhere, or maybe it's just a simple list I can review again. Sometimes, especially in these less-than-perfectly-organized datasets, the index is tucked away at the very end or exists as an entirely separate, linked document.

Alright, a more targeted approach. Let's try a search. I'll scan for the keyword "Chapter." That's a reliable indicator of a structured document. Hopefully, that will highlight the sections.

  Here's my thought process, as if I were reviewing those chapters:

**Analyzing Chapter Structure**

Alright, I've got a chapter list in front of me. My initial step is to quickly scan through it. I need to get a high-level overview of how this material is organized. Alongside that, I need to look for any indications of larger structural components like "Part" designations. Those would likely define the major thematic or chronological groupings of the book, which will influence how I ultimately understand the flow and progression of ideas presented. I want to build a hierarchical understanding of the document right off the bat. Knowing the presence or absence of "Part" divisions will inform my mental map of the whole.

💭 Thinking:
  **Initial Assessment of Chapter Organization**

Alright, no "Part" delineations – good. Straight to business with the chapters themselves. I'm taking a quick scan here, noting the page numbers as a preliminary outline. Chapter 1 is on page 11, and we have a fairly linear progression, each chapter starting on a new page. Interesting that Chapter 5 is explicitly titled "Our Buyers Are Different," indicating that it might focus on buyer behavior, and that might be a key differentiator in this framework. Now, rather than just noting the structure, let's drill down and get a grasp of the chapter titles. Knowing the full titles and a general description of the chapter contents will allow me to assess the scope and flow of the information presented.

💭 Thinking:
  **My Initial Assessment of the Document**

Okay, here's what I've got. It looks like I've got a fairly comprehensive marketing resource here. I've got a clear table of contents, and I'm seeing it's broken down into chapters with pretty intriguing titles. First off, I see the following chapters: Chapter 1 is about **Evidence-based Marketing** (page 11). Chapter 2 seems to be diving into **How Do Brands Grow?** (page 25). Then we have **How To Grow Your Customer Base** (page 39) in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 then looks to delve into **Which Customers Matter Most?** (page 47). Chapter 5 shifts gears to **Our Buyers Are Different** (page 63). I wonder how this differs from Chapter 4? Following up with **Who Do You Really Compete With?** (page 77) in Chapter 6 seems like an interesting direction to take. Chapter 7 focuses on **Passionate Customer Commitment** (page 89) and then Chapter 8 looks like it may get into the weeds of marketing with **Differentiation Versus Distinctiveness** (page 111). Chapter 9 promises to uncover **How Advertising Really Works** (page 130), a perennial question, and Chapter 10 tackles **What Price Promotions Really Do** (page 147). Following up with Chapter 11, it looks like **Why Loyalty Programs Don’t Work** (page 162), which is always a juicy topic and Chapter 12: **Mental and Physical Availability** (page 169) - seems like an insightful exploration of accessibility. Chapter 13 gets to the underlying principles with **The Scientific Laws** (page 200) and finally Chapter 14 - **Frequently Asked Questions** (page 204).

Before getting into the meat of the content, I also see a few preliminary sections: First, is the **Author (Byron Sharp)** (page 4) - I need to double-check that page order later as it looks like the **Preface** is on page 6. It starts with the **Contributors** (page 5), followed by the **Acknowledgements** (page 9) and **Special Thanks** (page 10), and the **E-book Version** (page 10). I'll have to see if there is an **Index** or a **Bibliography** at the end. Total page count, I'm seeing is 208. It feels like a solid foundation, and I'm eager to dive in.

  **Mapping the Structure: A Quick Verification**

Okay, so I've got the initial section list for this document, including front matter and chapters, and now it's time to map the exact page numbers to line up with the book. I need to ensure these page numbers are correct, since any deviation will mean the document is mis-indexed.

Here's the current roster of elements to verify: "Author (Byron Sharp)", "Contributors", "Preface", "The most important knowledge contained in this book", "Examples in this book", "Acknowledgements", "Special thanks", "E-book version", and then the chapters, starting with "Chapter 1: Evidence-based Marketing" and running through "Chapter 14: Frequently Asked Questions."

However, I just noticed something that needs immediate attention. The "A fine future for marketing" section and "Chapter 13: The Scientific Laws" are both listed as starting on page 200. That doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that page quickly.

Aha! Page 200 reveals that "A fine future for marketing" is positioned *before* "Chapter 13." Specifically, the section is a sub-header on line 11 of the page, while Chapter 13 begins on line 21.

Before I move on, I need to confirm whether any other sections appear between Chapter 12 (starts on page 169) and the start of "A Fine Future for Marketing" and Chapter 13.

  Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Locating the Chapter Break**

Alright, I need to pinpoint the conclusion of Chapter 12. It's a key section, and I need to reference it precisely. Let me quickly scan page 199. That's a reasonable place to start, given the typical pacing of this kind of text. From my experience, publishers tend to keep chapters to a manageable length, and 199 sounds like a plausible location for the break. I'll mentally note the context there, cross-reference it with the surrounding content, and then I'll have a good handle on where Chapter 12 actually concludes.

  **My Initial Scan of the Text's Structure**

Okay, so Chapter 12 wraps up on page 199. "A Fine Future for Marketing" kicks off on page 200, right before Chapter 13. I'm going to quickly map out the document's sections and grab some line numbers. It's time to refine my mental model of this book.

I'm starting with a fresh look at the front matter. Let's see...

*   Page 1: Document information. That's a given.
*   Page 2: E-book Edition details. Good to know.
*   Page 3: Reviews of *How Brands Grow*. Always interesting to see the positioning.
*   Page 4: The author, Byron Sharp. Need to know my competition.
*   Page 5: Contributors. Helpful for context.
*   Page 6: The preface. Always critical for intent.
*   Page 7: Seems to have "Towards a new view of marketing priorities" (Table 2) and a section titled, "The most important knowledge contained in this book". That's promising.
*   Page 9: Examples used in the book, Acknowledgements. Important for sourcing.
*   Page 10: Special thanks, E-book version details. Standard stuff.
*   Page 11: Chapter 1. That's the real starting point.

Now, I'm going to leverage `line_search` to pinpoint those section headers precisely. This'll allow me to navigate and reference key areas more efficiently, allowing me to build my model for how the information is presented.

💭 Thinking:
  **Organizing the Book's Structure**

Okay, here's the plan. I've successfully pinpointed the exact locations of the front matter components. I have the precise file and line numbers for the **Author** information, located at `page_4.md`, line 11. I also know where to find the **Contributors** information (`page_5.md`, line 11), the **Preface** (`page_6.md`, line 11), and what I consider the heart of the matter - **The most important knowledge contained in this book** at (`page_7.md`, line 18). I have identified the locations for **Examples in this book** (`page_9.md`, line 11) and the **Acknowledgements** (`page_9.md`, line 22). Plus, I know where to look for **Special thanks** (`page_10.md`, line 15) and details about the **E-book version** (`page_10.md`, line 23). Now that's handled.

Next step: I need to nail down the precise coordinates for all the individual chapters. And while I'm at it, I'll make sure to get the location of "Reviews of How Brands Grow" (Page 3). It makes sense to build this index meticulously to allow for a comprehensive mapping of the work.

💭 Thinking:
  **Refining the Contextualization Phase**

Okay, I'm getting a good grip on the document's structure. I've successfully collected most of the necessary coordinates. I've also verified that there isn't any content beyond Chapter 14, and page 208 seems to be the final page, containing the FAQs.

Now, it's time to update the todo list and move into Phase 3: Contextualization. My goal here is to generate summaries for each section. To save time and tokens, I will leverage the subagent for this task. The crucial question is whether to handle these sections individually or in batches. I've decided to parallelize the summarization process using the `task` tool, to increase efficiency.

Before I launch the subagents, I need to make sure the section information is perfectly accurate. I will now refine the list of sections, including their precise start and end pages, along with their corresponding line numbers, ensuring there are no errors in my coordinates.

Now I am ready to begin the summarization, but I will need to be more granular. I need rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities, and summarizing in batches may not yield optimal results.

💭 Thinking:
  Okay, here's my thought process laid out, expert-to-expert:

**My Approach to Dissecting This Material**

Right, so I see a request to produce a thorough summary, and my immediate instinct is to break it down. Attempting to synthesize the entire thing at once is just inefficient. The first thing I'll do is spawn a few sub-agents; think of them as specialized components. I'm going to start by breaking the document into logical sections.

Firstly, I'll direct an agent to focus solely on the "Front Matter" – the reviews, author information, acknowledgements, all that introductory material. It's important context, but not the core substance of the work. The goal is a concise overview of what sets the stage for the book and what others think of the book. I'll ask the agent to specifically extract the key themes and perspectives.

Next, I'll delegate the bulk of the content – the chapters – into three blocks: Chapters 1-4, Chapters 5-8, and Chapters 9-12. Each agent will be tasked with providing a concise yet complete synopsis of its assigned chapters. They need to extract the core arguments, methodologies, and findings from each section. I'm going to prioritize substance over structure. They'll need to summarize the essence of each chapter, the 'so what?' of each.

Finally, I'll assign the last agent to handle the "End Matter." This will include any concluding chapters, plus other concluding content, like any vision of the future that the book presents. I expect to pull out the key takeaways and any final thoughts or projections from the author.

The goal is a stratified summary. Each agent will focus on its portion, and then I will synthesize those summaries to create an overall summary.

    *   **Core Concept:** Competing brands sell to the same sort of people. Contrary to marketing ideology, brands do not have unique customer bases defined by demographics or psychographics.
    *   **The "Ford vs. Chevrolet" Study:** In 1959, personality tests showed that Ford and Chevrolet owners were essentiall...

Based on Chapters 9 through 12 of Byron Sharp's *How Brands Grow*, here are the detailed summaries:

### 1. Chapter 9: How Advertising Really Works
Advertising functions primarily by building and refreshing **mental availability**, rather than through rational persuasion or "teaching" consumers. 

*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   **Memory Structures**: Advertising creates and maintains memory links (nodes) that make a brand more likely to be retrieved in a buying situation.
    *   **Reach vs. Freq...

Below are the summaries for the final sections of *How Brands Grow* by Byron Sharp, detailing the core concepts and entities discussed.

1. **A Fine Future for Marketing (Page 200)**
   *   **Custodianship of Assets:** Marketing departments must evolve into custodians of two critical market-based assets: **Mental Availability** (the probability that a buyer will notice, recognize, and think of a brand in buying situations) and **Physical Availability** (making a brand as easy to find and buy as ...

💭 Thinking:
  Okay, here's my thought process as I synthesize these summaries and construct the `global_map.json` file.

**Compiling the Final Map**

Alright, I've got all the individual summaries compiled – now it's time to build the final `global_map.json`. I need to bring all the pieces together.

Hold on a second… I'm remembering that I also need to include those Front Matter summaries. I need to make sure I grab those and integrate them. Let me check the output of that initial task that was supposed to generate them.

Hmm, the output is empty! That's not right. Either I made a coding error somewhere, or the task didn't return properly. Either way, that's a problem.

Ah, I see it now. I'll need to re-run that first task specifically for the Front Matter. I need to make sure I don't miss those critical pieces of information. It's time to get this right and on the road to building the complete map!

💭 Thinking:
  **Constructing the Global Map JSON**

Okay, I'm ready. I have everything I need to build the `global_map.json` file. Let's make sure I'm following the correct structure: array of nodes, each with `title`, `level`, `start_page_id`, `end_page_id`, `start_line_index`, `summary_context`, and `children`.

Before I dive in, I need to double-check for child sections within the chapters. I saw those `##` and `###` headers in my `line_search` results, and I need to determine if they're significant enough to include. However, considering the prompt's focus on mapping the entire document, from the first chapter to the Index/Glossary, and capturing core concepts, main arguments, and key entities, I should keep the structure reasonably simple.

For a global map like this, it makes sense to use Level 1 for chapters and major front/back matter sections, with Level 2 for significant sub-sections if they're explicitly mentioned or are very important. The schema doesn't show a parent section like "Front Matter", so I will make each section a level 1 node.

Now, the prompt specifically states to trust the Table of Contents (ToC) for parent/child relationships. I didn't find a formal ToC, so I'm using the headers I found, mainly the `#` headers. I need to make sure I am not inventing any levels that don't exist. The prompt also tells me to trust the verified file content for `start_page_id`.

I need to make sure I haven't missed any major sections: "Reviews", "Author", "Contributors", "Preface", "The most important knowledge", "Examples", "Acknowledgements", "Special thanks", "E-book version", and chapters 1-14. Ah, and "A fine future for marketing" - that's also a `#` header, and I'll treat it as a level 1 section.

And now the `end_page_id`. I'll set it to the page before the next section begins, unless they share a page, then I will make the `end_page_id` the current page.

Okay, let's get this done.

  **My Global Map Creation Journey**

Alright, I've got the `global_map.json` file locked and loaded. That was a satisfying process. Thinking back, I had a pretty clear cognitive workflow to tackle this. First, the **RECONNAISSANCE** phase - I dove in, really explored the document. No formal Table of Contents, huh? No problem. I used `grep` to zero in on those chapter headers, building a mental picture of the structure. Then came **TARGET ACQUISITION**. I systematically verified the precise location of all the key sections and chapters. `line_search` was a lifesaver there, confirming everything was in the right place. Next, the **CONTEXTUALIZATION** step was where things really came alive. Leveraging those specialized subagents, I generated rich, concept-driven summaries for each section. I made sure to capture the key entities, the important frameworks - the essence of each part. Finally, the **ARTIFACT GENERATION** – I wrote the fully formed JSON structure to `/global_map.json`. It's done, I'm happy with how it came out. Time to wrap this up!

  Okay, here's my understanding, tailored for an expert audience like you.

**Ready to Deliver: Document Structure Confirmed**

Alright, I've got a solid grasp on this document. I've finished processing everything, and the `global_map.json` file is locked down and saved. It's got the full architectural blueprint of the text.

Here's the structural breakdown as I see it: We've got the usual *Front Matter* – reviews, the author's bio, a contributors section, a preface, some key knowledge highlights, examples, acknowledgments, and an ebook updates section, typical fare.

Then comes the meat of it – Chapters 1 through 14. This is where the core marketing science content resides. We're talking everything from Double Jeopardy and Acquisition vs. Retention to Mental and Physical Availability and the Dirichlet Model. That's the heavy lifting.

Finally, we close it out with a forward-looking *Closing* section – a vision for where marketing is headed, alongside a comprehensive FAQs section.

I've got all the pieces, and I'm prepped to engage with whatever the user needs now. Let's get to it.
