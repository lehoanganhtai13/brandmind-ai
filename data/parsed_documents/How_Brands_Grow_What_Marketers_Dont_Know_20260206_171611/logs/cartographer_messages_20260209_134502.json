        "thinking": "**My Approach to Markdown Document Analysis**\n\nOkay, so the task is clear: I need to generate a `global_map.json` file reflecting the structure and content of the markdown files in this directory. I've been asked to approach this systematically, which is always the best way to tackle a complex data task. My initial thought is, this sounds like a great problem for a multi-pass approach. I think of it as a methodical hunt – a scout, a hunter, an analyst, and finally, a scribe.\n\nFirst, I'll dive into *Reconnaissance*. I need to quickly establish the lay of the land. The key here will be identifying and understanding the Table of Contents within these markdown files. That'll be my starting point to infer structure. This phase is crucial; if I don't grasp the basic document hierarchy, the rest is just noise.\n\nNext, I will *Target Acquire*, meaning I must precisely locate each section within those documents and get the line numbers. I can't rely on formatting alone – I need exact positions for this to work correctly.\n\nThen comes *High-Density Contextualization*. This is the core intellectual work. I'll need to generate a nuanced summary for each section, focusing on key concepts and entities. This isn't just about a keyword search; it's about semantic understanding and relation identification. This is where the real value lies, turning raw information into insights.\n\nFinally, the *Artifact Generation* phase. Time to be the Scribe. Once I have the fully analyzed and contextualized information, I will write the final `global_map.json` file. It's the culmination of everything I've done thus far. I'm going to start by exploring the file system. Let's see what's in there.\n\n\n"

My first instinct, as always, is to navigate the structure. Forget brute-force reading – that's inefficient. I need a jumping-off point. Given the naming convention, a Table of Contents is the most likely candidate for providing that. I'll scan the initial files, maybe the first three or four, looking for any sign of a `[[TOC]]`, a well-formed markdown table, or a structured heading indicating a listing of contents. If I find something, I can quickly map the file organization, probably utilizing a simple Python script to parse the files and establish relationships between documents. It's all about finding that central point of reference to build my understanding from.\n\n\n"

So is architecture: architects design masterpieces like the Taj Mahal and the Sydney Opera House, but architects use their creativity within a framework of physical laws. Architects must design buildings that will not collapse under their own weight or blow over in a breeze; they cannot choose to ignore the law of gravity, or hope their building is immune to the laws of physics.\n    14\t\n    15\tMarketers, even senior marketing academics, like to say that there can be no laws concerned with marketing. These people argue that consumers are far too individual and unpredictable. Research has shown this is utter nonsense. This ill-founded belief stops academics doing their job and searching for law-like patterns in buying behaviour and marketing effects. It also allows marketers to carry on with ‘anything goes’ marketing plans. Imagine if architects designed ‘anything goes’ plans – “Let’s build out of fairy-floss’, ‘Let’s add another 68 floors!”\n    16\t\n    17\tMarketers argue with each other about things that have nothing to do with the creativity of the discipline; about things that should be known for certain. It’s time for this to stop. This book reveals the predictable patterns in how buyers buy, and how sales grow – things all marketers should know, not argue about.\n    18\t\n    19\tThese patterns are valuable knowledge. It’s often thought that great marketing strategy is obvious – with hindsight everyone can see what you did and copy you. This might be true for new products or some advertising campaigns, but in reality marketing offers the ability to outperform competitors while they scratch their heads wondering why on earth you are doing so well. Unfortunately, marketers themselves often have no idea why one of their own campaigns worked and others did not. Their explanations as to what they got right or wrong are often wide of the mark because their assumptions (theories in their head) are wrong.\n    20\t\n    21\tThis book is for marketers who are willing to learn new things based on classical science, and to shake off the superstition (and unfounded speculation) that today passes for marketing theory.\n    22\t\n    23\tRead the assumptions in Table 1.\n    24\t\n    25\t**Table 1:** Marketing assumptions\n    26\t\n    27\tThis table presents a framework for evaluating strategic assumptions, categorizing them into three possible states: True, False, or Don't Know. The structure is a simple two-column format, with the first column listing various \"Strategic Assumptions\" and the second column providing a space to indicate the assessed truth value of each assumption. This implies a process of critical analysis where each underlying belief or premise of a strategy is systematically examined and validated or invalidated. The \"Don't Know\" option acknowledges that some assumptions may not be immediately verifiable, suggesting a need for further investigation or data collection. The overall purpose appears to be the rigorous assessment of the foundational elements of a strategic plan to ensure its viability and effectiveness. If you believe that most of these are true, you are operating under many false assumptions."

It emphasizes that differentiating a brand is a crucial marketing task, with loyalty metrics reflecting brand strength rather than its market size. The data suggests that customer retention is more cost-effective than customer acquisition, and price promotions are more effective at increasing market penetration than building customer loyalty. The competitive landscape is influenced by brand image positioning, and mass marketing is presented as no longer competitive. Furthermore, the table highlights the importance of understanding customer motivations, noting that buyers have specific reasons for choosing a brand and that consumers can be characterized as a distinctive group. Finally, it points to a common Pareto principle in customer behavior, where the heaviest 20% of customers contribute at least 80% of sales.\n    12\tThis book will give you the evidence. If it changes your mind it might revolutionise your marketing.\n    13\t\n    14\t**Table 2: Towards a new view of marketing priorities**\n    15\t\n    16\tThis table contrasts a \"Past World View\" with a \"New World View,\" suggesting a shift in marketing and communication strategies. The past view focused on \"Positioning\" and \"Differentiation,\" aiming for \"Message Comprehension\" through \"Unique Selling Propositions\" and \"Persuasion\" by engaging \"Rational involved viewers.\" The emphasis was on clearly defining a product's place and advantages. In contrast, the new view prioritizes \"Salience\" and \"Distinctiveness,\" aiming for \"Getting noticed, emotional response\" and fostering \"Relevant associations.\" This approach seeks to build and refresh \"memory structures\" through \"Reaching\" rather than solely \"Teaching,\" acknowledging that audiences are often \"Emotional distracted viewers.\" The structure is comparative, highlighting a transition from a rational, feature-driven approach to an emotional, attention-grabbing one.\n    17\t\n    18\t# The most important knowledge contained in this book\n    19\t\n    20\t*No marketing activity, including innovation, should be seen as a goal in itself, its goal is to hold on to or improve mental and physical availability.*\n    21\t\n    22\tDecades of research into how buyers buy and how brands compete has led to these surprising conclusions:\n    23\t\n    24\t1. Growth in market share comes by increasing popularity; that is, by gaining many more buyers (of all types), most of whom are light customers buying the brand only very occasionally.\n    25\t2.

Brands that are easier to buy – for more people, in more situations – have more market share. Innovation and differentiation (when they work) build market-based assets, which last after competitors copy the innovation.\n    12\t\n    13\tTherefore, marketers need to improve the branding of their product (i.e. it needs to look like them and only them) and to continuously reach large audiences of light buyers cost effectively. Marketers need to research what their distinctive brand assets are (colours, logos, tone, fonts, etc.); they need to use and protect these. Managers also need to research how buyers buy their brand, when they think of and notice it, and how it fits into their lives (and shopping). Marketers need to manage media and distribution in line with this knowledge.\n    14\t\n    15\tAdvertising works largely by refreshing, and occasionally building, memory structures (and less by convincing rational minds or winning emotional hearts). Marketers need to research these memory structures and ensure that their advertising refreshes these structures by consistently using the brand’s distinctive assets.\n    16\t\n    17\tIn short, there is a great deal to learn, and much to be discovered, about sophisticated mass marketing.\n    18\t\n    19\tTables 3, 4 and 5 summarise old and new aspects of marketing.\n    20\t\n    21\t**Table 3:** Consumer behaviour\n    22\t\n    23\tThis table outlines a shift in consumer behavior, moving from a \"Past World View\" to a \"New World View.\" In the past, the framework suggested that \"Attitude Drives Behavior,\" leading to distinct consumer types such as \"Brand Loyals,\" \"Brand Switchers,\" and \"Deeply Committed Buyers,\" all characterized by a degree of \"Involvement\" and a \"Rational Involved View\" of their choices. The \"New World View\" inverts this dynamic, proposing that \"Behavior Drives Attitude.\" This new perspective reclassifies consumers into categories like \"Loyal Switchers\" (appearing under both \"Brand Loyals\" and \"Brand Switchers\" from the past), \"Uncaring Cognitive Misers\" (formerly \"Deeply Committed Buyers\"), and \"Emotional Distracted Viewers\" (formerly \"Rational Involved Viewers\"). This shift is underpinned by the concept of \"Heuristics,\" suggesting a move towards simpler decision-making processes.\n    24\t\n    25\t**Table 4:** Brand performance\n    26\t\n    27\tThis table outlines a comparative shift in brand performance strategies, moving from a \"Past World View\" to a \"New World View.\" The core structure is comparative, highlighting contrasting approaches across several key areas. In the past, growth was primarily sought through targeting existing brand loyals, whereas the new approach emphasizes growth through penetration. Metrics were previously obscure and proprietary but are now expected to be predictable and transparent. The effectiveness of price promotions has been re-evaluated; they were once seen as a way to win new customers but are now understood to primarily reach existing loyal customers. Marketing strategies have evolved from target marketing to sophisticated mass marketing. Finally, the concept of differentiation has been refined to distinctiveness, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of how brands stand out in the market.\n    28\t\n    29\t**Table 5:** Advertising\n    30\t\n    31\tThis table outlines key components of advertising, structured around a \"New World\" perspective. It highlights the importance of \"Positioning\" and \"Message Comprehension\" in crafting effective advertising strategies. Central to this is the identification of \"Unique Selling Propositions\" which are described as \"Relevant.\" The persuasive aspect of advertising is characterized as \"Refreshing,\" suggesting a need for novelty and impact. Furthermore, advertising serves a \"Teaching\" function, implying an educational role in informing consumers. Finally, the deployment of advertising is characterized by \"Campaign Bursts,\" indicating a strategic approach to timing and frequency. The overall structure suggests a framework for modern advertising, emphasizing relevance, persuasion, education, and strategic execution.

Margaret, the Senior Category Manager for toothpaste, is standing at your office door and she is obviously distressed. She is waving a recently received report from your global market research supplier, and this is what it shows:[12]\n    19\t\n    20\t**Figure 1.1:** Toothpaste brands: US market shares (volume)\n    21\t\n    22\tThis data presents a comparative analysis of the volume percentage occupied by two toothpaste brands, Colgate and Crest. Crest accounts for a significantly larger volume percentage at 37%, while Colgate occupies 19%. The structure is a simple comparison, highlighting the relative market share or presence of these two brands based on volume.\n    23\t\n    24\t*Data source: Spaeth & Hess 1989.*\n    25\t\n    26\tThe market research shows that Procter & Gamble’s Crest brand of toothpaste has double the market share of Colgate in the US. However, this has long been known and is not the reason why Margaret is upset. It’s the next couple of graphs that have her worried (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3).\n    27\t\n    28\t**Figure 1.2:** Crest consumer base These charts decompose the sales volume of each rival brand according to the recent repeat-buying behaviour of their consumers."

In the first instance, \"One time buyers\" constitute 16% of the base, \"Loyals\" represent 38%, and \"Switchers\" make up the largest segment at 46%. A subsequent, potentially contrasting or updated, analysis shows \"One time buyers\" at 11%, \"Loyals\" at 21%, and \"Switchers\" at a significantly higher 68%. This structure highlights a comparative analysis of consumer segmentation within the Colgate customer base, emphasizing the relative proportions of each buyer type across two different data points or analyses.\n    12\t\n    13\tThe percentage of Colgate’s sales that came from loyal customers is almost half that of Crest’s loyals (‘loyals’ being people who bought the brand for the majority of their toothpaste purchasing during the analysis period). Colgate’s sales come much more from ‘switchers’ – people who bought Colgate at least once in the analysis period, although most of their buying was of other brands."

Figure 1.4 reports the percentage of switchers who agree with the statement: “This is my preferred brand”, (the switcher group is the interesting one, as we can safely assume that both Crest’s and Colgate’s loyals will report that their brand is their preferred one.) As you can see, Figure 1.4 shows that Crest switchers are substantially more likely to say that Crest is their preferred brand.\n    22\t\n    23\tThe survey’s second question asks customers about their perceptions of quality. Figure 1.5 reports the quality perceptions of the switchers in each customer base. Both Crest and Colgate buyers perceive both brands to be quality products – as they should, because these are both well researched and well-made products.\n    24\t\n    25\t**Figure 1.4:** Percentage of brand buyers who say “This is my preferred brand” **Figure 1.5:** Percentage of brand buyers who say “This is a quality product”"

All the global market research agencies claim to provide an exclusive service that can tell if your brand is heading up or down. Every strategy consultancy says that only it can take you on the path to profitable share growth. Econometric modellers say they can quantify precisely which marketing mix will deliver maximum growth. This is all nonsense. If growth were that easy then all marketing directors would be out of a job, or paid a pittance of their current salary. No one can guarantee growth.  \n    19\tThat said, this book does reveal a great deal about how brands grow. Marketing science has been chipping away at the problem for decades. There have already been some breakthroughs that every professional marketing person should know about.  \n    20\t"

The sportswear market has a plethora of similar competing brands (Reebok, Puma, New Balance and Coq Sportif)<sup>40</sup>; one explanation for this brand proliferation is that marketers have used advertising and packaging to fool buyers into adopting irrational preferences and loyalties. This explanation has been put forward by both opponents and advocates of advertising and branding. There are plenty of psychological studies that support this argument, but they also suggest advertising and packaging have a very weak psychological effect (even under laboratory conditions)."

The most typical programs provide consumers with points each time they make purchases. Gradually, after many purchases, these points add up and reach a level where they may be redeemed for rewards. This points system is an incentive for consumers to purchase a particular brand more frequently (i.e. increase their loyalty) in order to gain more rewards faster. Such loyalty programs might also discourage defection from the brand as, once customers have accumulated points, and if they enjoy and value the loyalty program, they should be less likely to defect to another brand. At least that’s how the logic goes.\n    18\t\n    19\tHuge sums of money have been invested in loyalty programs over the past decade, be everyone from airlines to coffee shops. Some marketers implemented these programs because it was fashionable to do so, or launched programs because they now had the technology to do so. However, most marketers were motivated by the hope that loyalty programs would improve loyalty. They anticipated great business results, with large increases in sales and profit. 75\n    20\t"

Everything else is secondary. Brands largely compete in terms of physical and mental (brand salience) availability. Even product innovation largely works, when it works, through enhancing mental availability and gaining further distribution. Building mental availability requires reach, distinctiveness (clear branding) and consistency. The brand is seen/noticed, recognised and recalled more often. Building physical availability requires breadth and depth of distribution in space and in time. Together, mental and physical availability make a brand easier to buy for more people, in more situations.\n    18\t\n    19\t## A new theory of competition for sales\n    20\t"

While it is commonplace to talk about building strong brands (rather than short-run sales), brand managers have little specialist knowledge about building and managing these assets, and rarely if ever do they have comprehensive metrics covering mental and physical availability. Their efforts are seldom judged against such metrics. Considerable time is wasted on esoteric quackery concerned with segmentation, differentiation and how buyers perceive brands (e.g. brand personality).\n    14\t\n    15\tHowever, as more brand managers realise how brands really compete, their attention should turn towards activities that build mental and physical availability. Their attention will then shift to branding, media strategy and distribution – there is a great deal of research, development and experimentation that needs to be done in these areas to improve marketing effectiveness.\n    16\t\n    17\tMarketing today largely functions as a specialist part of the production department; it produces advertising and promotions rather than experimenting and learning about strategy. Development of specialist knowledge of these market-based assets should lead to greater respect for marketing as a crucial function of business. It is a significant opportunity because no other part of the organisation measures and therefore can claim to manage these intangible assets. The same cannot be said for other areas of a business, such as product development, customer service and pricing.\n    18\t\n    19\tThe future for marketing departments and for consumer brands is bright – if they adapt to the more complex and media-fragmented world we live in; if they become sophisticated mass marketers working with the empirical laws of marketing; and if they reject ‘anything goes’ lawless marketing strategy.\n    20\t\n    21\t# Chapter 13:  \n    22\t## The Scientific Laws\n    23\t\n    24\tByron Sharp One thing that emerges from the law-like patterns discussed in this book is that everything varies together."

I've got a clear table of contents, and I'm seeing it's broken down into chapters with pretty intriguing titles. First off, I see the following chapters: Chapter 1 is about **Evidence-based Marketing** (page 11). Chapter 2 seems to be diving into **How Do Brands Grow?** (page 25). Then we have **How To Grow Your Customer Base** (page 39) in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 then looks to delve into **Which Customers Matter Most?** (page 47). Chapter 5 shifts gears to **Our Buyers Are Different** (page 63). I wonder how this differs from Chapter 4? Following up with **Who Do You Really Compete With?** (page 77) in Chapter 6 seems like an interesting direction to take. Chapter 7 focuses on **Passionate Customer Commitment** (page 89) and then Chapter 8 looks like it may get into the weeds of marketing with **Differentiation Versus Distinctiveness** (page 111). Chapter 9 promises to uncover **How Advertising Really Works** (page 130), a perennial question, and Chapter 10 tackles **What Price Promotions Really Do** (page 147). Following up with Chapter 11, it looks like **Why Loyalty Programs Don’t Work** (page 162), which is always a juicy topic and Chapter 12: **Mental and Physical Availability** (page 169) - seems like an insightful exploration of accessibility. Chapter 13 gets to the underlying principles with **The Scientific Laws** (page 200) and finally Chapter 14 - **Frequently Asked Questions** (page 204).\n\nBefore getting into the meat of the content, I also see a few preliminary sections: First, is the **Author (Byron Sharp)** (page 4) - I need to double-check that page order later as it looks like the **Preface** is on page 6. It starts with the **Contributors** (page 5), followed by the **Acknowledgements** (page 9) and **Special Thanks** (page 10), and the **E-book Version** (page 10). I'll have to see if there is an **Index** or a **Bibliography** at the end. Total page count, I'm seeing is 208. It feels like a solid foundation, and I'm eager to dive in.\n\n\n"

My first advice is to follow the guidelines in this book closely, it’s risky enough launching a new brand there is isn’t the luxury of ‘breaking the rules’. There will be certain memory structures that have to be planted in consumers’ heads or they simply won’t notice the brand, don’t forget these in your efforts to tell people how wonderful your new brand is – stick to the fundamentals. See rule 4 in chapter 12.\n    14\t\n    15\tA brand with no distinctive assets has to build some. One shortcut is to work with what already exists in people’s heads, that is, borrow memory structures where you can.\n    16\t\n    17\t# Should a brand seek to build mental or physical availability first?\n    18\t\n    19\tBoth work together, physical availability is of little value if consumers don’t notice the brand, and advertising is of little value if the brand is physically difficult to obtain. This is one advantage of big brands, their advertising works better because of their wide physical availability, and their physical availability is supported by efficient mass media.\n    20\t\n    21\tOne tactic for new brands is to grow gradually one geographical area at a time. If you can buy media to match your geographical availability then a small advertising budget can be put to use to buy large share-of-voice in that restrictive geographical region.\n    22\t\n    23\t# Hasn’t the internet and new media changed everything?\n    24\t\n    25\tThe digital revolution is certainly exciting, offering new ways of reaching consumers, new ways of building mental and physical availability, and new data on buying behaviour. However, there is mounting evidence that changes in consumer behaviour have been far more modest than ‘experts’ predicted. All the talk of ‘frictionless commerce’, perfect information, the death of brands has turned out to be as good as predictions of flying cars.\n    26\t\n    27\tTen years ago we told our Ehrenberg-Bass Institute sponsors that predictions of the death of TV were ridiculous, as we showed predictable patterns of TV viewing (scientific laws) that had held through massive social and technological change, and continued to hold."

Resist customising your advertising unless you can see clear return for low cost – for example, global brands usually translate their ads into different languages.\n    12\t\n    13\t# Isn’t it expensive to try to reach light buyers?\n    14\t\n    15\tThis is a myth that holds marketers back.\n    16\t\n    17\tReaching millions of light buyers was the same challenge that faced marketers in the 20th Century and thanks to the emergence of mass media and national retail chains they were able to build brands, even global brands. Mass media and retail chains still exist, and are becoming increasingly global. They offer marketers great efficiency. In developed countries it still costs only around 2 cents to reach a person with a 30 second video using TV, in many countries it is far cheaper than this even. Today in the 21st Century we are in the golden age of mass media and mass distribution, and marketer who realise and exploit this will do very well.\n    18\t\n    19\t# Our commercials always features women, but we know that men make up a large chunk of our buyer base - should we change our advertising?\n    20\t\n    21\tIt’s important to distinguish between your targeting (you certainly have to reach and appeal to men) and your distinctive brand image – which may depend on using women in your advertising. But don’t assume, research your distinctive assets, check if the women in your advertising are an important part of your branding or not, and check if you are reaching and resonating with men or not.\n    22\t\n    23\t# Market partitions are just another name for segments aren’t they?\n    24\t\n    25\tNo, partitions are groups of brands that compete more directly with each other, and less directly with other brands in the category. Partitions may relate to different types of people (segments), for example sweeter breakfast cereals sell more to households with children, but such links may not always be obvious or of any practical consequence.\n    26\t\n    27\tIt’s important to remember that partitioning, while common, is usually slight. That’s why we call them partitions, not separate markets. They often require no marketing reaction, for example just because there is a partition does not mean you need to have a separate SKU or brand to service it, your existing brand may already compete very well in that partition as well as the rest of the market."

Well, no brand has an absolute penetration metric, it depends on the time period. Brands with 70% or more penetration **in a year** will have vastly lower penetration in a quarter or month. Underpinning such metrics is the same NBD distribution seen in chapter X. All brands, even a huge brand like Facebook has mostly very light users, and plenty of non users (especially in a quarter or a month). So, again, reach is essential.\n    14\t\n    15\t# Is everyone who buys the category in our target market?\n    16\t\n    17\tEssentially yes. With due consideration of your current physical availability, if you aren’t available in the North of the country then category buyers who live in the North fall, somewhat, outside of your target.\n    18\t\n    19\t# So if we have multiple brands or SKUs in the same category then they have the same target market?\n    20\t\n    21\tYes, which makes life much more simple, and can potentially save a great deal of money in not needing to undertake market research looking for differences. There is nothing wrong with your brands targeting identical markets - see “Implications for brand portfolio management” in chapter 6.\n    22\t\n    23\t# How can we make interesting, distinctive advertising if our target is everyone?\n    24\t\n    25\tBy employing a capable advertising agency. This is what great advertising does, it resonates with a broad cross section of people, it taps into our commonality as human beings. Disney is a fabulous example of this, it has crafted stories that appeal to people of different age, culture, race, religion and so on.\n    26\t\n    27\tResist the urge to admit defeat and retreat to concentrate on small winnable battles (e.g."

Essentially, these two strategies are similar and not attractive. Everyday brand managers are trying to reduce costs and improve quality to stay competitive – usually that’s about as far as you want to go with this strategy.\n    12\t\n    13\tThe other way to grow a brand is to invest in market-based assets – to improve the brand’s mental and physical availability. However, simply spending more on advertising will have similar results to the strategy above; it will cut your profits and there may be little to show for it afterwards. The trick is to make an investment that builds the brand’s assets, so that in future the marketing budget gets a greater return. That means better advertising and marketing. Building a distinctive memory structure achieves this; it enhances all future advertising (remember it is much easier to refresh existing memories, so advertising for brands that have distinctive elements embedded in people’s minds suffers less from brand ambiguity). Obtaining new physical distribution has a very similar effect; again advertising and other marketing efforts work better if a brand is more widely available.\n    14\t\n    15\tThe third option to stimulate a brand’s growth is to innovate and bring new or improved, desirable features to the marketplace. However, such advantages seldom last long, so it is important to ‘make hay while the sun shines’ and work fast to use the advantage to build penetration and enhance the brand’s market-based assets. New or improved features are something to talk about; they attract attention and generate publicity. Unfortunately, a lot of ‘innovation’ is not exciting or newsworthy.\n    16\t\n    17\tThere is no magic key to growth. It’s difficult because the potential returns are great and all your competitors are trying to grow too (at your brand’s expense). But you are much more likely to succeed when it’s understood that the key objective is to build its market-based assets. The brand must be easier to buy for more people in more situations. Market penetration is a good proxy measure for these assets, and so worth monitoring as a key metric. It’s better than overall sales, because sales can be distorted by price promotions and other efforts that target your heavier, existing consumers.\n    18\t\n    19\tGrowth is possible – all the laws of marketing in this book support this – and it doesn’t just depend on new products. Better advertising, better branding, better media strategy, better in-store displays by following the seven rules presented above – these are all paths to growth."

I have the precise file and line numbers for the **Author** information, located at `page_4.md`, line 11. I also know where to find the **Contributors** information (`page_5.md`, line 11), the **Preface** (`page_6.md`, line 11), and what I consider the heart of the matter - **The most important knowledge contained in this book** at (`page_7.md`, line 18). I have identified the locations for **Examples in this book** (`page_9.md`, line 11) and the **Acknowledgements** (`page_9.md`, line 22). Plus, I know where to look for **Special thanks** (`page_10.md`, line 15) and details about the **E-book version** (`page_10.md`, line 23). Now that's handled.\n\nNext step: I need to nail down the precise coordinates for all the individual chapters. And while I'm at it, I'll make sure to get the location of \"Reviews of How Brands Grow\" (Page 3). It makes sense to build this index meticulously to allow for a comprehensive mapping of the work.\n\n\n"

I've also verified that there isn't any content beyond Chapter 14, and page 208 seems to be the final page, containing the FAQs.\n\nNow, it's time to update the todo list and move into Phase 3: Contextualization. My goal here is to generate summaries for each section. To save time and tokens, I will leverage the subagent for this task. The crucial question is whether to handle these sections individually or in batches. I've decided to parallelize the summarization process using the `task` tool, to increase efficiency.\n\nBefore I launch the subagents, I need to make sure the section information is perfectly accurate. I will now refine the list of sections, including their precise start and end pages, along with their corresponding line numbers, ensuring there are no errors in my coordinates.\n\nNow I am ready to begin the summarization, but I will need to be more granular. I need rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities, and summarizing in batches may not yield optimal results.\n\n\n"

Attempting to synthesize the entire thing at once is just inefficient. The first thing I'll do is spawn a few sub-agents; think of them as specialized components. I'm going to start by breaking the document into logical sections.\n\nFirstly, I'll direct an agent to focus solely on the \"Front Matter\" – the reviews, author information, acknowledgements, all that introductory material. It's important context, but not the core substance of the work. The goal is a concise overview of what sets the stage for the book and what others think of the book. I'll ask the agent to specifically extract the key themes and perspectives.\n\nNext, I'll delegate the bulk of the content – the chapters – into three blocks: Chapters 1-4, Chapters 5-8, and Chapters 9-12. Each agent will be tasked with providing a concise yet complete synopsis of its assigned chapters. They need to extract the core arguments, methodologies, and findings from each section. I'm going to prioritize substance over structure. They'll need to summarize the essence of each chapter, the 'so what?' of each.\n\nFinally, I'll assign the last agent to handle the \"End Matter.\" This will include any concluding chapters, plus other concluding content, like any vision of the future that the book presents. I expect to pull out the key takeaways and any final thoughts or projections from the author.\n\nThe goal is a stratified summary. Each agent will focus on its portion, and then I will synthesize those summaries to create an overall summary.\n\n\n"

    "content": "Based on the detailed reading of Chapters 1 through 4 of **'How Brands Grow'** by Byron Sharp, here are the summaries:\n\n### 1. Chapter 1: Evidence-based Marketing\n*   **Core Thesis:** Marketing should be treated as a science governed by empirical laws rather than a creative discipline based on myths, anecdotes, and untested assumptions. Sharp argues that many modern marketing \"insights\" are actually just reflections of a brand's market share.\n*   **Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Double Jeopardy:** A law-like pattern where smaller brands are punished twice: they have fewer buyers, and those buyers are slightly less loyal (both behaviorally and attitudinally).\n    *   **Scientific Revolution in Marketing:** The transition from \"bloodletting\" (myth-based practices) to \"germ theory\" (evidence-based practices).\n    *   **Differentiate or Die:** Sharp critiques the Kotlerian view that success is solely about unique positioning and premium pricing, noting that distinctiveness is more important than differentiation.\n*   **Significant Entities:** Byron Sharp, Margaret (Colgate Palmolive), Colgate vs. Crest (Procter & Gamble) case study, Spaeth & Hess, Scott Armstrong (Wharton School), Andrew Ehrenberg, and Gerald Goodhardt (Ehrenberg-Bass Institute).\n*   **Summary:** The chapter introduces the \"Colgate Case,\" where a manager worries about low loyalty metrics that are actually perfectly normal for a brand of its size. Sharp warns that marketers often waste resources on \"loyalty\" initiatives or unbranded advertising because they ignore scientific laws of buyer behavior.\n\n### 2. Chapter 2: How Do Brands Grow?\n*   **Core Thesis:** Brand growth is primarily driven by increasing **penetration** (the number of people who buy the brand) rather than increasing **loyalty** (how often they buy it).\n*   **Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Double Jeopardy Law:** Confirms that brands of different sizes differ greatly in penetration but only slightly in purchase frequency.\n    *   **Loyalty Stability:** Loyalty metrics for competing brands are remarkably similar. Sharp shows that even functionally different brands (like anti-dandruff shampoo) still follow the same patterns.\n    *   **Heavy Buyer Fallacy:** The mistaken belief that growth should come from making existing heavy buyers buy even more.\n    *   **Niche Brands:** Sharp argues that true \"niche\" brands (small brands with high loyalty) are extremely rare; most are simply small brands with distribution or \"mental availability\" deficits.\n*   **Significant Entities:** Persil, Ariel, Surf (UK Detergents), Head & Shoulders, Vosene (UK Shampoo), Suave, Pantene (US Shampoo), Arm & Hammer (Church & Dwight), Axe (Unilever), and the IPA Effectiveness Awards (Binet & Field analysis).\n*   **Summary:** Through various categories (from shampoo to ready-mix concrete), Sharp demonstrates that market share is won through acquisition. He dismisses \"swimming upstream\" (trying to increase frequency) in favor of \"swimming downstream\" (increasing penetration).\n\n### 3. Chapter 3: How To Grow Your Customer Base\n*   **Core Thesis:** Acquisition is the only reliable path to growth and even to brand maintenance. Retention-focused strategies are based on flawed mathematics and \"wishful fantasy.\"\n*   **Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Defection Law:** Customer defection rates follow the Double Jeopardy law—they are a function of market share. Large brands have lower defection *percentages* simply because they are more physically and mentally available.\n    *   **The 5% Myth:** Rebuts the Reichheld and Sasser claim that a 5% increase in retention can double profits, labeling it a \"thought experiment\" with no empirical basis.\n    *   **Acquisition-Driven Dynamics:** Research by Erica Riebe shows that growing brands excel in acquisition, while declining brands suffer from poor acquisition, not \"excessive\" defection.\n*   **Significant Entities:** Reichheld & Sasser (Harvard Business Review), Erica Riebe, Adelaide Bank vs. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Ford, Toyota, and Honda.\n*   **Summary:** Sharp explains that much of customer defection is \"non-controllable\" (e.g., customers moving house or no longer needing the category). Therefore, a brand must constantly acquire new customers just to stand still, making acquisition a non-optional strategy.\n\n### 4. Chapter 4: Which Customers Matter Most?\n*   **Core Thesis:** The \"light buyer\" is the most important customer for growth. Brands must adopt \"sophisticated mass marketing\" to reach all category buyers, especially those who only buy the brand once or twice a year.\n*   **Key Concepts:**\n    *   **NBD (Negative Binomial Distribution):** The mathematical distribution that describes purchase frequencies, showing that all brands are dominated by a \"long tail\" of light buyers.\n    *   **20:30:50 Law:** A more accurate version of the Pareto Principle for marketing, where the heaviest 20% of buyers typically account for only about 50% of sales (not 80%).\n    *   **Law of Buyer Moderation:** The phenomenon where heavy buyers tend to buy less in the future (regression to the mean), while light/non-buyers tend to buy more.\n    *   **Wobble:** Random variation in individual purchasing that makes targeting based on \"current value\" unreliable.\n*   **Significant Entities:** Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi (Kantar and Nielsen data), Phil Kotler (critique of his \"death of mass marketing\" view), and John Maynard Keynes.\n*   **Summary:** Sharp argues that since the average buyer of even a giant brand like Coca-Cola only buys it a few times a year, marketing must maximize **reach**. Targeting heavy buyers via loyalty programs is ineffective because those buyers are already \"captured,\" whereas the mass of light buyers represents the greatest volume potential."

    "content": "Here is a detailed summary of Chapters 5 to 8 from Byron Sharp's *How Brands Grow*, highlighting the core concepts and empirical findings:\n\n1.  **Chapter 5: Our Buyers Are Different**\n    *   **Core Concept:** Competing brands sell to the same sort of people. Contrary to marketing ideology, brands do not have unique customer bases defined by demographics or psychographics.\n    *   **The \"Ford vs. Chevrolet\" Study:** In 1959, personality tests showed that Ford and Chevrolet owners were essentially identical in profile. This finding has been repeatedly confirmed across hundreds of categories, from cigarettes to mortgages.\n    *   **\"My Mum\" Phenomenon:** Buyers have positive attitudes toward the brands they use, similar to how people feel about their own mothers. However, the users of Brand A have the same opinion of Brand A as users of Brand B have of Brand B.\n    *   **The Failure of Extreme Targeting:** Even when brands explicitly target a specific niche (e.g., Yorkie’s \"It’s not for girls!\" campaign), successful brands end up with a customer base that mirrors the category average (Yorkie has 50% female buyers).\n    *   **Implications:** Brands should target the whole market. Growth potential is vast because a competitor’s customers are just like yours and are \"up for grabs.\"\n\n2.  **Chapter 6: Who Do You Really Compete With?**\n    *   **Core Concept:** The **Duplication of Purchase Law** governs brand competition. Brands share customers with each other in direct proportion to their market share.\n    *   **The Law of Sharing:** All brands within a category share their customer base with other brands in line with the size of those other brands. Every brand shares a lot with big brands and a little with small brands.\n    *   **Market Partitions:** Markets are generally \"unpartitioned\" (one mass market). Clusters of brands that share more than expected (partitions) are rare and usually based on functional differences (e.g., premium price or sugar-free variants) rather than \"brand image.\"\n    *   **Critique of Segmentation:** Perceptual maps often exaggerate brand isolation. Even premium brands like Ben & Jerry’s share more customers with large mainstream brands (like Carte D’Or) than with other small premium brands.\n    *   **Strategy:** Marketers should think like \"sophisticated mass marketers,\" seeking broad reach across the entire category rather than trying to hem their brands into narrow niches.\n\n3.  **Chapter 7: Passionate Customer Commitment**\n    *   **Core Concept:** Loyalty is common but \"prosaic\" (habitual and passive) rather than \"passionate.\" Most buyers do not care deeply about the brands they buy.\n    *   **Divided Loyalty:** Loyalty is rarely exclusive; it is \"polygamous.\" Buyers have a personal repertoire of brands they buy. 100% loyalty is usually only found among very light category buyers.\n    *   **Natural Monopoly Law:** Larger brands have a \"monopoly\" on light, occasional buyers. To grow, a brand must recruit these light buyers rather than focusing on \"heavy users\" or \"fanatics.\"\n    *   **Debunking \"Brand Love\":** Concepts like \"Lovemarks\" or \"Brand Love\" lack empirical support. For example, Harley-Davidson and Apple show normal loyalty levels. Apple's slight advantage is due to switching costs (operating systems) rather than passion.\n    *   **Attitude Stability:** Individual attitudes are \"probabilistic\" and fickle. In surveys, only about 50% of people give the same answer about a brand when asked again later.\n    *   **Advocacy Myth:** New customers actually provide more word-of-mouth than long-term loyalists because the brand is \"news\" to them.\n\n4.  **Chapter 8: Differentiation Versus Distinctiveness**\n    *   **Core Concept:** Marketers should seek **meaningless distinctiveness** rather than **meaningful differentiation**. Brands grow by being easy to recognize, not by being \"different.\"\n    *   **Differentiation is Weak:** Only about 10% of brand users think their brand is \"different\" or \"unique.\" Even for highly \"differentiated\" brands like Apple, 77% of users do not perceive the brand as unique.\n    *   **Distinctiveness:** This refers to unique identifying characteristics (colors, logos, taglines, symbols) that help consumers notice and recognize a brand (e.g., Nike’s swoosh, McDonald’s golden arches).\n    *   **Distinctive Assets:** To be valuable, an asset must be **Famous** (widely associated with the brand) and **Unique** (associated only with that brand).\n    *   **Strategic Shift:** Instead of striving for \"Unique Selling Propositions\" (USPs), marketers should build \"Unique Identifying Characteristics.\" Consistency over decades is crucial to building these mental structures, making the brand easier for consumers to find and buy."

    "content": "Based on Chapters 9 through 12 of Byron Sharp's *How Brands Grow*, here are the detailed summaries:\n\n### 1. Chapter 9: How Advertising Really Works\nAdvertising functions primarily by building and refreshing **mental availability**, rather than through rational persuasion or \"teaching\" consumers. \n\n*   **Key Concepts**:\n    *   **Memory Structures**: Advertising creates and maintains memory links (nodes) that make a brand more likely to be retrieved in a buying situation.\n    *   **Reach vs. Frequency**: Sharp argues that **reach** (reaching all category buyers) is far more important than frequency (reaching the same buyers multiple times).\n    *   **Nudging Propensity**: Most advertising works by slightly increasing the purchase probability for light buyers. A shift from a 1-in-400 chance to a 2-in-400 chance is invisible to the consumer but doubles sales if it happens across the mass market.\n    *   **Wastage**: Over 80% of TV advertising is \"wasted\" because it is either not noticed or not correctly branded.\n    *   **Emotion over Rationality**: Emotions are used to bypass the brain's screening mechanisms and generate attention, not necessarily to create \"brand love.\"\n*   **Entities**: Georgiana and June (fictional lemonade makers), Coca-Cola (example of mental availability), John Philip Jones (advertising researcher), and various econometric models (Flaherty, Broadbent).\n\n### 2. Chapter 10: What Price Promotions Really Do\nPrice promotions create immediate sales spikes but fail to drive long-term growth because they do not change underlying brand propensities.\n\n*   **Key Concepts**:\n    *   **Price Elasticity**: The average price elasticity for promotions is around -2.5 (a 10% cut yields a 25% volume increase). However, this varies based on brand size; small brands have higher elasticities but less total volume gain.\n    *   **The \"Addiction\"**: Managers become addicted to promotions because they deliver immediate, visible results, even if they decimate contribution margins.\n    *   **Lack of New Buyers**: Data shows that promotions rarely attract new customers; they primarily reward existing loyalists who would have bought the brand anyway (the **Selection Effect**).\n    *   **Reference Price**: Frequent discounting lowers the consumer's internal reference price, making them resistant to paying \"full price\" later.\n    *   **Comparison with Advertising**: While advertising has high reach and a long-lasting effect on memory, promotions have low reach (only affecting those in-store that week) and no lasting effect.\n*   **Entities**: John Dawes, John Scriven, Kantar Worldpanel, and the \"Reference Price Effect\" (Kahneman & Tversky's loss aversion).\n\n### 3. Chapter 11: Why Loyalty Programs Don’t Work\nLoyalty programs are generally ineffective at driving growth because they ignore the **Double Jeopardy** law and target the wrong audience.\n\n*   **Key Concepts**:\n    *   **Skewed Recruitment**: Loyalty programs naturally attract a brand’s heaviest, most loyal buyers (who have the most to gain) rather than the light or non-buyers needed for growth.\n    *   **Retention Fallacy**: The assumption that \"retaining\" customers is cheaper than \"acquiring\" them is flawed because all brands lose customers at rates proportional to their market share.\n    *   **FlyBuys Study**: A large-scale analysis of the FlyBuys program in Australia/NZ showed that while there is a tiny loyalty effect, it is often swamped by other marketing factors and fails to drive brand penetration.\n    *   **Regression to the Mean**: Apparent increases in loyalty among program members are often just natural fluctuations in buying behavior (the Law of Buyer Moderation).\n*   **Entities**: FlyBuys (Australia/NZ), Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, Lars Meyer-Waarden (Behavior Scan panel in France), and various supermarket/retail categories.\n\n### 4. Chapter 12: Mental and Physical Availability\nThe central thesis of the book is that brands compete primarily on **Availability**—making the brand easy to buy in the mind and in the store.\n\n*   **Key Concepts**:\n    *   **Mental Availability (Salience)**: The propensity for a brand to be noticed or thought of in a buying situation. It depends on the quantity and quality of memory links (e.g., color, logo, usage occasions).\n    *   **Physical Availability**: Making the brand as easy to find and buy as possible across space and time (distribution breadth and depth).\n    *   **Distinctive Assets**: Logos, colors, fonts, and characters (e.g., McDonald's Golden Arches, Coca-Cola Red) are critical because they act as \"coat-hangers\" for memories and help consumers bypass screening.\n    *   **Satisficing**: Consumers are \"cognitive misers\" who use heuristics (mental shortcuts) to choose \"good enough\" brands rather than evaluating every option.\n    *   **The Seven Rules for Marketing**:\n        1. Reach all buyers.\n        2. Be easy to buy.\n        3. Get noticed.\n        4. Refresh memory structures.\n        5. Create distinctive assets.\n        6. Be consistent but fresh.\n        7. Stay competitive (don't give a reason *not* to buy).\n*   **Entities**: Kotler (the \"Past World View\" of differentiation), McDonald’s (recovery through McCafe/salads), Apple iPhone/iPod (example of simplicity and distinctive assets), and Seppelt’s ‘Queen Adelaide’ winery."

    "content": "Below are the summaries for the final sections of *How Brands Grow* by Byron Sharp, detailing the core concepts and entities discussed.\n\n1. **A Fine Future for Marketing (Page 200)**\n   *   **Custodianship of Assets:** Marketing departments must evolve into custodians of two critical market-based assets: **Mental Availability** (the probability that a buyer will notice, recognize, and think of a brand in buying situations) and **Physical Availability** (making a brand as easy to find and buy as possible across time and space).\n   *   **Rejection of \"Quackery\":** The section criticizes the current focus on \"esoteric quackery\" such as complex segmentation, differentiation, and brand personality, which often lack empirical backing.\n   *   **Strategic Transformation:** Marketing is currently often treated as a \"production department\" for advertising. To gain respect as a crucial business function, it must shift toward strategic experimentation and the measurement of intangible assets that other departments (like pricing or customer service) cannot manage.\n   *   **Sophisticated Mass Marketing:** The future for brands is bright if they embrace **sophisticated mass marketing**, work with **empirical laws**, and adapt to a fragmented media landscape rather than pursuing \"lawless\" strategies.\n\n2. **Chapter 13: The Scientific Laws (Pages 200–203)**\n   *   **The Dirichlet Model:** The chapter highlights the **NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice** (developed by **Goodhardt**, **Ehrenberg**, and **Chatfield**) as one of marketing's greatest achievements. It is a mathematical model that assumes buying behavior is heterogeneous and probabilistic, predicting most of the patterns seen in real-world markets.\n   *   **Popularity as a Metric:** All brand metrics essentially reflect a brand’s **popularity**. When market share increases, penetration and loyalty metrics move in tandem, contradicting older theories of market behavior.\n   *   **Key Empirical Laws:**\n       *   **Double Jeopardy Law:** Small brands have far fewer buyers, and these buyers are slightly less loyal.\n       *   **Retention Double Jeopardy:** All brands lose customers in proportion to their market share; growth depends on gaining more than you lose.\n       *   **Pareto Law (60/20):** Contrary to the 80/20 myth, the top 20% of customers typically account for about 60% of sales, making the \"bottom 80%\" (light buyers) vital for growth.\n       *   **Law of Buyer Moderation:** Heavy buyers tend to buy less in future periods, while light/non-buyers buy more, a phenomenon known as **regression to the mean**.\n       *   **Duplication of Purchase Law:** Brands share their customer base with rivals in proportion to the rivals' market share.\n       *   **Physical Availability:** A \"weighted physical distribution\" of 80% or more is a necessary prerequisite for high market share, though not a guarantee of it.\n\n3. **Chapter 14: Frequently Asked Questions (Pages 204–208)**\n   *   **Loyalty and Growth:** Loyalty is a natural behavior, but it is bound by laws. Growth is achieved by increasing **penetration** (reaching more buyers) rather than trying to substantially increase the loyalty of existing heavy users.\n   *   **The Reach Imperative:** Even for giant brands like **Coca-Cola** or **Facebook**, reach is essential because their customer bases are dominated by light users. The target market for a brand is effectively everyone who buys in the category.\n   *   **Broad Appeal Advertising:** Effective advertising should avoid narrow segments and instead tap into \"commonality as human beings,\" citing **Disney** as a prime example of a brand that resonates across cultures, ages, and religions.\n   *   **Efficiency of Mass Media:** Reaching millions of light buyers through mass media (like **TV**) remains highly efficient and cost-effective (averaging around 2 cents per person for a 30-second spot in developed countries).\n   *   **The Digital Revolution Myth:** While the internet provides new data, the predicted \"death of brands\" or \"death of TV\" has not occurred. TV viewing has remained stable or increased, and consumer behavior has changed far less than many \"experts\" predicted.\n   *   **Budgeting for Continuity:** To maintain a consistent presence, advertising budgets should be spread evenly over time (roughly 1/12th per month) to maximize reach and ensure the brand stays \"top of mind\" throughout the year."

    "content": "Here are the detailed summaries of the front matter sections from 'How Brands Grow' by Byron Sharp:\n\n1.  **Reviews of How Brands Grow (page_3.md)**\n    This section features endorsements from prominent industry publications and high-level executives. Key entities include **CHOICE**, **Marketing Week (UK)**, **Joseph Tripodi** (**The Coca-Cola Company**), **Mitch Barns** (**The Nielsen Company**), **Bruce McColl** (**Mars Inc.**), and **Thomas Bayne** (**MountainView Learning**). The reviews praise the book’s \"groundbreaking ideas\" and its scientific rigor in explaining the \"**Laws of Growth**.\" They highlight Sharp’s critique of the \"cult of differentiation\" and his characterization of consumers as \"uncaring cognitive misers,\" noting that the book provides a competitive advantage by replacing marketing \"psycho-babble\" and myths with evidence-based insights.\n\n2.  **Author: Byron Sharp (page_4.md)**\n    **Byron Sharp** is a Professor of Marketing Science and the Director of the **Ehrenberg-Bass Institute** at the **University of South Australia**. His research is supported by global giants like **Coca-Cola**, **Colgate-Palmolive**, **Procter & Gamble**, and **Unilever**. A prolific academic, Sharp has published over 100 papers and co-hosted conferences at the **Wharton Business School** with **Professor Jerry Wind**. He has co-edited special issues of the ***Journal of Advertising Research*** on the scientific laws of advertising and is the author of the textbook \"***Marketing: theory, evidence, practice***\" (Oxford University Press).\n\n3.  **Contributors: John Dawes, Jenni Romaniuk, John Scriven (page_5.md)**\n    The book features contributions from several distinguished academics at the **Ehrenberg-Bass Institute**:\n    *   **John Dawes**: An Associate Professor and editor of the ***Journal of Empirical Generalisations in Marketing Science*** (**EMPGENS**), with extensive experience in sales and marketing.\n    *   **Jenni Romaniuk**: A Research Professor and Associate Director (International) whose expertise includes **brand equity**, **brand image tracking**, and the link between **brand perception and behavior**. She is also the executive editor of the ***Journal of Advertising Research***.\n    *   **John Scriven**: Formerly the director of the **Ehrenberg Centre** at **London South Bank University**, he specializes in **brand performance measures** and the effects of price and advertising, drawing on decades of experience with corporations like **Pepsico** and **United Biscuits**.\n\n4.  **Preface (page_6.md)**\n    Sharp compares marketing to architecture, asserting that just as architects must follow the laws of physics, marketers must operate within a framework of **scientific laws**. He dismisses the idea that consumers are too unpredictable for such laws to exist as \"utter nonsense.\" The preface argues that there are **predictable patterns** in buyer behavior and sales growth that should be treated as certainties. Sharp aims to replace marketing \"superstition\" with knowledge based on **classical science**, introducing **Table 1** to challenge common (and often false) strategic assumptions held by many marketers.\n\n5.  **The most important knowledge contained in this book (page_7.md to page_8.md)**\n    This core section outlines a paradigm shift from a \"Past World View\" to a \"New World View,\" focusing on **mental and physical availability** as the primary drivers of growth.\n    *   **Growth and Competition**: Market share grows by increasing **popularity (penetration)** among light buyers. Brands compete as \"near lookalikes\" and should prioritize **distinctiveness** (being easily identified) over differentiation.\n    *   **Consumer Behavior**: The book posits that **behavior drives attitude** and that consumers use **heuristics** rather than rational involvement.\n    *   **Advertising**: Instead of rational persuasion, advertising works by **refreshing memory structures** and building relevant associations through the consistent use of **distinctive brand assets** (logos, colors, etc.).\n    *   **Strategy**: The focus shifts from \"Target Marketing\" to \"**Sophisticated Mass Marketing**\" and from \"Positioning\" to \"**Salience**.\"\n\n6.  **Examples in this book (page_9.md)**\n    Sharp emphasizes the generalizability of his findings across diverse categories, including **industrial products**, **supermarket packaged goods**, and **national vs. retailer brands**. He uses international examples—such as **car retention in France** and **bank choice in Australia**—to show that these laws hold across different countries and decades. He acknowledges data contributions from **Nielsen** and **Kantar** that support these cross-country generalizations.\n\n7.  **Acknowledgements (page_9.md)**\n    The empirical laws presented are the result of years of research funded by various global corporations. Sharp thanks the long-term supporters of the **Ehrenberg-Bass Institute**, including **Coca-Cola**, **PepsiCo**, **General Motors**, the **Advertising Research Foundation**, the **Australian Research Council**, **ANZ Bank**, **Commonwealth Bank of Australia**, **Roy Morgan Research**, **Reckitt Benckiser**, and **SABMiller**.\n\n8.  **Special thanks (page_10.md)**\n    Sharp offers personal thanks to his family (**Anne** and **Lilith**) and his colleagues at the Institute. He specifically recognizes **Professor Jerry Wind** (Wharton) for global collaboration and **Dr. Thomas Bayne** (**Mountainview Learning**) for their joint efforts in training marketing executives in **behavioral science** and evidence-based practices.\n\n9.  **E-book version (page_10.md)**\n    The updated version of the book includes hundreds of refinements and new content on **category growth**, **industrial buying**, and a new law regarding **physical availability**. It also features a **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** chapter, an expanded bibliography, and new data tables—such as those analyzing **Apple’s brand loyalty**—to demonstrate the continued relevance of the book's scientific principles."

        "thinking": "**Constructing the Global Map JSON**\n\nOkay, I'm ready. I have everything I need to build the `global_map.json` file. Let's make sure I'm following the correct structure: array of nodes, each with `title`, `level`, `start_page_id`, `end_page_id`, `start_line_index`, `summary_context`, and `children`.\n\nBefore I dive in, I need to double-check for child sections within the chapters. I saw those `##` and `###` headers in my `line_search` results, and I need to determine if they're significant enough to include. However, considering the prompt's focus on mapping the entire document, from the first chapter to the Index/Glossary, and capturing core concepts, main arguments, and key entities, I should keep the structure reasonably simple.\n\nFor a global map like this, it makes sense to use Level 1 for chapters and major front/back matter sections, with Level 2 for significant sub-sections if they're explicitly mentioned or are very important. The schema doesn't show a parent section like \"Front Matter\", so I will make each section a level 1 node.\n\nNow, the prompt specifically states to trust the Table of Contents (ToC) for parent/child relationships. I didn't find a formal ToC, so I'm using the headers I found, mainly the `#` headers. I need to make sure I am not inventing any levels that don't exist. The prompt also tells me to trust the verified file content for `start_page_id`.\n\nI need to make sure I haven't missed any major sections: \"Reviews\", \"Author\", \"Contributors\", \"Preface\", \"The most important knowledge\", \"Examples\", \"Acknowledgements\", \"Special thanks\", \"E-book version\", and chapters 1-14. Ah, and \"A fine future for marketing\" - that's also a `#` header, and I'll treat it as a level 1 section.\n\nAnd now the `end_page_id`. I'll set it to the page before the next section begins, unless they share a page, then I will make the `end_page_id` the current page.\n\nOkay, let's get this done.\n\n\n"

Thinking back, I had a pretty clear cognitive workflow to tackle this. First, the **RECONNAISSANCE** phase - I dove in, really explored the document. No formal Table of Contents, huh? No problem. I used `grep` to zero in on those chapter headers, building a mental picture of the structure. Then came **TARGET ACQUISITION**. I systematically verified the precise location of all the key sections and chapters. `line_search` was a lifesaver there, confirming everything was in the right place. Next, the **CONTEXTUALIZATION** step was where things really came alive. Leveraging those specialized subagents, I generated rich, concept-driven summaries for each section. I made sure to capture the key entities, the important frameworks - the essence of each part. Finally, the **ARTIFACT GENERATION** – I wrote the fully formed JSON structure to `/global_map.json`. It's done, I'm happy with how it came out. Time to wrap this up!\n\n\n"
