Not far away the tenth birthday of its launch is likely to coincide with the milestone of the billionth iPhone sold.

Marketing ‘gurus’, it seems, often completely misjudge what is, and is not, convenient and important to consumers. I recommend relying on empirical market research to understand what can make the brand easy to buy. Consider how poor so many web sites are, and how poorly laid out so many stores are. This clearly isn’t being given enough marketing attention.

### Rule 3: Get noticed

Reaching consumers with advertising and physical distribution amounts to little if the brand is not noticed. Brands that are not seen on the shelf (or not seen when gazing down the street or driving past a store) cannot be bought. Advertisements that are not noticed cannot affect memory structures.

Consumers regularly actively avoid advertising. They use new technologies to do so, as well as old techniques like leaving the room during the television commercial break or flicking past the full-page ad. But even more importantly, consumers don’t pay much attention to the advertising they are exposed to.

Little attention is not the same as not processing. We notice more than just the things we actively attend to. Otherwise how on earth could we be ever be prompted (e.g. distracted) to shift our attention? Our ‘supervisory attentioning system’ (du Plessis, 2005) adjusts our focus from one thing to another, but to do this our brain is processing more than just the object of our current attention.

Robert Heath (2001) has written a book on the fact that advertising can affect memory structures even if it is given very little attention. This is true, but it is still better to gain some attention. Heath argues quite well (although from limited data) that emotionally oriented advertising, in particular, can still work with low attention processing. Heath is on solid ground when he uses this to argue that measures of advertising recall are poor measures of advertising effect.

However, Erik du Plessis (2005) points out that one of the primary aims of emotional content in advertising is to gain attention. He draws on considerable empirical evidence showing the link between ad liking and ad awareness. Some years prior to meeting Erik, Dr Rachel Kennedy and I had been making the same argument: that the gentle, if complex, emotional reaction of liking increased the sales effectiveness of advertising , because it encouraged consumers to pay a little more attention.
