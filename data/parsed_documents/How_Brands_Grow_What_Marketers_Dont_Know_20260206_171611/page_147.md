# Chapter 10:  
## What Price Promotions Really Do

John Dawes & John Scriven

----

Price promotions have an immediate and positive effect on sales. But the effect does not last; it ends when the price discount ends. This is because price promotions largely reward customers who have bought the discounted brand in the past (and who are lucky enough to find it on sale). Price promotions do not alter underlying propensities to buy in the future; they lack reach and usually fail to bring new customers to a brand.

## Introduction

A book about the laws of marketing and buying behaviour would not be complete without discussing price. This chapter reveals the law-like patterns in how consumers react to price changes, particularly how temporary price discounts affect buying, sales and profits.

## Price is not all-important

Price is a powerful variable in the marketing mix. It is arguably the easiest element of a product to change and it has the largest direct effect on sales. Price obviously matters to consumers, and is often thought to be the most important factor. Yet, brand leaders are almost never the cheapest. Not all buyers switch when a more expensive brand becomes cheaper. Therefore, price is not everything. So how do consumers react to price and to price changes and why do they behave as they do?

This chapter principally comments on what happens when the price of an established brand is changed temporarily, for example, in a price promotion. We will not be discussing the process of setting a price. However, it is important to bear in mind that each brand has a ‘normal’ price that reflects the quality of the brand (with some variation for how much is available (supply) and mental & physical availability (demand).
