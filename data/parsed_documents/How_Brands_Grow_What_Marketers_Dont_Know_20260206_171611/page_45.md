# Is defection largely outside of marketer control?

A simple explanation for the pattern described above is that customer defection is largely outside of marketer control – at least in terms of being able to alter it with customer service and other such initiatives. There is some very good evidence to support this. Consider the following data (Table 3.3) on annual defection rates from financial institutions in Australia. This data shows a very typical double jeopardy pattern: loyalty declines with market share. In comparison to the huge variation in market shares (a thirtyfold difference between Adelaide Bank and CBA), defection rates vary little.

**Table 3.3:** Defection rates (Australian financial institutions)

This data presents a comparative analysis of several banks, detailing their market share and customer defection rates. The structure is a direct comparison of individual entities against two key metrics. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) exhibits the highest market share at 32%, with a relatively low defection rate of 3%. In contrast, Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and State Government Insurance Office (STG) show progressively lower market shares, ranging from 13% down to 6%, with defection rates between 4% and 5%. Smaller institutions like BankSA and Adelaide Bank have the lowest market shares at 1%, but notably higher defection rates of 5% and 7% respectively, indicating a potential inverse relationship between size and customer loyalty among the smaller players.

The smallest brand, Adelaide Bank, is a regional bank with branches essentially only in Adelaide. CBA, the largest bank by a considerable margin, is thoroughly national with branches in every main city and regional centre. If someone moves from Adelaide to Sydney (about 20% of Australians move house each year) and if they banked with Adelaide Bank they now find themselves a very long way from the nearest Adelaide Bank branch. Hence, they are likely to switch to another bank, one with branches convenient to their new Sydney home. But if they had previously banked with CBA in Adelaide, odds are that they will have Sydney branches that are just as convenient as ever.

These differences in physical distribution seem to almost entirely explain the double jeopardy pattern in bank defection rates. So Adelaide Bank’s comparatively high defection level (double CBA’s) is probably nothing to do with differences in customer satisfaction, brand equity, nor any indicator of CBA having a superior retention program. It’s simply that Adelaide Bank is smaller than CBA and has fewer branches, so it must have more defection. Therefore, Adelaide Bank should not worry about its higher defection rate; there is practically nothing that can be done about it unless Adelaide Bank dramatically increases its market share<sup>19</sup>.

Research examining the reasons for customer defection (Bogomolova & Romaniuk 2005, 2009; Lees, Garland & Wright 2007; Bogomolova 2010, East et al 2012) has shown that much defection occurs for reasons entirely beyond the firm’s control (e.g.
