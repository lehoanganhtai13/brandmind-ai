## Frequently Asked Questions

----

### So there is no such thing as loyalty?

Quite the opposite. Loyalty is natural behaviour, we see it in every product/service category. It’s just that there are scientific laws about a brand’s level of loyalty (in the same way as there are laws for gravity), and the double jeopardy law says that a brand’s loyalty metrics won’t rise unless it substantially increases its penetration (and thereby market share).

### Is nudging someone from one purchase to two increasing their loyalty?

Yes exactly. And someone moving from buying once a quarter to twice a quarter is the same, this means that they now add to the brand’s quarterly penetration every quarter, whereas before they did so only every second quarter.

When a brand successfully nudges the market’s buying propensity (their loyalty for the brand) it shows up as a large change in penetration and a small improvement in loyalty metrics because most people don’t buy very often.

Double Jeopardy tells us that loyalty marketing goals that assume large changes in a brand’s loyalty metrics are misguided. And that targeting existing heavier more loyal customers is not a good growth path.

### What about small brands?

The scientific laws apply to large and small brands, service brands, B2B brands and so on. I’ve used a range of examples to try to show this.

And I deliberately used Coca-Cola to illustrate the Negative Binominal Distribution (NBD) in chapter 4, because if that’s what the customer base of such a giant brand looks like then it’s not hard to see that small brands face the same sort of situation – most of their buyers buy very infrequently, and most people don’t buy them at all, so reach is essential.
