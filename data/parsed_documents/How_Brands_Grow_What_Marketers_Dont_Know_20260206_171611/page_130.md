# Chapter 9:  
## How Advertising Really Works

Byron Sharp

----

Once upon a time there were two little girls, Georgiana and June, who lived in a little French village. Their parents had a beautiful orchard with many lemon trees. So one day they decided to make lemonade. Over time they became very proficient lemonade makers. Each summer, during school vacation, they sold their lemonade to friends and neighbours.

The little girls grew up, got married and moved to the big city. They lived on opposite sides of the town and, sadly, they saw little of each other. However, they both continued to make and market lemonade.

Georgiana had married the owner of a newspaper (her sister June had married a lawyer) and one year she decided to place advertisements for her lemonade in her husband’s newspaper. They said “Georgiana’s lemonade: real lemony”. Nothing dramatic happened but Georgiana’s sales steadily grew – eventually she had to source additional supplies of lemons. In the following years, her sales continued to grow slowly, with occasional jumps when a new store started stocking Georgiana’s lemonade.

Meanwhile, the sales of June’s lemonade also grew for a while, then for a long time they were steady and then her sales started to decline slightly. One Christmas she discussed this with her sister Georgiana, and on her advice began to advertise. June’s advertisements featured the cunningly crafted message “June’s lemonade: lemon goodness”.

Today Georgiana’s brand is the largest with slightly more than 60% market share. It is stocked in more stores, it gets more publicity, has more buyers and more people say they prefer it. June’s lemonade also continues to sell well and make a profit. She has almost 40% relative market share and her sales decline has stopped. The percentage of June’s buyers who say it tastes great is similar to the percentage of buyer’s who like the taste of Georgiana’s lemonade.
