This sounds like a very tough task, yet, perversely, many marketers embrace the idea, perhaps because merely selling things sounds crass. Many marketing texts talk about creating value, delivering customer satisfaction and building relationships. This makes the marketing profession appear so much more honourable.

So it was a marketing masterstroke of Facebook to use the (ridiculously over-the-top) term ‘fan’ for any Facebook user who merely happened to once click the Like button on a post that came from the brand. Of course besotted marketers clamoured to build their Facebook ‘fan bases’.

This marketing orthodoxy means that it is derogatory to suggest to a brand manager that the loyalty his or her brand enjoys is due to habit, availability, and/or lack of caring on behalf of buyers. Academics have long derided such buying behaviour with pernicious terms such as ‘spurious loyalty’.<sup>46</sup> Marketing consultants and professors urge brand managers to build deep relationships with their buyers. While market researchers offer tools that guarantee to find (some) passionately loyal buyers.

Consumers can apparently even have deep attachments to cheap everyday consumer goods. In 1997 a highly respected academic journal included an article based on long (2-3.5 hours), paid interviews with eight coffee drinkers (see text box at the start of this section for a flavour of the article). The authors of the article proposed that consumers have deep and complex relationships with (coffee) brands – and somehow their research findings turned out perfectly in line with their prior beliefs.

If you think that is all just a bit silly you’ll be dismayed by the lead article in the March 2012 volume of our discipline’s top cited journal (the Journal of Marketing) titled “Brand Love”. Qualitative interviews were followed by a one-off cheap online survey of 268 US undergraduate college students at a single university. The students were asked to pick a consumer electronic brand they loved, and another they felt “mostly neutral, not love, about”, and were then asked 59 largely attitudinal questions about each. No surprise that the iPod was the most chosen brand, the authors didn’t mention the popularity of digital music with college students but instead attributed this love to the fact that it allowed personalising of music selection, and that “the iPod’s industral design (the simplicity of its click-wheel mechanism and menu navigation) is likely to promote a sense of natural and intuitive fit”. What this psycho-babble has to do with brand love is beyond me, and obviously beyond Apple too, as they have dropped the click wheel.
