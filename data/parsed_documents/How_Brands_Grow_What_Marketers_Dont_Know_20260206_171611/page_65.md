**Table 5.2:** Owners of different car brands hold similar values, UK 1990s

This data presents a comparative analysis of car owners' attitudes, specifically focusing on four distinct viewpoints: intolerance of untidiness, keeping up with technology, judging people by their car, and viewing a car solely as transportation. The percentages indicate the proportion of owners of specific car models (Rover, Escort, Sierra, Cavalier) who agree with each statement. Across all surveyed car models, there is a general trend: a higher percentage of owners express agreement with the idea that "A car is only to get from A to B" and "I cannot bear untidiness," with averages of 18% for both. Conversely, fewer owners agree with "I keep up with technology" (average 10%) and "I judge people by the car they drive" (average 2%). The data highlights variations in these attitudes across different car brands, suggesting potential correlations between vehicle ownership and personal philosophies.

Let’s see how this generalises to very different condition, beer brands in Canada (see Table 5.3). In spite of the differences in price, origin (from Mexico to Toronto) and brand images, these beer brands have the same customer profiles. Modelo and Corona skew a little bit towards women and younger drinkers, but that’s about the only substantive difference.

**Table 5.3:** Beer brands’ consumers

This table presents a comparative analysis of beer brand buyers across demographic categories, including gender, age group, and earnings. The data is structured to show the percentage distribution of Men and Women buyers for each brand, alongside the percentage of buyers within the "<29" and "50-59" age brackets, and the percentage of buyers earning less than "$30" and "$50" thousand. Brands like Coors, Canadian, Bud, Oland, Blue, Sleeman, Corona, Modelo, and Miller are individually profiled. An overall "Average" row synthesizes the data, indicating a general trend of male dominance in beer purchasing, a significant proportion of younger (<29) buyers, and a substantial segment of buyers earning below $50,000 annually. The structure facilitates a direct comparison of buyer demographics across different beer brands and highlights overall market tendencies.

Now let’s look at credit cards (see Table 5.4). These are in a product/service category where there can be substantial differences between products. These differences might appeal to particular market segments and not to others.

Again, the user profiles of the brands are very similar. Every credit card brand has a customer base that’s about half female and half male. Barclays MasterCard has a customer base that is 60% male compared to the average of 54%, but this is a small difference that has no practical marketing significance.
