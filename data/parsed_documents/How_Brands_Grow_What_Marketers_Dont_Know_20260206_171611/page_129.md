The value is that if a brand consistently uses blue in its packaging and communications, and it is the only brand that uses blue, consumers should quickly and easily identify that blue represents the brand. This will hopefully mean that colour can replace the brand in some circumstances, or extend the branding quality of any communication beyond simply mentioning or showing the brand name.

# Conclusion

Scientific laws, theory and direct empirical evidence challenge the importance placed on meaningful perceived differentiation. Differentiation *does* exist, but the degree of differentiation is weak and varies little between rival brands, and it is far less important than is portrayed. Brands within a category do not vary markedly in their degree of differentiation, perceived or otherwise. While Pizza Hut, McDonald’s and KFC sell different products (pizza, burgers and fried chicken, respectively) the reality is that they compete as fast food brands.

This finding has resulted in the presentation of an alternative strategic emphasis: marketing should build distinctive qualities that increase the visibility of the brand in its competitive environment price (i.e. branding matters). Distinctive assets make it easier for consumers to notice, recognise, recall and (importantly) buy the brand. An emphasis on distinctiveness means less of trying to find unique selling propositions and more trying to find unique identifying characteristics. Distinctive assets are not what motivate consumers to buy brands; it’s how they know where the brand is and what brand they bought. They allow for the development of loyalty.

The next three chapters present empirical evidence on how marketing interventions, like advertising and price promotions, work. Then we can return to this topic of how brands compete and what marketers must achieve in order to grow market share over the long term.
