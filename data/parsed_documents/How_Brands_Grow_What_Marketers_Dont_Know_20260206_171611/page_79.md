This empirical evidence counters Kotler’s idea that individual brands sell to distinctly different segments of buyers – brands share customers. Several of the brands are even marketed by the Coca-Cola company; these brands share their customers with Coca-Cola as much as rival company’s brands do.

Customer-sharing data gives insight into who competes against whom. If brands are close rivals, then they should be in the repertoires of the same people, that is, they share customers<sup>35</sup>. Logically, brands that are direct competitors within a product category should show higher levels of sharing, and brands that target different segments should share fewer customers.

# Duplication of purchase analysis

The extraordinary fact about the sharing analysis is not that Pepsi buyers also buy Coca-Cola (although this surprises some people), but that each brand shares a near identical proportion of its customer base with Coca-Cola.

The exact degree of sharing depends on the period of analysis. If it is long enough, then nearly all of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola, whereas over a very short time period a smaller proportion of a brand’s customers will have also bought Coca-Cola. However, the length of time affects all brands equally, so it doesn’t affect inter-brand comparisons. Irrespective of the time period, each brand of soft drink shares a similar proportion of its consumers with Coca-Cola.

This suggests that all the brands compete *equally closely* with Coca-Cola, and that none of them sell to special discrete segments of buyers. Perhaps this is because Coca-Cola is so large. Perhaps no soft drink brand can get away from competing with Coke. But how do brands compete with less ubiquitous brands? Let’s now expand the analysis to consider all brands in a category.

A ‘duplication of purchase’ table<sup>36</sup> shows the degree to which brands within a category share their buyers with each of the other brands in the category (i.e. what proportion of their customers also bought another particular brand during the period). Table 6.2 is a duplication of purchase table with no data.

**Table 6.2:** Duplication of purchase, a table without data

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on the percentage of buyers who also purchased other brands. The table is structured with brands A, B, C, and D listed along the rows and columns. The diagonal entries, representing the percentage of buyers who also bought the same brand, are all 100%. The off-diagonal entries are empty, implying no data is presented for buyers of one brand also purchasing another. This structure highlights a self-purchasing pattern for each brand individually, without indicating any cross-brand purchasing relationships or cannibalization effects. The overarching structure is comparative, examining each brand's purchasing behavior in isolation. The 100% cells are a brand’s level of customer overlap with itself, which logically must always be 100%.
