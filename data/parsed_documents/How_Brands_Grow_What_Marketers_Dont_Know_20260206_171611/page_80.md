In terms of the presentation of the data, it’s good practice to blank out these cells because they are not needed.

Duplication of purchase tables refer to a particular time period, for example, the people during the year who bought brand A who also bought brand B. Note that a buyer of brand A needs to only make one purchase of brand B to be counted. Consequently, duplication analyses that apply to very long periods can be misleading, because every brand may show very high levels of sharing with every other brand, which obscures who competes more or less closely. At the other end of the time spectrum, in very short time periods there is often no duplication (because many customers have only bought the category once), which is also misleading. The analyst should choose a period long enough to capture a degree of repeated purchase, that is, a period long enough to allow most people to have bought multiple brands. Readers of duplication tables need to note that they refer to a particular period, there is never an absolute metric; one can’t simply say, ‘70% of Pepsi buyers drink Coke’ – it’s 70% **in a year**.

# The duplication of purchase law

Let’s look at a duplication of purchase table for ice-cream brands (see Table 6.3).

**Table 6.3:** Duplication of purchase – ice-cream, 2005

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand perception among different buyer groups for premium ice cream brands. The table outlines the percentage of buyers for specific brands, including (Walls) Carte D’Or, Walls Dessert, Ben & Jerry’s, Häagen Dazs, Nestle, Walls, and Mars, as perceived by various buyer segments. Each row represents a buyer group, and the columns indicate the percentage of those buyers who associate with each listed brand. The structure is a matrix, allowing for direct comparison of how each buyer segment views the different brands. A final row provides the average percentage across all buyer groups for each brand, offering an overall view of brand recognition and association. The data highlights varying levels of brand penetration and perception across distinct consumer bases within the premium ice cream market. *Source: Kantar Worldpanel, UK.*
