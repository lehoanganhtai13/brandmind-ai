The brands that have dominated for decades have done so by being consistent, not by repositioning.

Too often this is forgotten, and the desire to present something new wins. Similarly, much advertising trips over itself trying to present persuasive, differentiating messages. Consumers are resistant to new ideas, yet they are very happy to be reminded of things they already believe, particularly if it is done in an entertaining way.

A large part of the art of advertising is telling the same story, over and over, but in new and entertaining ways (e.g. the hero saves the day and the bad guy loses).

The negative binomial distribution (NBD) pattern of buying shown in Chapter 4 is a sobering reminder of why brands need to be consistent. This skewed purchasing pattern is matched by a similar pattern of media consumption and advertising viewing. A few consumers have noticed a band’s advertising, while the vast bulk of the brand’s consumers hardily ever see any – and when they do, it is a long time between exposures. Even the slightest inconsistency is confusing. Not that consumers are often confused by advertising (in the sense of feeling frustrated) – they rarely engage enough with advertising for this to happen. Confusing advertising simply washes over them; they don’t take it in.

Packaging changes are particularly hard on a brand’s legion of occasional buyers. This is why there are so many stories of companies changing a pack and experiencing a sudden and dramatic drop in sales.

### Rule 7: Stay competitive – *don’t give a reason not to buy*

Evaluation is over-rated. Brands largely compete in terms of mental and physical availability. This doesn’t mean that product features, and consumer evaluation, aren’t important – just that they operate within this battle for attention.

When people go to buy a brand, a huge part of the selection process (yet a part they hardly notice; they don’t even think of it as part of the decision) is the act of not noticing and/or not considering most options. A buyer evaluates and selects a very limited number of brands – the ones that are noticed or recalled, which often can be a single brand. So while positive features and perceptions help a brand to be chosen, they only do so when they are part of the selection set (i.e.
