What about Harley-Davidson then? In 2013 in *AdAge* their Chief Marketing Officer said that they weren’t in the transportation category but rather lifestyle. The implication is that they don’t compete with other brands of motorbike (like Triumph, Ducati, BSA and many others). Their marketing emphasis is on encouraging owners to feel that they are members of the tribe. They spend only 15% on traditional media, “The rest is spent on riding with customers and trying to create ‘epic’ experiences like the big bike party in Rome.” Harley invites its freedom-loving customers to share their own stories via the Fan Machine app on the company’s Facebook page, where it has nearly 4.7 million ‘fans’. It then casts real riders, found among its 133,000 Twitter followers, in the ads.

Yet a segmentation analysis of US Harley-Davidson riders (Swinyard 1995) shows that the largest segment (40% of owners) receive little psychological satisfaction from riding, nor are they tribe members or ever likely to be.
