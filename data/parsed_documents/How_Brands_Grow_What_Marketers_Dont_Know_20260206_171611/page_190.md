6. Be consistent, yet fresh and interesting.  
7. Stay competitive, keep up the mass appeal; don’t give customers reasons not to buy the brand.

## Rule 1: Reach

Reach all consumers of the brand’s service/product category, both with physical distribution and marketing communication. All these people are potential buyers of the brand. Examine marketing options in terms of their ability to cost effectively reach as many customers as possible. Avoid strategies that fail to reach non-buyers or light buyers of the brand – most of the brand’s sales potential lies with these customers. Reach across geographical space, time and situations. Avoid going ‘off air’. Avoid narrow descriptions of the brand’s target market that are out of sync with who really buys the brand. Understand who buys, when, and how the brand fits into their lives. Stop talking about your average buyer – there is a wide variety of consumers.

## Rule 2: Be easy to buy

Physical and mental availability drive market share because they make the brand easier to buy, for more people, in more situations, across time and space. This requires research to appreciate how consumers buy, and how they fit the brand into their lives. You also need to look out for emerging ‘reasons not to buy’, barriers to building penetration like missing pack types or sizes, or prices that are too high.

It’s often flippantly stated that the reason for a particular brand’s high market share is ‘convenience’. This is a shallow explanation; it requires considerable research to work out what convenience is for one product category compared with another. For example, it’s been said that Wal-Mart was initially laughed at in the early 1980s when it built large stores outside of city centres. Some said this was too inconvenient, without appreciating the American trend (of the time) of shopping by car and the convenience of having a large range of merchandise in one location. Similarly, Laura and Al Ries predicted the early demise of the iPhone (“after a short period where Apple would sell quite a few iPhones … to early adopters and elites”). They said it would fail because the convenience of an all-in-one device was over-rated<sup>97</sup>. In 2007 Apple surprised the world by selling one million iPhones in the first 74 days of its release. A year later, the second generation iPhone sold one million units in just two days: the weekend of its launch. Well more than 500 million have now been sold, obviously to more than just ‘early adopters and elites’!
