“There is no product on the planet that enjoys the devotion of a Macintosh computer. Famously dedicated to their machines, many Mac fans eat, sleep and breathe Macintosh” (‘The Cult of the Mac’ by Leander Kahney, 2004).

‘Baba Shiv, a professor of marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, compares Apple’s fan base to Harley-Davidson motorcycle riders who pass over arguably higher-quality Japanese bikes” (‘Apple fans loyal despite iPod, iphone 3G woes’, CNN, Fox News, 2008)<sup>55</sup>.

Brands like Harley-Davidson and Apple are the poster children for emotion-based brand loyalty. They are regularly cited as having passionate, highly loyal customer bases – though few writers provide evidence to back up such claims. Also, no one questions why this loyalty failed to protect Harley-Davidson from losing market share to Japanese brands, or Apple to PC clones.

I’m sure it is true that tattoo engravers (if this is the right word) receive more requests for Harley-Davidson tattoos than they do for Kelloggs Cornflakes tattoos (this slightly ludicrous example provided by Parker and Stuart 1997) but this says more about the respective product categories than it does about loyalty. And the fact that Harley-Davidson riders are more likely to have tattoos of any sort than the average breakfast cereal buyer (i.e. a statistical selection effect). And that first purchases of motorbikes and tattoos tend to coincide, whereas consumers tend to be first introduced to Cornflakes at an age when their mum won’t allow them to get a tattoo, even if they wanted one!

What are the buying facts about Apple and Harley-Davidson loyalty? First, just like other brands, their customers are polygamously loyal to a number of brands. The Harley-Davidson’s share of category requirements (SCR) metric is reported at about 33%. In other words, Harley-Davidson buyers purchase other bikes twice as often as they buy Harleys. This is a very normal sort of loyalty figure for a brand. Similarly, Apple’s repeat-buying level is much lower than 100% and is not very different from its competitors; see Table 7.5.

**Table 7.5:** Apple owners show only moderately higher than expected loyalty

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand repeat purchase percentages, highlighting customer loyalty across different manufacturers. Dell leads with the highest repeat purchase rate at 71%, indicating strong customer retention. Apple follows with a repeat rate of 55%, demonstrating a significant level of customer loyalty. HP/Compaq is positioned third, with a repeat purchase percentage of 52%. The structure is a simple ranking, illustrating a direct comparison of a single metric—repeat purchase percentage—across three distinct brands. This suggests a hierarchy of customer loyalty, with Dell at the apex, followed by Apple, and then HP/Compaq. Given what we know about the double jeopardy law (see Chapter 2), Apple’s repeat-buying level is slightly high; that is, more Apple owners make their next purchase an Apple computer than we would expect, given Apple’s market share.
