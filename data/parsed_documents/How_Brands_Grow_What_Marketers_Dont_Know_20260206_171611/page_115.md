However, it turns out that personality perceptions are like all other image attributes (i.e. users of different brands see their respective brands in much the same way). But brand personality perceptions score very poorly – it turns out that consumers are reluctant to view brands as people (i.e. only 5% think brand X is rugged)<sup>59</sup> – see Romaniuk & Ehrenberg 2012. These perceptions, that are weakly held by the population, are also weakly held by individuals (of the 5% who think the brand is rugged in one interview, only about a quarter of these people (about 1%) will repeat the assertion when re-interviewed). Yet a number of marketers adopted the brand personality concept without asking for such empirical evidence first – like medieval doctors (see Chapter 1).

# Unique associations

If brands were really differentiated in the minds of consumers, we might expect successful brands to have unique image attributes (i.e. consumers associate an image with only one brand). It’s long been argued that brand equity rests on strong and unique associations. But a thorough examination of the image data of 130 brands in 13 product and service categories shows that people rarely (about 3% of the time) see a single brand as being exclusively associated with a particular image (Gaillard & Romaniuk 2007). More successful brands do not have proportionally more unique associations, nor do customers with greater preference for a brand hold more unique associations than those with less preference. Instead, the level of brand uniqueness – as designated by the proportion of associations customers hold for one brand only – has been shown to be simply negatively correlated with the number of brands in the category. A brand is more likely to be perceived as the only brand with a particular quality if it has few competitors.

# Meaningful differentiation

Differentiation is deemed to be an essential part of marketing strategy. It is taught more like religion than hard-nosed business. Differentiated brands are supposed to inherit all the customers and profits; it’s all or nothing and we are told we must ‘differentiate or die’ (Trout & Rivkin 2000).  
Marketing texts use a motivational perspective – they talk of a meaningful, perceived difference that provides buyers with their reason to purchase and be loyal to a brand (Aaker 2001; Kotler 1994). Undifferentiated new entrants to a market are supposed to be likely to fail because no customer is motivated to buy them (Davidson 1976).
