Also, great sales effective advertising does not always need to persuade. In a series of Ehrenberg-bass Institute studies on the forms that advertisements take (FAT) (Mills et al 2000), where the general public, agency professionals and students assessed television and magazine ads, only 40-50% of the assessments thought the ads suggested or claimed that their brand was different or better, or provided helpful information. This suggests there is no simple basis on which these ads could successfully persuade. Others (e.g. Morgan et al 1995; Kay 1993) have also noted that most advertisements contain very little verbal or visual information about the advertised brand.

The persuasion mechanism does not explain most of the advertising in the world. Many brands are already successful. They do not have anything to say that the market does not already know, that a competitor could not say or is meaningful to their buyers. Yet it’s commonly assumed that without persuasion advertising can’t cause sales, but this is not true. Memory structures, even if they don’t result in intentions, still cause sales – decades of research (e.g. Juster 1960) shows that sales can mostly come from people who had no intention of buying. Intentions are memories too, and subject to faulty recall so they are only weakly motivational. A similar point can be made about brand preference or attitude. Some advertising generates a reaction like ‘that’s good’ or ‘that would suit me’. Again, it is commonly assumed that such persuasive advertising must be more effective in generating sales. Such attitudes are usually very weakly motivational. This is partly because they are not often recalled in buying situations and also because we often have a large number of brands we like (and that we buy).
