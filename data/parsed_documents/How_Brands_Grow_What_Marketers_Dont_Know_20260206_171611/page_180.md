Buyers use different attributes at different points in time. Context can matter a lot; for example, ice-creams are more likely to be recalled as a food or treat option at the beach and during holidays. Buyers can also use multiple attributes on a single occasion (e.g. convenient and a treat). The attributes can come from anything relevant to the buying context. So it is necessary for marketers to have a broad understanding of the thought processes that consumers go through before they even think of any brands as options to buy. Researching this isn’t just a matter of asking consumers, because much of this memory functioning is subconscious.

# Cue competitors

Different cues also mean that different competitors are likely to be thought of as options by the buyer at any one time. Competitive options don’t even have to be in the same product category. For example, ‘something to wake me up’ can conjure a coffee, or Starbucks, a Red Bull, a Pepsi, a brisk walk, or a swim. When marketers think of competitors they often think of functional look-alikes. However, it is better to think of competitors as ‘cue competitors’. Competitors are all other options linked to the cue, as these are most likely to be thought of and compete for selection.

# The importance of distinctive brand assets

Over time brands build memory structures; most of these are very simple, such as associations with colour, pack shape, fonts and tone.

These associations are vital because they allow consumers to recognise a brand and its advertising. In other words, associations allow a brand’s communications to do their job of refreshing salience and building new memory structures. Without these distinctive brand assets it is difficult for consumers to digest a brand’s communications. Failure to employ these distinctive elements in communication can also mean that existing customers screen out the communication as they do for the brands that they don’t use.

So the maintenance of mental availability depends on the quality of branding and advertising. Distinctive, consistent icons and imagery build memory associations that allow a brand to be noticed and recalled in a range of buying situations. This is a huge part of brand custodianship, yet it is often overlooked; marketers often fail to deploy a brand’s distinctive assets and, in effect, they sabotage them.
