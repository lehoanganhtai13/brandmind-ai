Buyers are polygamous; brands share consumers. In the long term, 23% market share means that most category consumers use Hertz, but on average, they only use Hertz not much more than 23% of the time.

The story is similar with attitudes, perceptions and intentions (i.e. people’s thoughts about brands). If surveys show that 30% of people say Hertz rents attractive cars then the common assumption is that 30% of people believe this and 70% don’t. While the reality is that a lot of people believe this (or remember they believe this), but just not all of the time.

Let me explain. We can see the fickle (actually probabilistic) nature of people’s beliefs if we ask them the same question more than once. This is seldom done in market and social research. Surveys generally ask different people each time, which is why even experienced market researchers are generally unaware of this phenomenon.<sup>49</sup> If, on the first survey, 30% of people agreed with the statement, “Hertz rents attractive cars”, then on any subsequent survey the figure is also usually very close to 30%. This (misleadingly) suggests that the individuals largely always give the same response, either agreeing or not agreeing with the statement. But, if we analyse the answers of each individual we see something startling. Typically, only about half the people who on the first survey agreed with the statement do so again on the second survey, and an equal number of people who did not agree with the statement the first time now agree with it. So the overall level of agreement remains at 30% but the repeat or stability rate (people saying yes both times) is only half (i.e. 50%). Scale-type questions show the same instability.

**Table 7.3:** Image belief stability survey to survey, Australian banks, small & medium size business respondents

This data presents a comparative analysis of customer agreement with the statement "friendly and helpful" across four Australian banks: CBA, Westpac, NAB, and ANZ. It tracks agreement levels across two survey response levels (RL1 and RL2) and calculates the repeat rate (RR) for those who initially agreed. CBA shows the highest initial agreement (30% in RL1) and the highest agreement in the second survey (35% in RL2), alongside the highest repeat rate of 57%. Westpac and NAB exhibit identical initial agreement (19% in RL1) and second survey agreement (20% in RL2), with repeat rates of 48% and 45% respectively. ANZ has the lowest initial agreement (16% in RL1) and second survey agreement (17% in RL2), with a repeat rate of 44%. The data indicates an average repeat rate of 49% across these banks and a strong positive correlation (r=0.98) between the initial agreement level and the repeat rate, suggesting that higher initial agreement is strongly associated with sustained agreement. *Source: Survey data from Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, University of South Australia.*
