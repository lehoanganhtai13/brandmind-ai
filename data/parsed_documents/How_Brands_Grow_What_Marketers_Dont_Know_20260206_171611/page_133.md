Mostly, advertising is used to prevent what (without advertising) would be a very gentle decline in sales. Broadbent (1989) provides an apt analogy of this: “The sales of a brand are like the height at which an airplane flies. Advertising spend is like its engines: while the engines are running everything is fine, but when the engines stop, the descent eventually starts”. Much advertising is aimed at preventing competitors’ advertising from stealing future sales. This prevention means a brand enjoys sales, over a long period of time, that it would not have otherwise obtained if it had not advertised. So advertising causes sales even if a brand’s sales figures are flat.

* Advertising’s sales effects are spread out in time. This means that the effect of today’s advertising is layered very thinly across weekly sales figures over a long time period. It typically takes dramatic bursts of expenditure to cause a week’s figures to detectably increase. This is particularly the case for large brands, because their advertising expenditure is small in comparison to their other marketing efforts, such as their ongoing word of mouth, their sheer physical presence (shelf space is advertising too) and the already established mental availability (past advertising effects) in many consumers’ heads. Changes in advertising weight are more likely to make weekly sales figures of a small brand move up and down because it doesn’t have a large base of sales that are supported by existing market-based assets.

Consequently, statistical models of changes in advertising spend and changes in overall sales report a weak association. But if we look below the surface and divide the consumers who were exposed to the advertising from those who are not, then we can see sales effects that were previously masked. The value of ‘single source’ individual-level data is illustrated in Figure 9.1, where the data shows that despite declining sales (because of competitive pressure) the brand’s advertising really was generating purchases among those consumers who saw the ad.
