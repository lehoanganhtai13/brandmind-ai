Margaret is demanding an explanation. What does this mean? Why is Colgate’s sales base so unhealthy? Is the brand doomed? What does this mean for her ambitious growth targets?

How would you answer?

Of course, you would call for more research. It’s an Insight Director’s prerogative.

The additional research further breaks down the market share of each company by analysing the switchers within both the Crest and Colgate customer bases.

The additional research consists of a survey; the first question of which asks customers about their attitudinal loyalty. Figure 1.4 reports the percentage of switchers who agree with the statement: “This is my preferred brand”, (the switcher group is the interesting one, as we can safely assume that both Crest’s and Colgate’s loyals will report that their brand is their preferred one.) As you can see, Figure 1.4 shows that Crest switchers are substantially more likely to say that Crest is their preferred brand.

The survey’s second question asks customers about their perceptions of quality. Figure 1.5 reports the quality perceptions of the switchers in each customer base. Both Crest and Colgate buyers perceive both brands to be quality products – as they should, because these are both well researched and well-made products.
