This data presents a comparative analysis of cola buyer purchasing frequency, specifically for Coca-Cola, detailing the percentage of buyers who purchase at a given frequency per year. The structure is a direct mapping of purchase instances to buyer proportions. It shows that a significant portion of buyers, 32%, purchase Coca-Cola once per year, with decreasing percentages for higher purchase frequencies. Notably, 18% buy twice annually, and 10% buy three times. As the frequency increases, the percentage of buyers diminishes, with 7% buying four times and 4% buying five times. Frequencies beyond five purchases show progressively smaller buyer segments, with 1% buying ten times and a cumulative less than 0.5% buying between 13 and 52 times per year, indicating a concentration of purchasing behavior at lower frequencies.

> If you buy yourself a Coca-cola more than 3 times a year then you are one of Coke’s heavy buyers!

What do the buying frequencies look like for smaller brands? They are surprisingly similar. Let’s look at Pepsi, which is a considerably smaller brand in this market (see Figure 4.2).

The average Pepsi buyer in this market buys Pepsi only nine times a year, which is somewhat lighter than the average Coca-Cola buyer (c.f. 12). There are many more cola buyers who don’t buy Pepsi in a year – more than 50%, compared to the 30% who didn’t buy Coke that year. This is because Pepsi is a smaller brand. But again, a heavy buyer for Pepsi is anyone who buys more than three times a year.
