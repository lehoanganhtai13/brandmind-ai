Most categories have price/quality tiers: the cheap/basic, no-added-frills level; the mainstream level; and the level of higher priced products that have added luxury or functionality. Consumers are aware of this tier system, so considering context is important when evaluating the prices people are willing to pay. It is apparent that consumers will pay for quality: the prices for higher quality brands are higher than the prices for lower quality brands, and the higher quality brands do well year after year. We also see that, generally, the very best brands are considerably more expensive, and the very cheapest brands are often considerably lower quality – if you really want quality, you have to pay for it, and if you want a low price then you have to make other sacrifices.

We will now examine these questions: How do consumers behave in relation to price? Are there ‘deal buyers’ and ‘premium buyers’? We will also outline the managerial motivation for running price promotions and reveal what actually happens when price promotions are run. The question of longer-term effects (good or bad) is also addressed. Finally, we will discuss the capacity of price promotions to actually reach buyers.

# Consumers buy across a range of price levels

Marketers and researchers find it tempting to categorise shoppers according to the prices they pay. For example, it is thought that there are low-end shoppers, those who buy in the middle range and others who buy premium products. The notion of the ‘deal-prone’ shopper reinforces this view. However, research into actual buying behaviour shows that consumers do not confine themselves to one price category. Most consumers buy across a range of prices – over time they will buy the same brand at different prices and also buy brands that sit at different prices. This might be because of availability, promotions, something catching their eye, differing needs, mood swings, wanting a change, granny coming to visit and so on. These many random influences result in law-like patterns in cross-buying at different price levels. For example, Table 10.1 shows that in the instant coffee market in the UK about half (51%) of those buying in the cheapest price range (denoted as ‘- -‘) also bought in the most expensive price range (‘+ +’). Similarly, of those buying in the below-average price range (‘-‘), 57% also bought in the most expensive price range, and so on. Overall, these patterns are dictated by the number of people who buy in each price range, much like the double jeopardy law for brand buying described in Chapter 2.
