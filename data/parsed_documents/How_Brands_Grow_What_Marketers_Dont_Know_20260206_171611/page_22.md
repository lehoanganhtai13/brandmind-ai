The scientific revolution transformed medical practice as doctors, and statisticians such as Florence Nightingale, started compiling detailed records and case histories. The numbers they recorded started to generate insight into causes and effects, and germ theory eventually triumphed over humoural imbalance theory. Medical experiments gradually started separating the effectual from the ineffectual and the downright dangerous.

Today marketing managers operate a bit like nineteenth century doctors; they are affected by the scientific revolution, but are not yet governed by it. Even ‘best practice’ is still dominated by impressions and untested assumptions. Texts still contain untested, ungrounded theories and myths. And serious experimentation is rare.

The marketing equivalent of humoural imbalance theory may be the Kotlerian ‘differentiate or die’ world view where marketing success is entirely about creating superior products, selling these at a premium price, targeting the most likely buyers, and advertising to bring people’s minds around to the product’s superiority.

You are reading a book about real-world facts and law-like relationships that challenge the fundamental tenets of modern marketing theory; the widespread beliefs that affect not just the decisions of marketing managers, but also how marketers see the world.

# Commonplace marketing mistakes

Even the most intelligent marketers, in the best organisations, routinely make mistakes. Because many marketers operate using incorrect assumptions about how buyers buy and how marketing works, they emphasise the wrong things and ignore important points, consequently making mistakes such as:

* changing packaging in ways that reduce the brand’s ability to be noticed
* creating advertising that doesn’t build or refresh relevant memory structures
* failing to research what memory structures are devoted to the brand
* failing to research what makes the brand distinctive and noticeable
* creating advertising that isn’t branded (other than a flash of the brand name) * investing countless hours and many dollars on pointless tracking research that informs no decisions
