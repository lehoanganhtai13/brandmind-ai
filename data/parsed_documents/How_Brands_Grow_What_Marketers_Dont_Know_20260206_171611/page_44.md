# Even growing brands lose customers

Halving defections is neither easy nor cheap, and permanently reducing customer defection to zero is fantasy. Also, the growth potential from customer acquisition is much higher.

The double jeopardy law describes normal markets where brands typically aren’t growing or declining substantially. What about dynamics? What role does defection play in delivering growth? Does defection reduce dramatically while a brand is growing? Does acquisition rise dramatically? Or, does growth come from a combination of both? Is growth dependent on marketing strategy? It turns out that the answer to these questions is very simple: growth is due to extraordinary acquisition. Contraction is due to dismal acquisition.

Erica Riebe (2003) examined the dynamics of customer base growth and contraction in her doctoral research. She examined both growing and declining pharmaceutical brands over 10 years.[18] For each brand she calculated the amount of acquisition and defection it should have had given the market norm and the size of the brand (i.e. if a brand’s customer base was stable then its acquisition and defection levels should be equal, and will depend on the size of the brand). She expected that growing brands might show excess acquisition and lower-than-expected defection. That is, together these two factors would contribute to the growth in the customer base. Surprisingly, she found that growth was almost entirely due to particularly high acquisition. The declining brands showed a similar pattern but in reverse: their defection rates were healthy and matched stable brands of similar market share, but their acquisition rates were poor.

Riebe (2003) replicated this research in France (looking at shampoo and chocolate bars). Using twelve months of panel data she compared each panel member’s favourite brand in the first six months with his or her favourite in the second six months. This allowed Riebe to calculate, for each brand, how many ‘first brand loyals’ it gained and lost. The shampoo category turned out to be too stable, with the customer bases of the brands not changing. But in the chocolate category, where there was some movement, the same pattern was seen as in pharmaceuticals – customer base growth was mostly due to excelling in acquisition.

This research was later extended with further analysis and Nielsen provided four-and-a-half years of banking data. Again, it was good customer acquisition that led to growth, and poor acquisition that caused decline (Riebe et al. 2014).
