packaging front and back

I first saw a Yorkie chocolate bar in a London corner store and was surprised by the packaging: it featured the slogan, “It’s not for girls!” and had a picture of a girl that was crossed out. This packaging looks like a serious attempt to gain a segmented customer base: men.

Of course, this is cheeky British humour, designed to get the brand, and its television advertising, noticed. <sup>27</sup> However, decades before Nestle adopted this slogan, Yorkie ads consistently stressed the large chunks of chocolate<sup>28</sup> and very much targeted blue-collar, male workers. Most of the original advertising featured truck drivers enjoying Yorkie bars<sup>29</sup>. After a long gap, or a period of unmemorable advertising, the “It’s not for girls!” campaign was launched – perhaps as a return to the brand’s historic roots. As one commentator noted, “From the ads they seem to be targeting not ‘British men’ but British, large, bearded, macho, builders. That’s got to be a limited market …” (Redfern, 2002). But either the market got the joke or the targeting failed because this is what the user base of Yorkie looks like today:

**Table 5.6:** Percentage of Yorkie bar buyers: male versus female over different product variants

This data presents a comparative analysis of brand preferences between males and females, focusing on three specific Yorkie chocolate bar varieties. The structure is a simple two-by-four matrix, with 'Gender' as the primary categorical variable and 'Total brand' and three distinct Yorkie flavors serving as the measured attributes. For each gender, the table quantifies the total brand engagement and the specific engagement with 'Yorkie - Milk', 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit', and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. The data reveals differing preferences, with males showing higher engagement in total brand and 'Yorkie - Milk', while females exhibit a stronger preference for 'Yorkie - raisin & biscuit' and 'Yorkie - the nutter'. This highlights a gender-based divergence in the consumption patterns of these particular chocolate products.
