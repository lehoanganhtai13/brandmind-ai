Price promotions are popular with managers because the results are easy to see. More stock is sold. If a brand is sold through retailer outlets, sales tracking immediately shows an impressive spike. The immediacy is attractive. This may be important for a company that needs to transform inventory into money. There are other related reasons – such as managers being under pressure to make unit sales budgets. Price promotions deliver these results, but they also lead to next year’s volume targets that require more price discounting. Price promotions can become a way of life for organisations because winding them back would result in failing to hit sales targets. Therefore, such promotions are highly addictive for marketers.

Another reason for the popularity of these discounts is that distribution channels (such as retailers) demand them, because a retailer can then offer discounts to consumers and build an image of good value. Discounts at the retail level also allow a retailer to maintain competitive pressure on its rivals. Therefore, price promotions on the part of manufacturers can be one of the costs of maintaining good relationships with retail distributors. Unfortunately, in-store promotions empower the distributor because the market share of the brand becomes dependent on the distributor’s decisions. Price promotions can also ‘buy time’ for a brand – boost sales in the short term or save it from being delisted. However, something must be done while the clock is ticking, and there is evidence that more emphasis on price promotions is accompanied by lower emphasis on innovation (Pauwels et al., 2004). Finally, it may be that price promotions are so popular because it is hard to think of more creative ideas for brand strategy.

# Price promotions don’t win new customers

Some marketers believe that price cuts attract new customers to buy a brand: customers who might later come back and make more purchases at full price. However, there is little evidence this occurs. Ehrenberg, Hammond and Goodhardt (1994) found that almost everyone who bought a brand during a price promotion had bought the brand previously. Some academic researchers have even found that some sales in a price promotion have been brought forward from future sales, so the spike in volume at the time of the sale is cancelled out to some degree because of lower sales post promotion. Fortunately, the evidence is that the main effect is brand substitution, not forward buying.
