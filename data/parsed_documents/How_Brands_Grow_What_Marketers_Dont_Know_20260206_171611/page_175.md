* Which brand a buyer purchases (from the one or few brands they happened to consider on the day) depends on a myriad of factors that relate to the situation and circumstances. Sometimes a buyer is feeling extravagant, frugal, patriotic, etc. Evaluation criteria can, and do, change ‘on the fly’. So any actual evaluation that occurs can vary wildly each time a customer goes to buy.

Evaluation is therefore less important and less predictable than our market research techniques assume.

So why are some brands much more popular than others? Why, in the US, are many more Fords sold than Renaults? A part of the answer might be that when buyers actively consider both Ford and Renault they prefer Ford – perhaps Ford is better? Yet this is odd because in some markets, like France, Renault outsells Ford. Also, Renault owners throughout the world report similar satisfaction to Ford owners. The main answer to the question is that many more car buyers remember to consider Ford than Renault. In most markets Renault seldom gets a look in. This is not because people dislike Renault or think that it lacks desirable features. It is just that, outside of France, few people think of Renault[^89]. So the big marketing issue is how to get a brand thought of, more often, in more buying situations; in other words, how to build mental availability.

In any market, many more people buy one brand over another or an individual buys one brand more than he or she buys all the others. This phenomenon typically leads to the intuitive, but largely incorrect, conclusion that there must be a large perceived difference between brands. But differences in perceived product features (or brand image/positioning) only marginally explain why one brand is chosen more or less than another. It is screening out behaviour (and physical availability) that largely explains the vast and continuing market share differences that exist between even highly similar brands.

This suggests a simple prescription: get people to think of a brand. Yet there is nothing simple about this. One of the hardest ongoing battles any marketer faces is to get light, occasional and non-customers to think of their brand. Buyers have too many other more interesting (non-marketing) things to think about. Even brands with plenty of customers still have to fight for customers’ attention. Buyers have so many other things going on in their lives that each category (let alone brand) purchase is trivial. What a battle it is for all the vast number of brands in the market to strive for snippets of attention[^90]. This gives us a major clue into how brands compete for buying occasions.
