# Special thanks

Thank you to the readers of the original version of this book for making it such a success. Thank you for your kind words, and your very interesting questions - please keep asking them, you can contact me through the book’s official website.

I would like especially to thank my wife Anne and daughter Lilith, and my colleagues in the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, University of South Australia. I would also like to thank our collaborators at universities around the world – especially Professor Jerry Wind at Wharton.

Special thanks also are due to Dr Thomas Bayne at Mountainview Learning for working with me to introduce behavioural science to marketing executives around the world. The graduates from this training are ushering in a new era of evidence-based marketing for the corporations they work for.

# E-book version

Hundreds of small improvements have been made to this new version. New material has been added on:  
* category growth  
* profitability and loyalty  
* industrial buying  
* an additional law on physical availability and growth  
* a ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ chapter  
* an expanded bibliography pointing readers to the many relevant peer-reviewed scientific publications.

There are new examples and data, for example, new tables showing Apple’s brand loyalty. A number of tables have been updated that will allay any fears that the scientific laws might not continue to apply.
