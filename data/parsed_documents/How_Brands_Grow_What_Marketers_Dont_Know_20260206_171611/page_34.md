Yet many large corporations make good offers to their own employees and are disappointed by the response rate. If selling new products to your own employees is difficult, then cross-selling to existing customers might not be so easy after all.

Cross-selling metrics are another measurement of loyalty, so once again we find the double jeopardy law applies. There is very little difference in cross-selling metrics between competing brands, and the small differences that do exist tend to reflect market share – not whether or not they have dedicated cross-selling programs.

Tables 2.7 and 2.8 provide data on cross-selling metrics for insurance and banking, respectively.

**Table 2.7:** Cross-selling metrics for insurance

This data presents a comparative analysis of insurance providers in Australia, detailing their market penetration and the average number of products held by their customers. The structure is comparative, highlighting differences and similarities across several key providers. RAA demonstrates the highest market penetration at 16%, closely followed by CGU at 14% and SGIC at 13%. AAMI and APIA show lower market penetration, at 9% and 6% respectively. In terms of customer product holding, the average is consistently around 1.4 to 1.5 products per customer across all listed providers, with AAMI, SGIC, and RAA customers holding an average of 1.5 products, while CGU and APIA customers hold an average of 1.4 products. The overall average for market penetration across these providers is 12%, with an average of 1.5 products held per customer.

**Table 2.8:** Cross-selling metrics for banking

This data presents a comparative analysis of the average number of banking products held by customers across four major Australian banks: Commonwealth Bank, ANZ Bank, Westpac Bank, and National Australia Bank. The structure is a simple comparison of a single metric—average products per customer—for each entity. Commonwealth Bank customers hold an average of 2 products, followed closely by ANZ Bank with 2.1 products. Westpac Bank customers average 2.2 products, and National Australia Bank customers hold the highest average at 2.3 products. The overall average across all listed banks is 2.1 products per customer, indicating a relatively consistent customer engagement with banking products across these institutions.

The insurance data shows very little difference in the success of cross-selling by the competing brands. In banking there is a little more variation, but oddly there appears to be a slight reverse of the double jeopardy pattern where the two smaller brands have marginally higher customer loyalty. This is due to the two smaller brands being skewed towards business banking and having a consumer base of wealthier customers who hold more financial products overall, while the two larger brands are particularly successful in one product (e.g.
