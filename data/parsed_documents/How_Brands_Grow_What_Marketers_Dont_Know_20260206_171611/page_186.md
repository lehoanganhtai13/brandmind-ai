LES DOUCEURS DE McDONALD'S POURQUOI RÉSISTER?

A classic example of exploiting neglected, market-based assets occurred near my office in the 1990s. A large wine company, Seppelt, purchased a small, old, run-down Barossa Valley winery by the name of ‘Queen Adelaide’. The Queen Adelaide winery had begun in 1858; its wines had once been popular, but were now mostly seen in dusty bargain bins. The Seppelt winemakers took this brand and combined their modern, quality wine (nothing flash or expensive but clean with clear fruit) with the Queen Adelaide label. Almost overnight, Queen Adelaide became the largest-selling chardonnay in Australia. I don’t think the old Queen Adelaide even had a chardonnay in its range, but chardonnay was now popular and Queen Adelaide was still a very well-known brand. A decent marketing mix and already established market-based assets re-created a big-selling brand very quickly. This gave Seppelt a fabulous financial return on its purchase of a run-down, old winery.

The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute recently analysed submissions for the advertising effectiveness awards in Australia (similar to the Effies in the US). It’s well known that such awards tend to attract new product campaigns, because it’s easier for them to show the effects of their advertising when they start from sales of zero (and the advertising gets the credit for the success of the new product).
