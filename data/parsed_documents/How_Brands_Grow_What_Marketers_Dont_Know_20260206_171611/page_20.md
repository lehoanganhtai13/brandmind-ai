If your answers were questioned, could you point to anything more than anecdotes to support your view?

**Table 1.1: Strategic assumptions test**

This table presents a series of strategic assumptions related to brand management and marketing, each requiring a True, False, or Don't Know assessment. The assumptions explore core tenets of marketing strategy, including the importance of brand differentiation, the interpretation of loyalty metrics, the cost-effectiveness of customer retention versus acquisition, and the impact of price promotions on penetration versus loyalty. Further assumptions delve into competitive dynamics influenced by brand image positioning, the viability of mass marketing, and the existence of unique customer motivations and buyer personas. Finally, it includes a common heuristic regarding the Pareto principle's application to customer purchasing behavior, specifically the contribution of the heaviest 20% of customers to overall sales. The structure is comparative, posing distinct strategic statements for evaluation.

If you answer true to most of the questions above then you are operating under false assumptions. This book will give you the evidence. As Mark Twain wrote in his notebook in 1898: “Education consists mainly of what we have unlearned”.

Science’s systematic approach to discovery is a relatively recent practice that didn’t really get going until around the 1700s. Prior to that, knowledge largely came from myth, folk-tale, and from experts in authority (chiefs, priests, kings and queens). How these ‘experts’ acquired their knowledge no-one knew or dared ask. Most of the time their understanding was wrong and there were glaring gaps. This lack of accurate knowledge meant we didn’t think to ask useful questions. So for millions of years humans made little progress; life was typically short, painful and we were hungry and cold much of the time. In the past few hundred years we’ve made extraordinary progress.
