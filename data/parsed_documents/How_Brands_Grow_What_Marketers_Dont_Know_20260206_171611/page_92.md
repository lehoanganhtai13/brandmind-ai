However, Tucker’s study was limited and somewhat artificial. It could be argued that buyers are used to more substantial differences in real-world brands and so acted as if there might be in this study. Also, tastes vary day by day, and maybe the bread varied too – if one day a loaf didn’t taste so good to a subject perhaps she avoided that brand on the following days. Even so, the study did show that consumers have a predilection to adopt loyalty behaviours, for whatever reason. This is further shown by the fact that brand loyalty is a characteristic of every market.

In Chapter 3 we saw that repeat-purchasing levels for car brands are quite high. That is, around 50% repeat levels (with some variation between countries); almost half the time new car buyers buy the same brand as they bought last time. This level of repeat-buying seems incredible considering that in modern market economies there are typically 60 or so brands to choose from. Also, usually a number of years pass between purchases, models change, as do buyer’s life circumstances and needs. The odds of someone choosing the same car brand again appears to be very slim. If buying were random, there would be less than 1 chance in 50 of a person purchasing the same brand again. But buying is not random; there is clear behavioural preference and loyalty.

We observe this sort of loyalty in all categories, including service categories and corporate buying. Buyers restrict their purchases to a personal repertoire of brands. People buy far fewer different brands than they could. Ten purchases seldom results in ten different brands being bought. Buyers keep returning to their favourites<sup>42</sup>, and this set of favourites can be very small. The 50% repeat-buying rate for car brands occurs because buyers consider only around two brands on average; one of which is usually the brand they bought last time (i.e. the brand they drive now) (Lambert-Pandraud 2005). About a fifth of buyers consider only a single brand, which is almost always the one they bought last (Lapersonne 1995). Yet this is what consumer behaviour textbooks refer to as a ‘highly involving purchase decision’!

Here’s another surprising example. The choice of which television channel to watch is a category where loyalty is unexpected. Most of us think we watch television for the programs, and, aside from the genre-specific channels (e.g. the weather channel), we have only a vague idea of what channel offers our favourite programs. Also, there are no real switching costs: we can defect from one channel by pushing a button. In spite of all this, television channel choice shows the same pattern as other categories – people substantially restrict their repertoires and show loyalty.
