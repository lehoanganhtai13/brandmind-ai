In many cases, managers have other motives for running price promotions than just chasing sales spikes. A commonly cited reason for manufacturers to run promotions is to please or placate the retailer. In the long run this may be the only justifiable reason for price promotions, but if maintaining retailer relations is the objective of a price promotion then this should be the metric that is evaluated – yet such evaluation is seldom done in any formal sense.

To conclude, much price discounting is significantly costly: it erodes brand margins for the benefit of the retailer and consumer. The advice to brand owners is to think long and hard about what price-cutting activity is achieving in the long term, and try to reverse the long-term trend of marketing money being transferred from brand-building activities to discounting. Ask how many price promotions are really needed to avoid delisting from a retailer, and avoid doing more than this.
