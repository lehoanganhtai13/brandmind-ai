Since then TV viewing has not declined, in fact it has increased!

Meanwhile the advertising performance of many new media has turned out to be far less impressive than expected. Some, like Facebook, offer the potential of great reach in the sense of OTS (opportunities to see) but have turned out to be far less able to actually reach the brains of consumers which seem to be distracted by talking to their friends than viewing our advertising. More carefully controlled experimentation is needed to work out how to exploit these media.

Sadly much of what passes for research in this area is really disguised promotional material paid for by people seeking to sell advertising space to marketers.

For more information on what has and hasn’t changed see the special issue of the Journal of Advertising Research.

For insight into online video sharing and social media read Karen Nelson-Fields’ book *Viral Marketing: the science of sharing* (Oxford University Press, 2013).

# How do you maintain a consistent presence with a small advertising budget?

Whatever your budget, spend it evenly. Spread your spending over time, don’t bunch your advertising spots, this makes reach cheaper.

Remember, even the largest brands in the world complain that their advertising budgets are too small. Whatever your budget allocate it so you are as continuous as possible. Each month spend around one 12th of your annual budget.

There are many other media guidelines but these haven’t yet been released beyond sponsors of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute. Our new university textbook, *Marketing: Theory, Evidence, Practice* (Oxford University Press, 2012), has a whole chapter on media, plus chapters on advertising and metrics.
