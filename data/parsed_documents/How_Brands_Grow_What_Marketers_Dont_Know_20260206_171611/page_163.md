There is no evidence that outstanding business results are driven by loyalty programs, and in spite of thousands of programs strangely no-one is coming forward showing off their success.

Loyalty programs are still big business. One of the problems with large-scale consumer loyalty programs is that they are difficult for firms to exit from them. Consumers who have accumulated points do not take kindly to losing them. If consumers are told they are losing their points, they tend to place an unrealistic, inflated value on the points – even if they were unlikely to redeem them[^76]. There are also contractual and legal impediments to shutting down a loyalty program, and there are the considerable sunk costs (including management ego) invested in the program. Firms turn out to be quite loyal to their loyalty programs, and tend to continue them far longer than rational economics would recommend.

# Do loyalty programs improve loyalty?

Do loyalty programs affect loyalty? You may be surprised to hear that yes, they do. However, the effect is very weak. The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute published the first large-scale empirical study (see Sharp & Sharp, 1997a) that analysed one of the world’s largest (in terms of retail coverage) loyalty programs in Australia. The study observed a weak effect – an effect that may have been as much to do with the program launch, and its marketing spend, than the program itself.

The technical difficulty in evaluating the effect of loyalty programs on loyalty is to have a baseline to make comparisons from. Simply comparing the behaviour of loyalty program members to non-members is inappropriate because a brand’s more loyal customers will join the program (i.e. a selection effect that occurs because these shoppers have more to gain). Looking for changes in consumers’ behaviour from when the loyalty program was implemented is difficult, because this would require having data on long periods of continuous purchasing before and after the implementation of the program. A long period of data is required to correctly classify the loyalty level of individual consumers because their buying fluctuates. The law of buyer moderation (see Chapter 4) means that many members of loyalty programs will be misclassified as less loyal than they really are. Over time it will look as if these buyers are becoming more loyal and this ‘regression to the mean’ effect will be mistakenly attributed to the loyalty program. One analysis of a very small convenience store loyalty program suffered from this (Liu 2007).
