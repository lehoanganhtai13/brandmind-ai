larger brands have a monopoly on light buyers). For example, if you only buy one soft drink this year, then odds are it will be Coca-Cola. If you buy just one pack of crisps in the UK, then odds are it will be Walkers.

Put another way, if we observe an English person eating Walkers crisps then we know little about their buying. They are simply part of the majority of the UK population who buy Walkers at some time or another. But if we observe someone eating a far smaller brand like Golden Wonder crisps then odds are that the person is higher than average buyer of salty snacks.

The implication for marketing strategy is that to grow a brand needs to recruit more light category buyers. Targeting the heaviest buyers of the category (‘super consumers’) is a bit like saying “let’s be a small brand”.

The natural monopoly law is illustrated with the data in Table 7.2. Heinz buyers purchase tomato sauce four times a year, whereas buyers of C&B sauce buy tomato sauce eight times a year, that is, twice as often<sup>44</sup> (though C&B is only, on average, bought for 1.2 of these eight purchases).

**Table 7.2: Smaller brands are bought by heavier category buyers**

This data presents a comparative analysis of three tomato sauce (ketchup) brands: Heinz, Daddies sauce, and C&B sauce, detailing their market performance. Heinz dominates the market with a 53% market share and 50% penetration, indicating widespread consumer adoption. Its customers purchase Heinz an average of 2.9 times per annum, contributing to a total of 4 annual purchases of any tomato sauce. In contrast, Daddies sauce holds a 4% market share and 5% penetration, with consumers buying it twice annually, and a higher overall frequency of 6 annual tomato sauce purchases. C&B sauce has the smallest market presence at 1% share and 2% penetration, yet its consumers exhibit the highest frequency of buying any tomato sauce at 8 times per annum, with individual C&B purchases averaging 1.2 times. The structure is comparative, highlighting key performance indicators across different brands.

Therefore, larger brands have more 100% loyal buyers partly because they have a lot of very light category buyers who haven’t made many purchases during the analysis period.

If we use a longer analysis period, the proportion of 100% loyal buyers always declines. Give people sufficient time to make multiple purchases and they will buy more brands.

Loyalty certainly exists, but it is tempered by opportunity. People who buy from a category less often have less opportunity to be disloyal. Similarly, people who shop from stores that stock few brands also appear more loyal (e.g. people who live in smaller towns).

# Prosaic, not passionate, loyalty

So this is the everyday story of loyalty that we gain from observing people’s real buying behaviour over time.<sup>45</sup> In the real world loyalty is everywhere, and every brand has some, but loyalty is divided and strongly driven by opportunity.
