Consequently, Colgate’s fictional Insights Director is jumping at shadows, and overly worrying Margaret. Colgate’s loyalty metrics, both attitudinal and behavioural, are normal for a brand with half the market share of Crest. Indeed all the other research findings are essentially repeating the findings of the first graph (Figure 1.1), that is, that Colgate is half the size of Crest in this market. These metrics don’t show why it is half the size; they are what they are because of Colgate’s size. All will be explained in the forthcoming chapters (if you can’t wait, turn to the end of the book for a list of laws including those that relate to this Colgate case study)

*Note: this case study could have been written from the Crest (Procter & Gamble) perspective, where the danger would be in patting oneself on the back for having such a ‘strong’ brand with highly loyal buyers. Brand equity consultancies make money flattering owners of large market share brands that they are not just large but also strong with attitudinally committed consumers.*

# Are marketers bleeding the companies that employ them?

I am in awe of the modern market economy and the diversity and quality of products that marketers deliver. This modern economy is the product of one of the most incredible social experiments: in the twentieth century classical, planned economies were tried alongside market economies (Hunt & Morgan 1995). The results were startling. Market economies won by a mile, as they provide people with more choice, fewer queues, and better, cheaper products and services³. For example, within a few hundred metres of where I am sitting I have a choice of multiple grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, cafes, wine stores, even several fine chocolate shops. Not bad!

Once when I was in Thailand my charming host Professor Tasman Smith asked if we had many Thai restaurants back home in Adelaide, Australia. I did a quick mental count and tactlessly replied, “Yes, there are four within a short walk from our house”. My faux pas illustrates the fact that those who live in developed market economies are spoilt for choice – we can eat pizza in Thailand, or order a curry in Paris, if we want to. This is because today’s marketers do an amazing job of getting attractive goods to market.

Yet marketing is far from perfect; there is much waste. This matters because marketing activities consume a vast amount of our time.
