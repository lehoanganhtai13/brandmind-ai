# How Do Brands Grow?

What is the secret key to growth? All the global market research agencies claim to provide an exclusive service that can tell if your brand is heading up or down. Every strategy consultancy says that only it can take you on the path to profitable share growth. Econometric modellers say they can quantify precisely which marketing mix will deliver maximum growth. This is all nonsense. If growth were that easy then all marketing directors would be out of a job, or paid a pittance of their current salary. No one can guarantee growth.  
That said, this book does reveal a great deal about how brands grow. Marketing science has been chipping away at the problem for decades. There have already been some breakthroughs that every professional marketing person should know about.  

## The desire for growth  

Have you ever met a marketer who was not interested in sales growth or, at the very least, interested in preventing losses? Growth is an ingrained part of our business culture. Marketing departments are expected to plan for and deliver growth. Marketing initiatives have to be justified in terms of growth potential. The main reason for this obsession with growth is the substantial fixed costs of most firms; this means that companies experience dramatic increases in profitability if they increase sales, and profits can be wiped out by comparatively small sales losses. So growth is very attractive.  
However, market share growth is difficult. Markets are more competitive than ever. Marketers have to work very hard just to retain their current market share position; run very fast just to stand still. For example, the scope for price promotions to deliver any more growth is limited by the fact that we are running about as many promotions as the retail system can handle.
