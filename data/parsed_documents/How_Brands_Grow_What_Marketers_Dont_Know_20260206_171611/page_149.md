That is, people who buy in any price tier will also buy in other price tiers, in line with how big those other price tiers are.

This data presents a comparative analysis of buyer segments across different price tiers, illustrating their purchasing behavior. The primary buyer groups are categorized by their general price perception: Below average, Cheap, Expensive, and Above average, with an overall Average buyer group also included. Each buyer group's overall market share is indicated, alongside the percentage of buyers within that group who also purchase products in other specific price tiers, denoted by '-', '—', '++', and '+'. For instance, 35% of buyers perceive products as "Below average" and within this segment, 64% also purchase "—" tier products, 57% purchase "++" tier products, and 36% purchase "+" tier products. Conversely, the "Cheap" buyer segment, representing 31% of the market, shows 69% also buying "-" tier products, 51% buying "++" tier products, and 30% buying "+" tier products. The "Expensive" segment (27% share) exhibits 66% purchasing "-" tier products, 55% purchasing "—" tier products, and 39% purchasing "+" tier products. Finally, the "Above average" segment (7% share) shows 78% purchasing "-" tier products, 61% purchasing "—" tier products, and 73% purchasing "++" tier products. The "Average" buyer group, with a 25% share, demonstrates a consistent tendency to purchase across all other tiers, with 71% buying "-", 60% buying "—", 60% buying "++", and 35% buying "+". This structure highlights cross-purchasing patterns and the overlap in consumer preferences across distinct price categories.

What this means is that if you manage a ‘low price’ brand, the people who buy it aren’t dedicated to only purchasing lower priced brands; many of your sales actually come from people who normally buy mid-range and premium brands, and who sometimes buy a cheap one. The same is true for premium brands – many sales actually come from the ‘low price’ buyers who occasionally buy a higher priced brand. So in any particular market, there are consumers who habitually buy a range of brands and pay a range of prices. It is therefore hard to successfully target an exclusively ‘low price buyer’ segment with price promotions, because such a segment doesn’t usually exist.

# Why do managers run price promotions?

According to marketing texts, brand managers should build and manage brands by following these steps:

1. assess customer needs and the competitive situation  
2. construct an offering and brand positioning that will resonate with buyers  
3. set a price that reflects the value of the brand to the buyer.

What happens in practice is that brands are routinely discounted below their normal price to generate a short-term increase in sales. Sometimes more than half a brand’s sales are made at the discounted price. This raises the question of which of the two price levels is the normal price for the brand?

What is the purpose of generating these short-term sales spikes? In many cases they do not deliver extra profit, because the margin given away on sales would have been made anyway, at full price.
