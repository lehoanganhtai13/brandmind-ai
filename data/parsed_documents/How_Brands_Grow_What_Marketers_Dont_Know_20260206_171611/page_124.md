> “we [Millward Brown] find in the BrandZ database, which contains information on over 6,000 brands collected over 10 years from category buyers around the world - on average, the proportion of people willing to endorse any brand as ‘different from other brands of (a specific category)’ is low”. - Nigel Hollis, 2011.

Nigel goes on to write that perceived differentiation is higher among people for whom the brand is acceptable (presumably that means they buy it):  
“Among those that consider a brand acceptable, an average of 18 percent agreed that it was different from others, with a range of endorsement from 0 to 86 percent.”

Yes, that’s right, Millward Brown data shows that the low level of differentiation is higher amongst these people, that is, it leaps to a massive 18%. Or put another way, on average 82% of people who find the brand acceptable to buy will NOT endorse that it is “different from other brands in the category”. For the technically minded, that average of 18% is based on a skewed distribution. A few brands score quite high (e.g. expensive, high quality brands or very cheap poor quality brands), but most will be less than the average. That is, for almost all brands in the BrandZ database the vast majority of their customers do not see them as different.

This is a perfect replication of our findings, by an independent group of researchers – very independent given their a strong record of promoting the gospel of differentiation.

*The empirical data is clear, most of the successful brands in the world have very low perceived differentiation, yet they have loyal customers, they earn profits, and many of them have done so for many decades. And will continue to do so, and with low perceived differentiation.* Recently, it has been suggested that awareness and salience play a greater role in buyer behaviour and how brands compete than current differentiation theory would suggest (Ehrenberg, Barnard & Scriven 1997; Romaniuk & Sharp 2004a&b).
