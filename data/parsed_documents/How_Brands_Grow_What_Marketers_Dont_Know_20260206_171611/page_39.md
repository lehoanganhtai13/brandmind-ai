# How To Grow Your Customer Base

Byron Sharp

## What happens when brands grow or decline?

The double jeopardy law tells us that when brands improve their market share their buyer base enlarges. This growth in customer numbers could be due to improvements in customer acquisition, but it could also be the result of reduced customer defection. It’s a fact of marketing life that each year you lose buyers. If a brand can improve its retention levels then it should grow its customer base.

So in theory it’s possible to grow your customer base by improving either retention or acquisition, or a combination of both. We’d expect that making customers more satisfied might bring about both, especially retention. There is now a large body of literature based on this assumption – in fact one could say that the marketing literature for more than a decade has championed retention management.

This raises the strategic question of whether marketers should emphasise retention or acquisition. Modern marketing ideology says retention is cheaper than acquisition. But is it? And what returns are possible? How much emphasis should be placed on retention versus acquisition?

## Is retention cheaper?

A widely read Harvard Business Review article by Reichheld and Sasser (1990) states that customer defections can have a “surprisingly powerful impact on the bottom line … companies can boost profits by almost 100% by retaining just 5% more of their customers”. This is a surprising, fantastic claim, and it turns out to be just that – pure fantasy.
