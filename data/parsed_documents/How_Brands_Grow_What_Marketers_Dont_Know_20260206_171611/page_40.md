It’s reasonably presumed that this claim is based on empirical research, but Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) statement is merely based on a thought experiment; and it goes like this:

> **Suppose a credit card company loses 10% of its customers each year, then the average customer life would be 10 years. Now if that firm were able to reduce its annual customer defection to 5% then the average customer tenure would double to 20 years. Given that a customer delivers some profits each year, now they stay for more years they must each give more.**

This is an analytical tautological ‘finding’, not a real-world discovery based on observing the results of retention efforts. It’s similar to saying that if you win the lottery then you will be richer: true by definition and hardly surprising.

Reichheld and Sasser (1990) presented their logic in a misleading manner because:

* Their fictional 5% drop in defection is actually a drop of 5 percentage points, i.e. from 10% to 5%, which is a 50% decrease; a halving of customer defection (doubling of loyalty).[^17]
* Their thought experiment wasn’t about company profitability, it was about ‘customer profitability’, which is different (it’s a rather theoretical accounting concept). Essentially all they revealed is that if a customer stays (i.e. buys) for longer, then they give you more money over this longer period.

Given that Reichheld and Sasser’s (1990) article was about profitability we might expect that they would have included some assumptions about costs, and they did – they assumed that the halving of defection is achieved at zero cost!

And finally they assumed that halving customer defection in the real world is perfectly possible. Indeed, why stop at half? Their article was titled “Zero defections …” Can companies radically alter their rate of customer defection? Is it possible to reduce defections to zero, or even to halve defections? Empirical evidence shows that this is wishful fantasy.

# Customer defection rates follow double jeopardy

No doubt you have heard the old maxim that it costs five times as much to win a new customer as it does to stop one leaving. There is no empirical support for this idea. In reality, permanently reducing defection rates is difficult and expensive, because defection rates (another loyalty measure) also follow the double jeopardy law.
