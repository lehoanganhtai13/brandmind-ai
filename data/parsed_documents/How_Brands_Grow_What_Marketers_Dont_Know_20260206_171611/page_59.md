Put another way, changes in sales come from buying propensities changing across the entire market – from heavy to light and non-buyers of the brand. Every buyer group (or weight) changes<sup>25</sup>. When marketing is successful in delivering more sales and market share, it does so by giving the brand more heavy buyers, more medium buyers and a lot more light buyers. This means that for maintenance or growth, a brand’s marketing has to somehow, at least over time, reach all the buyers in a category.

Even if a brand gained 100% market share, which would mean it had 100% penetration and perfect loyalty, it would still have many light buyers because category buying also shows a skewed distribution. For example, Figure 4.4 shows the distribution of buying for the toothpaste category - one where we would hope there was rather regular buying. Yet is seems rather rare for a UK household to buy toothpaste more than six times a year. Most bought three times or less, indeed 11% did not buy toothpaste that year.

This data presents a comparative analysis of buyer distribution based on the number of purchases made. The structure is a direct mapping, showing the percentage of buyers corresponding to each purchase quantity. A significant portion of buyers, 11%, made zero purchases, while 18% made a single purchase, representing the largest individual segments. As the number of purchases increases, the percentage of buyers generally decreases, with a notable drop after the first purchase. For instance, 14% of buyers made two purchases, and this figure steadily declines to 1% for buyers making between 12 and 15 purchases. The data indicates a sharp decrease in buyer participation beyond a certain threshold, with very few buyers making a high volume of purchases, and a small fraction (1%) making 20 or more purchases.

Of course, for an individual toothpaste brand these figures are even lighter, less frequent, because a brand’s uses also buy other brands. See Figure 4.5 which shows the buying distribution for Colgate in the same market in the same year. Now 86% of shoppers bought three times or less, with 59% not buying Colgate that year.
