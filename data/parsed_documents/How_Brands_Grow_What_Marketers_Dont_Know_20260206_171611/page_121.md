There were some systematic deviations from this general pattern, where brands consistently obtained higher response levels. This was for small, higher-priced brands. This is consistent with the notion that more differentiated brands will be smaller, or, less popular brands are seen to be different. There were also some brand-specific deviations; however, these tended to be linked to large functional differences and less to image differentiation. So the majority of buyers do not explicitly state that they perceive their brand to be differentiated from other brands. Therefore, it is questionable whether perceptions of brand differentiation drive buyer behaviour. Buyers don’t need to see differentiation to buy a brand, or to keep on buying it.

**Table 8.3:** Examples of category level results

This data presents a comparative analysis of consumer perception across various product categories, specifically focusing on how current users perceive differences and uniqueness. The categories are evaluated based on the percentage of users who believe the category is different, unique, or either different or unique. Spirits show the highest perception of difference (20%) and uniqueness (27%), leading to the highest combined perception of 36%. Conversely, Electronics and Water exhibit lower perception rates across all metrics, with Electronics at 4% for difference and 6% for uniqueness, and Water at 6% for both. Other categories like Supermarkets, Skincare, and F&V drinks fall in the mid-range, with varying degrees of perceived difference and uniqueness. The overall average across all categories indicates a moderate level of perceived distinction, with 11% of users seeing categories as different, 10% as unique, and 17% as either.

Table 8.4 – showing some of the brand-level data from the information technology category in Table 8.3 – illustrates this with the example of Apple, a poster child for differentiation and customer loyalty (as discussed in Chapter 7). Apple’s level of perceived differentiation is higher than other computer brands, but it is not high.
