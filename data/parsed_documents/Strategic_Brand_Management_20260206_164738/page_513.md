fueled by worldwide exposure to movies, television, and other media than ever before. One result is that brands able to tap into the global sensibilities of the youth market may be better prepared to adopt a standardized branding program and marketing strategy. Unilever uses a standard approach to market its Axe Body Spray globally based on sex appeal.

Marketers are also considering how various ethnic, racial, or cultural groups may require different marketing programs. In 2010, Hispanics accounted for 50.5 million of the 308 million people in the United States and about $1 trillion in annual purchasing power. Established television networks such as Univision and Telemundo and targeted radio, newspapers, and magazines help marketers reach Hispanics with ads. Active online, the Hispanic market also has a higher smartphone penetration than the general population.

Various firms have created specialized marketing programs with different products, advertising, promotions, and so on to better reach and persuade this market. Olive Garden Italian Restaurant chain spends 10 percent of its $150 million overall ad budget on Hispanic market television. Southwest Airlines communicates in “Spanglish”—a mixture of Spanish and English—in some ads. JC Penney’s Hispanic team is made up of marketing, merchandising, planning, real estate, and store operations. The company may stock smaller sizes in stores with larger Hispanic customer bases and observe Mexican holidays (Mother’s Day is on a different day than in the United States, for instance).

The Asian population is also growing faster than the total population and is comparatively younger and better educated. Asian buying power is expected to grow by 42 percent in the coming years, from $544 billion in 2010 to $775 billion in 2015. Bank of America prospered by targeting Asians in San Francisco with separate TV campaigns aimed at Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese customers. Branding Brief 14-1 describes marketing efforts to build brand equity with African Americans.

Marketing critics say that some consumers may not like being targeted on the basis of their being different, since that only reinforces their image as outsiders or a minority. Moreover, consumers not in the targeted segment may feel alienated or distanced from the company and brand as a result. Companies like Ford, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble that sell to a broad range of consumers are embracing diverse racial and ethnic markets in a natural, organic way, and they are seeing sales spikes among minority groups. In a different strategy, Burger King and Home Depot consolidated all their advertising with their general market agencies, believing there was no need to have separate agencies specializing in targeting particular minority groups; these consumers were being adequately included in their deliberately inclusive general market campaigns.

# RATIONALE FOR GOING INTERNATIONAL

A number of well-known global brands have derived much of their sales and profits from non-domestic markets for decades, including Coca-Cola, Shell, Bayer, Rolex, Marlboro, Pampers, and Mercedes-Benz, to name a few. Apple computers, L’Oréal cosmetics, and Nescafé instant coffee have become fixtures on the global landscape. Their successes are among the forces that have encouraged many firms to market their brands internationally, including the following:

* Perception of slow growth and increased competition in domestic markets  
* Belief in enhanced overseas growth and profit opportunities  
* Desire to reduce costs from economies of scale  
* Need to diversify risk  
* Recognition of global mobility of customers  

In more product categories, the ability to establish a global profile is becoming a prerequisite for success. For example, in luxury goods such as jewelry, watches, and handbags, where the addressable market is a relatively small percentage of the global market, a global profile is necessary to grow profitably. Ideally, the marketing program for a global brand consists of one product formulation, one package design, one advertising program, one pricing schedule, one distribution plan, and so on that would prove the most effective and efficient option for every country in which the brand was sold. Unfortunately, such a uniformly optimal strategy is rarely possible. Consider how the Oreo brand has evolved globally.
