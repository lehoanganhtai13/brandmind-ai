* How to adjust branding strategies over time and across geographic boundaries to maximize brand equity  

## WHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BOOK?  
My objective in writing this book was to satisfy three key criteria by which any marketing text should be judged:  
* *Depth:* The material in the book had to be presented in the context of conceptual frameworks that were comprehensive, internally consistent and cohesive, and well grounded in the academic and practitioner literature.  
* *Breadth:* The book had to cover all those topics that practicing managers and students of brand management found intriguing and/or important.  
* *Relevance:* Finally, the book had to be well grounded in practice and easily related to past and present marketing activities, events, and case studies.  

Although a number of excellent books have been written about brands, no book has really maximized those three dimensions to the greatest possible extent. This book sets out to fill that gap by accomplishing three things.  

First, we develop our main framework that provides a definition of brand equity, identifies sources and outcomes of brand equity, and provides tactical guidelines about how to build, measure, and manage brand equity. Recognizing the general importance of consumers and customers to marketing—understanding and satisfying their needs and wants—this broad framework approaches branding from the perspective of the consumer; it is called *customer-based brand equity*. We then introduce a number of more specific frameworks to provide more detailed guidance.  

Second, besides these broad, fundamentally important branding topics, for completeness, numerous Science of Branding boxes provide in-depth treatment of cutting-edge ideas and concepts, and each chapter contains a Brand Focus appendix that delves into detail on specific, related branding topics, such as brand audits, legal issues, brand crises, and private labels.  

Finally, to maximize relevance, numerous in-text examples illuminate the discussion of virtually every topic, and a series of Branding Brief boxes provide more in-depth examinations of selected topics or brands.  

Thus, this book can help readers understand the important issues in planning and evaluating brand strategies, as well as providing appropriate concepts, theories, and other tools to make better branding decisions. We identify successful and unsuccessful brand marketers—and why they have been so—to offer readers a greater appreciation of the range of issues in branding, as well as a means to organize their own thoughts about those issues.  

## WHO SHOULD READ THE BOOK?  
A wide range of people can benefit from reading this book:  
* Students interested in increasing both their understanding of basic branding principles and their exposure to classic and contemporary branding applications and case studies  
* Managers and analysts concerned with the effects of their day-to-day marketing decisions on brand performance  
* Senior executives concerned with the longer-term prosperity of their brand franchises and product or service portfolios  
* All marketers interested in new ideas with implications for marketing strategies and tactics  

The perspective we adopt is relevant to any type of organization (public or private, large or small), and the examples cover a wide range of industries and geographies. To illuminate branding concepts across different settings, we review specific applications to online, industrial, high-tech, service, retailer, and small business in Chapters 1 and 15.
