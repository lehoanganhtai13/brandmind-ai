**Loyalty Programs.**  
Loyalty or frequency programs have become one popular means by which marketers can create stronger ties to customers.<sup>35</sup> Their purpose is “identifying, maintaining, and increasing the yield from a firm’s ‘best’ customers through long-term, interactive, value-added relationships.”<sup>36</sup> Firms in all kinds of industries—most notably the airlines—have established loyalty programs through different mixtures of specialized services, newsletters, premiums, and incentives. Often they include extensive co-branding arrangements or brand alliances.

### LOYALTY PROGRAMS IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

What started three decades ago in the American market has now become industry standard: airlines around the world offer individual loyalty programs where participants are rewarded for their travel with free flights. The most frequent flyers—the Gold members—get extra perks, such as upgrades and lounge access. Some major airlines have grouped together to form alliances (Star Alliance, One World, and Sky Team) that encourage passengers to enjoy a range of privileges. In Asia, the most prominent programs are Singapore Airlines’ Kris Flyer and Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles. In newly industrialized South Korea, Asiana Airlines offers the Asiana Club, with more than 10 million members; and Korean Air’s SkyPass has more than 13 million members. Although only a small percentage of the members are frequent fliers, the amount of accumulated miles has skyrocketed as a result of customers’ ability to accumulate miles not  only through flights, but also through hotel stays, car rentals, and credit card and mobile phone usage.<sup>37</sup>

Many businesses besides airlines introduced loyalty programs in the intervening years because they often yield results.<sup>38</sup> As one marketing executive said, “Loyalty programs reduce defection rates and increase retention.  
You can win more of a customer’s purchasing share.” The value created by the loyalty program creates switching costs for consumers, reducing price competition among brands.

To get discounts, however, consumers must typically hand over personal data, raising privacy concerns. When the loyalty program is tied into a credit card, as is sometimes the case, privacy concerns are even more acute. Nevertheless, the lure of special deals can be compelling to consumers, and in 2011, there were more than 2 billion memberships in loyalty programs, with an average value of $622 points issues per household. A third of these rewards, however, remain unredeemed.<sup>39</sup>

The appeal to marketers is clear too. Fifteen percent of a retailer’s most loyal customers can account for as much as half its sales, and it can take between 12 and 20 new customers to replace a lost loyal customer.<sup>40</sup> Some tips for building effective loyalty programs follow:<sup>41</sup>

* *Know your audience:* Most loyalty marketers employ sophisticated databases and software to determine which customer segment to target with a given program. Target customers whose purchasing behavior can be changed by the program.  
* *Change is good:* Marketers must constantly update the program to attract new customers and prevent other companies in their category from developing “me-too” programs. “Any loyalty program that stays static will die,” said one executive.
