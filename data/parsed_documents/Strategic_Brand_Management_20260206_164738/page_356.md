This data visually represents a comparative analysis of "Energized Differentiation" against "Relevance," likely within a business or strategic context. The structure suggests a two-dimensional plot where "Energized Differentiation" is the primary axis, ranging from 0 to 100, and "Relevance" is a secondary, implied axis. The left side of the diagram, labeled "Energized Differentiation > Relevance," indicates scenarios where the level of energized differentiation exceeds its relevance. Conversely, the right side, "Energized Differentiation < Relevance," depicts situations where energized differentiation falls short of its relevance. The numerical scale (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) along the "Energized Differentiation Relevance" axis serves as a quantitative measure, allowing for the plotting of specific points or regions that define the relationship between these two concepts. The presence of "Examples" as a header suggests that specific instances or case studies would be mapped onto this framework to illustrate the different states of energized differentiation relative to relevance.

Brand has captured attention and now has potential to grow and to build Relevance: Brand has momentum

This data visually represents a conceptual framework, likely illustrating a progression or a scoring system related to "Energized Differentiation Relevance." The vertical axis, ranging from 0 to 100, appears to quantify a level or intensity. The horizontal axis is labeled with three distinct stages: "Energized," "Differentiation," and "Relevance," suggesting a sequential or interconnected relationship between these concepts. The absence of data points or specific examples within the table, beyond the axis labels, indicates that this is a structural representation rather than a dataset with empirical values. The overall structure suggests a model where "Energized" might be a foundational state, leading to "Differentiation," which in turn contributes to or is measured by "Relevance," with the numerical scale indicating the degree or success of this process.

Uniqueness has faded, price or convenience has become dominant reason to buy: Brand has lost pricing power

This data visually represents a relationship between "Esteem" and "Knowledge," with a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 100. The scale suggests a potential correlation or progression, where increasing "Knowledge" might be associated with higher levels of "Esteem." The absence of specific data points or examples within the table, beyond the axis labels, limits a detailed analysis of the exact nature of this relationship. However, the structure implies a potential positive correlation, where a higher standing on the "Knowledge" axis corresponds to a higher value on the 0-100 scale, which is then linked to "Esteem." The diagram appears to be a simplified representation, possibly illustrating a theoretical model or a conceptual framework rather than empirical data.

Brand is better liked than known: Desire to find out more

## The Powergrid

BrandAsset® Valuator has integrated the two macro dimensions of Brand Strength (Energized Differentiation and Relevance) and Brand Stature (Esteem and Knowledge) into a visual analytical representation known as the PowerGrid (see Figure 9-16). The PowerGrid depicts the stages in the cycle of brand development—each with its characteristic pillar patterns—in successive quadrants.

Brands generally begin their life in the lower left quadrant, where they first need to develop Relevant Differentiation and establish their reason for being. Most often, the movement from there is “up” into the top left quadrant. Increased Differentiation, followed by Relevance, initiates growth in Brand Strength. These developments occur before the brand has acquired significant Esteem or is widely known.

This quadrant represents two types of brands. For brands destined for a mass target, like Yelp and Kindle, this is the stage of emerging potential. Specialized or narrowly targeted brands, however, tend to remain in this quadrant (when viewed from the perspective of a mass audience) and can use their strength to occupy a profitable niche. This includes brands like Method and W Hotels. From the point of view of brand leaders, new potential competitors will emerge from this quadrant.

The upper right quadrant, the Leadership Quadrant, is populated by brand leaders—those that have high levels of both Brand Strength and Brand Stature. Both older and relatively new brands can be in this quadrant, meaning that brand leadership is truly a function of the pillar measures, not of longevity. When properly managed, a brand can build and maintain a leadership position indefinitely. Examples of brands in the leadership position include Facebook, Levi’s, and Nike.

Although declining brand equity is not inevitable, brands for whom strength has declined (usually driven by declining Energized Differentiation) can also be seen in this same quadrant. Brands whose Strength has started to dip below the level of their Stature display the first signs of weakness, which may well be masked by their still-buoyant sales and wide penetration. Examples include such brands as Macy’s and Visa.

Brands that fail to maintain their Brand Strength—their Relevant Differentiation—begin to fade and move “down” into the bottom right quadrant. These brands become vulnerable not just to existing competitors, but also to the depredations of discount price brands, and they frequently end up being drawn into heavy and continuous price promotion in order to defend their consumer franchise and market share. American Airlines and TV Guide fall into this category.

Significant investigation has been done on relating BAV metrics to financial performance and stock price. First, the position of a brand on the PowerGrid indicates the level of intangible value (market value of brand or company-invested capital) per dollar of sale. The leadership quadrant produces brands with the largest intangible value per dollar of sale. Next, through extensive modeling, BAV has shown that a change in brand assets impacts stock price. From a macro perspective, two-thirds of the change in brand assets directly impacts stock price and the expectation for future returns. One-third of the change in brand assets impacts current earnings. The importance of brand assets on stock price and company valuation is highly dependent on the category or economic sector.
