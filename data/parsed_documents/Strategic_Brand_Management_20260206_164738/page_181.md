The customer-based brand equity model provides some useful guidance to interpret these effects. One implication of the conceptualization of customer-based brand equity is that the *manner* in which brand associations are formed does not matter—only the resulting awareness and strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations.

In other words, if a consumer has an equally strong and favorable brand association from Rolaids antacids to the concept “relief,” whether it’s based on past product experiences, a *Consumer Reports* article, exposure to a “problem-solution” television ad that concludes with the tag line “R-O-L-A-I-D-S spells relief,” or knowledge that Rolaids has sponsored the “Rolaids Relief Man of the Year” award to the best relief pitchers in major league baseball since 1976, the impact in terms of customer-based brand equity should be identical unless additional associations such as “advertised on television” are created, or existing associations such as “speed or potency of effects” are affected in some way.³

Thus, marketers should evaluate *all* possible means to create knowledge, considering not just efficiency and cost but also effectiveness. At the center of all brand-building efforts is the actual product or service. Marketing activities surrounding that product, however, can be critical, as is the way marketers integrate the brand into them.

Consistent with this view, Schultz, Tannenbaum, and Lauterborn conceptualize one aspect of integrated marketing, integrated marketing communications, in terms of contacts.⁴ They define a *contact* as any information-bearing experience that a customer or prospect has with the brand, the product category, or the market that relates to the marketer’s product or service. According to these authors, a person can come in contact with a brand in numerous ways:

> For example, a contact can include friends’ and neighbors’ comments, packaging, newspaper, magazine, and television information, ways the customer or prospect is treated in the retail store, where the product is shelved in the store, and the type of signage that appears in retail establishments. And the contacts do not stop with the purchase. Contacts also consist of what friends, relatives, and bosses say about a person who is using the product. Contacts include the type of customer service given with returns or inquiries, or even the types of letters the company writes to resolve problems or to solicit additional business. All of these are customer contacts with the brand. These bits and pieces of information, experiences, and relationships, created over time, influence the potential relationship among the customer, the brand, and the marketer.

In a similar vein, Chattopadhyay and Laborie develop a methodology for managing brand experience contact points.⁵

The bottom line is that there are many different ways to build brand equity. Unfortunately, there are also many different firms attempting to build their brand equity in the marketplace. Creative and original thinking is necessary to create fresh new marketing programs that break through the noise in the marketplace to connect with customers. Marketers are increasingly trying a host of unconventional means of building brand equity.

### MOOSEJAW MOUNTAINEERING

Targeting a young college-age demographic, offbeat outdoor apparel and gear retailer Moosejaw Mountaineering has found success with a marketing strategy it calls “Love the Madness.” Founded by two former wilderness guides, the company has adopted the motto, “We sell the best outdoor gear in the world and have the most fun doing it.” Selling most major brands of snowboarding, rock climbing, hiking, and camping products—as well as its own private label—through nine stores in Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, and Massachusetts as well as a catalog and Web site, the retailer succeeds because of the way it sells. Virtually any consumer touchpoint with Moosejaw has an irreverent side. As co-founder Robert Wolfe says, “We have the great product, but then we put some stupid little twist to it that makes us stand out from everybody else.” In Moosejaw’s “Operation Sale,” store customers were invited to play the old electronic board game at checkout. Picking up the charley horse without setting off the buzzer brought the customer 20 percent off! The company launched a “Break-Up Service” in which it volunteered to make the difficult call to help customers seeking to end relationships. Text messages from the store offer discounts for replies. One text challenged customers to a digital version of the popular “Rock, Paper, Scissors” game with a 20 percent discount for winners. When the company added a single line to its catalog asking readers to send their best illustration of “crying tomatoes,” 300 people replied. All these different efforts have had a payoff: company market research shows that the 40 percent of customers who can be classified as “highly engaged” with the brand place at least four orders with the company, more than the norm.⁶ Moosejaw Mountaineering’s unconventional branding approach has created much engagement and loyalty with customers.
