# BURTON SNOWBOARDS

The best-known snowboard brand, Burton Snowboards, saw its market share increase from 30 percent to 40 percent by focusing on one objective—providing the best equipment to the largest number of snowboarders. To accomplish this goal, Burton engages in a number of activities. Burton puts much emphasis on its many professional riders worldwide, including a smaller percentage who are on its sponsored team. Staff members talk to the riders—on the slopes or on the phone—almost every day, and riders help to design virtually every Burton product. Company researchers immerse themselves in the riders’ lives, watching where they shop, what they buy, and what they think about the sport and the equipment. To make sure it doesn’t lose touch with its rank-and-file consumers, however, the company makes sure its sales representatives hit the slopes on the weekend to interact with amateur snowboarders. All employees also get a free season pass for the slopes and are allowed to use any new Burton gear for a few days to test and promote it. In 2010, the Burton Demo Tour became the largest consumer interactive product demo in the snowboard world, with over 2,000 riders testing Burton gear on slopes all over North America. Burton also has the eTeam—an online community of 25,000 kids who provide real-time feedback in exchange for free product trials. All of this information is fed into Burton’s state-of-the-art innovation center, “Craig’s,” named after the late snowboarding pioneer Craig Kelly, where advanced prototypes are developed and tested almost daily.³⁶

Compact video cameras make capturing participants’ words and actions easier, and short films are often part of the research output that is reported to help bring the research to life.³⁷ Every research method, however, has its advantages and disadvantages.³⁸ Two of the more significant downsides to ethnographic research are that it is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, because it is based on subjective interpretation, multiple points of view may prevail.

### Summary

Qualitative research techniques are a creative means of ascertaining consumer perceptions that may otherwise be difficult to uncover. The range of possible qualitative research techniques is limited only by the creativity of the marketing researcher.

Qualitative research, however, also has its drawbacks. The in-depth insights that emerge have to be tempered by the realization that the samples are often very small and may not necessarily generalize to broader populations. Moreover, given the qualitative nature of the data, there may be questions of interpretation. Different researchers examining the same results from a qualitative research study may draw different conclusions.

# QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

Although qualitative measures are useful in identifying the range of possible associations with a brand and some initial insights into their strength, favorability, and uniqueness, marketers often want a more definitive portrait of the brand to allow them to make more confident and defensible strategic and tactical recommendations.
