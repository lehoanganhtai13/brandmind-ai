Sriram, Balachandar, and Kalwani similarly use store-level scanner data to track brand equity and key drivers of brand equity over time.²¹

### Choice Experiments.  
Swait, Erdem, and colleagues have proposed a related approach to measuring brand equity with choice experiments that account for brand names, product attributes, brand image, and differences in consumer sociodemographic characteristics and brand usage.²² They define the *equalization price* as the price that equates the utility of a brand to the utilities that could be attributed to a brand in the category where no brand differentiation occurred. We can consider equalization price a proxy for brand equity.²³

### Multi-Attribute Attitude Models.  
Srinivasan, Park, and Chang have proposed a comprehensive residual methodology to measure brand equity based on the multiattribute attitude model.²⁴ Their approach reveals the relative sizes of different bases of brand equity by dividing brand equity into three components: brand awareness, attribute perception biases, and nonattribute preference.

* The *attribute-perception biased component* of brand equity is the difference between subjectively perceived attribute values and objectively measured attribute values. Objectively measured attribute values come from independent testing services such as *Consumer Reports* or acknowledged experts in the field.  
* The *nonattribute preference component* of brand equity is the difference between subjectively perceived attribute values and overall preference. It reflects the consumer’s overall appraisal of a brand that goes beyond the utility of individual product attributes.

The researchers also incorporate the effects of enhancing brand awareness and preference on consumer “pull” and the brand’s availability. They propose a survey procedure to collect information for estimating these different perception and preference measures.  
Dillon and his colleagues have presented a model for decomposing attribute ratings of a brand into two components: (1) brand-specific associations, meaning features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand; and (2) general brand impressions based on a more holistic view of a brand.²⁵

### Critique.  
Residual approaches provide a useful benchmark for interpreting brand equity, especially when we need approximations of brand equity or a financially oriented perspective on it. The disadvantage of residual approaches is that they are most appropriate for brands with a lot of product-related attribute associations, because these measures are unable to distinguish between different types of non-product-related attribute associations. Consequently, the residual approach’s diagnostic value for strategic decision making in other cases is limited.

More generally, residual approaches take a fairly static view of brand equity by focusing on consumer *preferences*. This contrasts sharply with the process view advocated by the customer-based brand equity framework. The brand-based and marketing-based comparative approaches stress looking at consumer *response* to the marketing of a brand and attempting to uncover the extent to which that response is affected by brand knowledge.

This distinction is also relevant for the issue of “separability” in brand valuation that various researchers have raised. For example, Barwise and his colleagues note that marketing efforts to create an extended or augmented product, say, with extra features or service plus other means to enhance brand value, “raise serious problems of separating the value of the brand name and trademark from the many other elements of the ‘augmented’ product.”²⁶ According to customer-based brand equity, those efforts could affect the favorability, strength, and uniqueness of various brand associations, which would, in turn, affect consumer response to *future* marketing activities.

For example, imagine that a brand becomes known for providing extraordinary customer service because of certain policies and favorable advertising, publicity, or word-of-mouth (like Nordstrom department stores or Singapore Airlines). These favorable perceptions of customer service and the attitudes they engender could create customer-based brand equity by affecting consumer response to a price policy (consumers would be willing to pay higher prices), a new ad campaign (consumers would accept an ad illustrating customer satisfaction), or a brand extension (customers would become interested in trying a new type of retail outlet).
