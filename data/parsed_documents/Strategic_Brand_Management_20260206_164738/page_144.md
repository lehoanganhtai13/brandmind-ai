# Memorability, Meaningfulness, and Likability

The latter three, however, play a defensive role for leveraging and maintaining brand equity in the face of different opportunities and constraints. Let’s consider each of these general criteria.

## Memorability
A necessary condition for building brand equity is achieving a high level of brand awareness. Brand elements that promote that goal are inherently memorable and attention-getting and therefore facilitate recall or recognition in purchase or consumption settings. For example, a brand of propane gas cylinders named Blue Rhino featuring a powder-blue animal mascot with a distinctive yellow flame is likely to stick in the minds of consumers.

## Meaningfulness
Brand elements may take on all kinds of meaning, with either descriptive or persuasive content. We saw in Chapter 1 that brand names can be based on people, places, animals or birds, or other things or objects. Two particularly important criteria are how well the brand element conveys the following:

* *General information about the function of the product or service:* Does the brand element have descriptive meaning and suggest something about the product category, the needs satisfied or benefits supplied? How likely is it that a consumer could correctly identify the product category for the brand based on any one brand element? Does the brand element seem credible in the product category?
* *Specific information about particular attributes and benefits of the brand:* Does the brand element have persuasive meaning and suggest something about the particular kind of product, or its key points-of-difference attributes or benefits? Does it suggest something about some aspect of the product performance or the type of person who might use the brand?

The first dimension is an important determinant of brand awareness and salience; the second, of brand image and positioning.

## Likability
Independent of its memorability and meaningfulness, do customers find the brand element aesthetically appealing? Is it likable visually, verbally, and in other ways? Brand elements can be rich in imagery and inherently fun and interesting, even if not always directly related to the product.

A memorable, meaningful, and likable set of brand elements offers many advantages because consumers often do not examine much information in making product decisions. Descriptive and persuasive elements reduce the burden on marketing communications to build awareness and link brand associations and equity, especially when few other product-related associations exist. Often, the less concrete the possible product benefits are, the more important is the creative potential of the brand name and other brand elements to capture intangible characteristics of a brand.

## KFC
KFC is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain, and there is no doubt that KFC’s success can be partly attributed to a powerful set of memorable, meaningful, and likable brand elements. The brand name itself is indicative as to what the brand is offering: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Originating in the 1950s, KFC’s “finger lickin’ good” slogan has resonated with families worldwide for over 50 years, along with its distinctive packaging, including the paper bucket with red and white coloring. KFC’s pioneer, Colonel Harland Sanders, remains a key character and symbol in KFC’s advertising, packaging, and branding. “The Colonel” is one of the most recognized, respected, and beloved brand icons to ever exist. Aside from slight changes to his attire, he continues to remind customers of the tasty, high-quality, fresh chicken with the 11 secret herbs and spices that he began making more than 50 years ago. KFC’s official URL is kfc.com, which includes more than 30 international Web sites covering the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
