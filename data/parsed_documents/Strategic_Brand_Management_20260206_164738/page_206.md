## Direct Channels

For some of the reasons we’ve already noted, manufacturers may choose to sell directly to consumers. Let’s examine some of the brand equity issues of selling through direct channels.

### Company-Owned Stores.

To gain control over the selling process and build stronger relationships with customers, some manufacturers are introducing their own retail outlets, as well as selling their product directly to customers through various means. These channels can take many forms, the most complex of which, from a manufacturer’s perspective, is company-owned stores. Hallmark, Goodyear, and others have sold their own products in their own stores for years. They have eventually been joined by a number of other firms—including some of the biggest marketers around.

For example, in December 1994, after the Federal Trade Commission amended a 16-year ban on the jeans maker selling its own wares, Levi Strauss began to open up Levi’s Stores in the United States and abroad, located mostly in downtown areas and upscale suburban malls.[82] Only launched in 2001, Apple now derives 20 percent of its revenue from its physical stores, generating revenue at a rate of about $4,000 per square foot a year. Apple’s own-store success is attributed to strong customer service, a clear link between the retail space and the product’s user-friendly design, and the “community center” environment that add up to create a distinctively Apple retail experience.[83]

A number of other brands of all kinds have created their own stores, such as Bang & Olufsen audio equipment, OshKosh B’Gosh children’s wear, Dr. Martens boots and shoes, and Warner Bros. entertainment. But not all company stores are big structures with extensive inventory. One recent trend is the launching of pop-up stores—temporary stores that blend retail and event marketing.[84]

## POP-UP STORES

As a means to complement their existing channels and even own brick-and-mortar stores, some companies are introducing temporary store locations, especially during the holiday season. One popular location is New York City, which at times can have many appealing vacant spaces to choose from. During the 2010 holiday season, Procter & Gamble’s 4,000-square-foot pop-up location on Fifty-Seventh Street in Manhattan drew 14,000 visitors in the first 10 days it was open. P&G’s store, with tinted windows and neon lights, was designed as a flashy means to distribute samples of its products and experiences—from a full CoverGirl makeover or Head & Shoulders wash-and-blow-dry to free Febreze scented candles. Levi Strauss’s 10,000-square-foot “workshop” in a former art gallery in Manhattan’s SoHo district was designed to reinforce craftsmanship and collaboration themes in its “Go Forth” ad campaign. Target’s Liberty of London pop-up shop closed a day early when it sold out of all its merchandise. For all these companies, pop-up stores are a way to create buzz, try out some new products and merchandising, and connect with some consumers in a unique way.
