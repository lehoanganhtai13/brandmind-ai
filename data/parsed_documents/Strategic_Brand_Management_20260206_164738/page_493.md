# BRANDING BRIEF 13-2

## Remaking Burberry’s Image

Burberry, founded in 1856 by 21-year-old Thomas Burberry, was a veritable “fashion disaster” in the mid-1990s. It was known to many as a stodgy throwback brand making raincoats for the middle-aged, “far off the radar screens of the fashion world.” Yet within a span of several years, with the help of contemporary designs and updated marketing, the brand shrugged off its staid image and became fashionable again. The company instituted a new motto—“Never stop designing”—that encapsulated its new approach to establishing and maintaining relevance with the fickle fashion consumer.

One of Burberry’s first moves to freshen the brand was to leverage its classic beige-check plaid in a series of accessories that quickly became best-sellers, including handbags, scarves, and headbands. Another was rejuvenating the check itself by using different colors, patterns, sizes, and materials. Burberry was careful to maintain a balance between the contemporary and the traditional, since tradition still resonated with modern consumers. It also sought to leverage other iconic imagery, such as the trench coat and the Prorsum horse insignia. The use of these brand icons reflected management’s belief that “the core ethos and aesthetics of the brand were relevant today because of Thomas Burberry’s ingenuity and creativity.”

Another key to Burberry’s turnaround was refreshing its advertising. The company hired famed fashion photographer Mario Testino to shoot a spread featuring edgy supermodels, such as Kate Moss, wearing iconic Burberry raincoats. The ads were credited with bringing a “rebellious, streetwise image to the brand.” The company gave its retail stores a makeover as well in order to match the contemporary feel of the new designs.

Together, these different efforts turned the company’s fortunes around—but almost too well. One of the challenges in any brand revitalization is sustaining momentum, and Burberry was no exception. After peaking in 2002 with a successful IPO, the brand began to suffer from overexposure and a slew of counterfeit products. Following a holiday sales slump in 2004, the company knew it had to set a different course.

A number of marketing changes were implemented. The trademark tan/black/white/red Burberry plaid was dialed down and made more discreet, appearing on only 10% of the brand’s different items. More emphasis was placed on high-margin accessories—non-apparel accounts for one-third of revenue—and high-end fashions. The pricey Prorsum collections made up only 5 percent of the brand’s sales, but they became the label’s fashion flag-bearer and source of creative credibility.

Benefiting from vibrant emerging markets such as China, a constantly updated new product pipeline, and one of the most advanced digital strategies of any luxury brand, Burberry found itself in 2011 with annual revenues over $2 billion, far exceeding financial forecasts.

In other cases, however, the old positioning is just no longer viable and reinvention is necessary. Mountain Dew completely overhauled its brand image to become a soft drink powerhouse. As Branding Brief 13-4 illustrates, it is often easiest to revive a brand that has simply been forgotten.

Revitalization strategies obviously run along a continuum, with pure back-to-basics at one end and pure reinvention at the other. Many campaigns combine elements of both.
