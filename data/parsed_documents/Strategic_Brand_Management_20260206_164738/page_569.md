# BRAND FOCUS 15.0

## Special Applications

In Chapter 1, we deliberately defined *product* as encompassing not only physical goods but also services, retail stores, people, organizations, places, and ideas. While the themes and guidelines for building, measuring, and managing brand equity that we’ve presented are appropriate for virtually all types of products, here we’ll consider in greater detail some specific issues for some less conventional types of products—online brands, industrial and business-to-business products, high-technology products, services, retailers, and small businesses.

### Online

Creating a brand online brings a special set of challenges. Many of the guidelines for business-to-business, high-tech, retailing, and small businesses identified below will apply, but a few others are worth reinforcing (as summarized in Figure 15-10).

*Don’t forget the brand-building basics.* Remember brand-building basics such as establishing points-of-parity (convenience, price, and variety) and points-of-difference (customer service, credibility, and personality). As we noted in earlier chapters, one mistake of many failed dot-com brands was being impatient to build their brands and failing to build from the bottom up.

In research undertaken to understand *online service quality*, defined as the extent to which a Web site facilitates efficient and effective shopping, purchasing, and delivery, one study identified 11 dimensions of perceived e-service quality: access, ease of navigation, efficiency, flexibility, reliability, personalization, security/privacy, responsiveness, assurance/trust, site aesthetics, and price knowledge.  
Land’s End became a top-selling company online by treating its Internet operations as a digital translation of its successful catalog, ensuring that merchandise was presented properly and excellent customer service prevailed.

**Create strong brand identity.** Given that consumers aren’t physically confronted by brands online as they are in a store, brand awareness and recall are critical. Choosing the best URL and devising an effective search term strategy are therefore critical. Keep the basic brand element criteria in mind, perhaps with greater emphasis on brand recall as an objective (1-800-FLOWERS took its brand directly to the Web). A simple but evocative name can also be useful, like BabyCenter.com, an information and commerce Web site providing content on pregnancy and babies, an interactive community for parents and parents-to-be, and a store featuring thousands of baby products and supplies.

**Generate strong consumer pull.** An important lesson for online brands was the need to create demand off-line in order to drive consumers online. Online marketers must introduce the best possible integrated marketing communication program, using sampling and other trial devices as well as social media; public relations; sponsorships; and television, radio, and print advertising.

**Selectively choose brand partnerships.** Brand partnerships that satisfy brand-building and profit criteria can drive traffic, signal credibility, and help enhance image. In Australia, Seniors Club Online, which caters to consumers aged 60-plus with various entertainment and promotional offers, partnered with *Reader’s Digest* magazine to offer free issues.

**Maximize relationship marketing.** Finally, to leverage the advantages of customization and interactivity, marketers must engage in one-to-one, participatory, experiential, and other forms of relationship marketing. Creating a strong online brand community between the consumer and the brand, as well as with other consumers, through blogs, online contests, and social media can help achieve brand resonance. Online brands can offer much potentially relevant customer information; for example,

Figure 15-10 outlines five additional guidelines for online brands, emphasizing foundational brand-building principles alongside strategic relationship and partnership management. The guidelines suggest maintaining core brand-building basics while actively cultivating a strong brand identity and generating consumer pull. Furthermore, the figure highlights the importance of judiciously selecting brand partnerships and maximizing relationship marketing efforts to enhance the brand's online presence and effectiveness. This framework presents a comparative approach, offering distinct yet interconnected strategies for online brand success. 1.
