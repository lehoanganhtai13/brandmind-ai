Researchers have classified products and their associated attributes or benefits into three major categories: search goods, experience goods, and credence goods.¹¹

* For *search goods* like grocery produce, consumers can evaluate product attributes like sturdiness, size, color, style, design, weight, and ingredient composition by visual inspection.
* For *experience goods* like automobile tires, consumers cannot assess product attributes like durability, service quality, safety, and ease of handling or use so easily by inspection, and actual product trial and experience is necessary.
* For *credence goods* like insurance coverage, consumers may rarely learn product attributes.

Given the difficulty of assessing and interpreting product attributes and benefits for experience and credence goods, brands may be particularly important signals of quality and other characteristics to consumers for these types of products.¹²

Brands can reduce the risks in product decisions. Consumers may perceive many different types of risks in buying and consuming a product:¹³

* *Functional risk*: The product does not perform up to expectations.
* *Physical risk*: The product poses a threat to the physical well-being or health of the user or others.
* *Financial risk*: The product is not worth the price paid.
* *Social risk*: The product results in embarrassment from others.
* *Psychological risk*: The product affects the mental well-being of the user.
* *Time risk*: The failure of the product results in an opportunity cost of finding another satisfactory product.

Consumers can certainly handle these risks in a number of ways, but one way is obviously to buy well-known brands, especially those with which consumers have had favorable past experiences. Thus, brands can be a very important risk-handling device, especially in business-to-business settings where risks can sometimes have quite profound implications.

In summary, to consumers, the special meaning that brands take on can change their perceptions and experiences with a product. The identical product may be evaluated differently depending on the brand identification or attribution it carries. Brands take on unique, personal meanings to consumers that facilitate their day-to-day activities and enrich their lives. As consumers’ lives become more complicated, rushed, and time starved, the ability of a brand to simplify decision making and reduce risk is invaluable.

### Firms

Brands also provide a number of valuable functions to their firms.¹⁴ Fundamentally, they serve an identification purpose, to simplify product handling or tracing. Operationally, brands help organize inventory and accounting records. A brand also offers the firm legal protection for unique features or aspects of the product. A brand can retain intellectual property rights, giving legal title to the brand owner.¹⁵ The brand name can be protected through registered trademarks; manufacturing processes can be protected through patents; and packaging can be protected through copyrights and designs. These intellectual property rights ensure that the firm can safely invest in the brand and reap the benefits of a valuable asset.

We’ve seen that these investments in the brand can endow a product with unique associations and meanings that differentiate it from other products. Brands can signal a certain level of quality so that satisfied buyers can easily choose the product again.¹⁶ This brand loyalty provides predictability and security of demand for the firm and creates barriers of entry that make it difficult for other firms to enter the market.

Although manufacturing processes and product designs may be easily duplicated, lasting impressions in the minds of individuals and organizations from years of marketing activity and product experience may not be so easily reproduced. One advantage that brands such as Colgate toothpaste, Cheerios cereal, and Levi’s jeans have is that consumers have literally grown up with them. In this sense, branding can be seen as a powerful means to secure a competitive advantage.

In short, to firms, brands represent enormously valuable pieces of legal property, capable of influencing consumer behavior, being bought and sold, and providing the security of sustained future revenues.¹⁷ For these reasons, huge sums, often representing large multiples of a brand’s earnings, have been paid for brands in mergers or acquisitions, starting with the boom years of The mid-1980s.
