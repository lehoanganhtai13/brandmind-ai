Some industries are characterized by fairly divided opinions, but consider the challenges faced by brands in the oil and gas or financial services industry which consumers have generally viewed in a negative light. By virtue of membership in the category in which it competes, an oil company may expect to face a potentially suspicious or skeptical public *regardless* of what it does.

Chapters 11 and 12 describe in detail how marketers can leverage the equity of existing brands to launch their new products.

## COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

Besides the company that makes the product, the country or geographic location from which it originates may also become linked to the brand and generate secondary associations. Many countries have become known for expertise in certain product categories or for conveying a particular type of image.

The world is becoming a “cultural bazaar” where consumers can pick and choose brands originating in different countries, based on their beliefs about the quality of certain types of products from certain countries or the image that these brands or products communicate. Thus, a consumer from anywhere in the world may choose to wear Italian suits, exercise in U.S. athletic shoes, listen to a Japanese or Korean MP3 player, drive a German car, or drink English ale.

Choosing brands with strong national ties may reflect a deliberate decision to maximize product utility and communicate self-image, based on what consumers believe about products from those countries. A number of brands are able to create a strong point-of-difference, in part because of consumers’ identification of and beliefs about the country of origin. For example, consider the following strongly linked brands and countries:

Levi’s jeans — United States  
Chanel perfume — France  
Foster’s beer — Australia  
Barilla pasta — Italy  
BMW — Germany  

Dewar’s whiskey — Scotland  
Kikkoman soy sauce — Japan  
Cadbury — England  
Gucci shoes and purses — Italy  
Mont Blanc pens — Switzerland  

Puerto Rico rum makers have leveraged their geographical roots to establish a dominant market position.
