Developing compelling points-of-difference is thus critical to effective brand positioning.48

### Choosing Points-of-Difference

A brand must offer a compelling and credible reason for choosing it over the other options. In determining whether an attribute or benefit for a brand can serve as point-of-difference, there are three key considerations. The brand association must be seen as desirable, deliverable, and differentiating. These three considerations for developing an optimal positioning align with the three perspectives on which any brand must be evaluated, namely the consumer, the company, and the competition. *Desirability* is determined from the consumer’s point of view, *deliverability* is based on a company’s inherent capabilities, and *differentiation* is determined relative to the competitors.

To function as a POD, consumers ideally would see the attribute or benefit as highly important, feel confident that the firm has the capabilities to deliver it, and be convinced that no other brand could offer it to the same extent. If these three criteria are satisfied, the brand association should have sufficient strength, favorability, and uniqueness to be an effective POD. Each of these three criteria has a number of considerations, which we look at next.

#### Desirability Criteria

Target consumers must find the POD personally relevant and important. Brands that tap into growing trends with consumers often find compelling PODs. For example, Apple & Eve’s pure, natural fruit juices have ridden the wave of the natural foods movement to find success in an increasingly health-minded beverage market.49

Just being different is not enough—the differences must matter to consumers. For example, at one time a number of brands in different product categories (colas, dishwashing soaps, beer, deodorants, gasoline) introduced clear versions of their products to better differentiate themselves. The “clear” association has not seemed to be of enduring value or to be sustainable as a point-of-difference. In most cases, these brands experienced declining market share or disappeared altogether.

#### Deliverability Criteria

The deliverability of an attribute or benefit brand association depends on both a company’s actual ability to make the product or service (*feasibility*) as well as their effectiveness in convincing consumers of their ability to do so (*communicability*), as follows:50

* Feasibility: Can the firm actually supply the benefit underlying the POD? The product and marketing must be designed in a way to support the desired association. It is obviously easier to convince consumers of some fact about the brand that they were unaware of or may have overlooked than to make changes in the product and convince consumers of the value of these changes. As noted above, perhaps the simplest and most effective approach is to point to a unique attribute of the product as a proof point or reason-to-believe. Thus, Mountain Dew may argue that it is more energizing than other soft drinks and support this claim by noting that it has a higher level of caffeine. On the other hand, when the point-of-difference is abstract or image based, support for the claim may reside in more general associations to the company that have been developed over time. Thus, Chanel No. 5 perfume may claim to be the quintessential elegant, French perfume and support this claim by noting the long association between Chanel and haute couture.

* Communicability: The key issue in communicability is consumers’ perceptions of the brand and the resulting brand associations. It is very difficult to create an association that is not consistent with existing consumer knowledge, or that consumers, for whatever reason, have trouble believing in. What factual, verifiable evidence or “proof points” can marketers communicate as support, so that consumers will actually believe in the brand and its desired associations? These “reasons-to-believe” are critical for consumer acceptance of a potential POD. Any claims must pass legal scrutiny too. The makers of category leader POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice have battled with the Federal Trade Commission over what the FTC deems as “false and unsubstantiated claims” about treating or preventing heart disease, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction.51

#### Differentiation Criteria

Finally, target consumers must find the POD distinctive and superior. When marketers are entering a category in which there are established brands, the challenge is to find a viable, long-term basis for differentiation. Is the positioning preemptive, defensible, and difficult to attack? Can the brand association be reinforced and strengthened over time? If these are the case, the positioning is likely to last for years.
