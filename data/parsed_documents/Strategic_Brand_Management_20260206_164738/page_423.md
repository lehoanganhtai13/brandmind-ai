*Selectively employ sub-brands.* Sub-brands can communicate relatedness *and* distinctiveness and are a means of complementing and strengthening brands.  
5. *Selectively extend brands.* As Chapter 12 explains, brand extensions should establish new brand equity and enhance existing brand equity.

## REVIEW

A key aspect of managing brand equity is adopting the proper branding strategy. Brand names of products typically consist of a combination of different names and other brand elements. A brand architecture strategy for a firm identifies which brand elements a firm chooses to apply across the various products or services it sells. Several tools aid in developing a brand architecture strategy. Combining the brand–product matrix, the brand portfolio, and the brand hierarchy with customer, company, and competitive considerations can help a marketing manager formulate the optimal brand architecture strategy.

The brand–product matrix is a graphical representation of all the firm’s brands and products, with brands as rows and the corresponding products as columns. The rows represent brand–product relationships and capture the firm’s brand extension strategy. Marketers should judge potential extensions by how effectively they leverage existing brand equity to a new product, as well as how effectively the extension, in turn, contributes to the equity of the existing parent brand. The columns of the matrix represent product–brand relationships and capture the brand portfolio strategy in terms of the number and nature of brands to be marketed in each category.

We characterize a brand architecture strategy according to its breadth in terms of brand–product relationships and brand extension strategy, and its depth in terms of product–brand relationships and the brand portfolio or mix. Breadth describes the product mix and which products the firm should manufacture or sell. Depth deals with the brand portfolio and the set of all brands and brand lines that a particular seller offers.

A firm may offer multiple brands in a category to attract different—and potentially mutually exclusive—market segments. Brands also can take on very specialized roles in the portfolio: as flanker brands to protect more valuable brands, as low-end entry-level brands to expand the customer franchise, as high-end prestige brands to enhance the worth of the entire brand line, or as cash cows to milk all potentially realizable profits. Companies must be careful to understand exactly what each brand should do for the firm and, more important, what they want it to do for the customer.

A brand hierarchy reveals an explicit ordering of all brand names by displaying the number and nature of common and distinctive brand name elements across the firm’s products. By capturing the potential branding relationships among the different products sold by the firm, a brand hierarchy graphically portrays a firm’s branding strategy. One simple representation of possible brand elements and thus of potential levels of a brand hierarchy is (from top to bottom): corporate (or company) brand, family brand, individual brand, and modifier.

In designing a brand hierarchy, marketers should define the number of different levels of brands (generally two or three) and the relative emphasis that brands at different levels will receive when combined to brand any one product. One common strategy to brand a new product is to create a sub-brand, combining an existing company or family brand with a new individual brand. When marketers use multiple brand names, as with a sub-brand, the relative visibility of each brand element determines its prominence. Brand visibility and prominence will depend on factors such as the order, size, color, and other aspects of the brand’s physical appearance. To provide structure and content to the brand hierarchy, marketers must make clear to consumers the specific means by which a brand applies across different products and, if different brands are used for different products, the relationships among them.

In designing the supporting marketing program in the context of a brand hierarchy, marketers must define the desired awareness and image at each level of the brand hierarchy for each product. In a sub-branding situation, the desired awareness of a brand at any level will dictate the relative prominence of the brand and the extent to which associations linked to the brand will transfer to the product. In terms of building brand equity, we should link associations at any one level based on principles of relevance and differentiation. In general, we want to create associations relevant to as many brands nested at the level below as possible and to distinguish any brands at the same level.
