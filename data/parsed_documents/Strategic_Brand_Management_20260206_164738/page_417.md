# PHILIPS

To reposition itself as a more consumer-friendly brand, Philips Consumer Electronics launched a global corporate advertising campaign in 2004 that ran for a number of years. Centered on the company’s new tagline, “Sense and Simplicity,” which replaced the nine-year-old “Let’s Make Things Better,” the ads showcased innovative Philips products like the Flat TV with Ambilight, the HDRW720 DVD recorder with built-in hard disk, and the Sonicare Elite toothbrush fitting in effortlessly with users’ sophisticated lifestyles. Philips president and CEO Gerard Kleisterlee described the repositioning campaign by saying, 

> “Our route to innovation isn’t about complexity—it’s about simplicity, which we believe will be the new cool.”[^46]

To maximize the probability of success, however, marketers must clearly define the objectives of a corporate image campaign *and* carefully measure results against them.[^47] A number of different objectives are possible in a corporate brand campaign:[^48]

* Build awareness of the company and the nature of its business.
* Create favorable attitudes and perceptions of company credibility.
* Link beliefs that can be leveraged by product-specific marketing.
* Make a favorable impression on the financial community.
* Motivate present employees and attract better recruits.
* Influence public opinion on issues.

In terms of building customer-based brand equity, the first three objectives are particularly critical. A corporate image campaign can enhance awareness and create a more positive image of the corporate brand that will influence consumer evaluations and increase the equity associated with individual products and any related sub-brands. In certain cases, however, the latter three objectives can take on greater importance.[^49]

A corporate image campaign may be useful when mergers or acquisitions transform the company. Consolidation in the financial services industry has caused firms like Zurich and UBS to develop and implement strong corporate branding strategies.

# UBS

UBS was formed in 1998 when Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation merged. The bank struggled for recognition outside Switzerland, especially in the United States. After a period of acquiring better-known companies such as SG Warburg and PaineWebber, UBS engaged in a comprehensive review of its branding strategy. The results showed product overlap among UBS businesses, a weak branding culture, and a focus on individual employees rather than the brand. The company decided to adopt the UBS brand for all its businesses, and, in order to build brand equity, it launched a global brand-building effort emphasizing the bank’s scope and resources, while also playing up its one-on-one client relationships. The “You and Us” campaign debuted in 2004, with global campaign expenditures above $100 million. The goal was to assure customers that they could rely on the breadth and depth of the bank’s offerings, whatever their financial needs. By 2010, the brand had become a perennial entry in Interbrand’s Top 100 global brands.[^50]

Like product advertising, corporate image campaigns are becoming more creative and often include digital strategies as an integral component. For its new “Solutionism. The New Optimism.” campaign, Dow Chemical put up a giant 46-foot chalkboard in Soho, Manhattan. Over a series of days, an elaborate set of equations described as a mathematical poem emerged, with numbers representing significant human achievements through history, such as “the year the Great Pyramid of Giza was completed,” “Golden Gate Bridge length in feet,” and “GIANT leaps for mankind.” The public was invited to participate and guess the meanings of different elements of the poem through Twitter (@giantchalkboard) and a giantchalkboard.com Web site. When the full equation appeared on the fifth day, its solution totaled 7 billion, the total world population.[^51]

Unlike a corporate image campaign that presents the brand in abstract terms with few, if any, references to specific products, **brand line campaigns** promote a range of products associated with a brand line. By showing consumers the different uses or benefits of the multiple products offered by a brand, brand line ads or promotions can be particularly useful in building brand awareness, clarifying brand meaning, and suggesting additional usage applications. Sometimes a brand line campaign will emphasize a common thread running through all the products for a brand, as was the case with the relaunch of Lancia in Europe.
