## Crisis Marketing Guidelines

Another brand sharply criticized for its crisis response was Exxon. Although this company spent millions of dollars advertising its gasoline and crafting its brand image over the years, it essentially ignored the need to market its corporate identity and image.

This decision came back to haunt the company in the weeks following March 24, 1989, the day the tanker *Exxon Valdez* hit a reef in Prince William Sound, spilling some 11,000,000 gallons of oil into the waters off the Alaska shoreline. The spill wreaked devastation on the fish and wildlife of some 1,300 previously unspoiled square miles. Top Exxon officials declined to comment publicly for almost a week afterward, and the public statements they eventually made sometimes appeared to contradict information from other sources (for instance, regarding the severity of the spill) or blamed other parties, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, for the slow clean-up efforts.

Exxon received withering negative press and was the source of countless jokes on late-night talk shows. In frustration and anger, some customers cut up their Exxon credit cards. On April 3, fully 10 days after the accident, Exxon’s chairman released a full-page open letter to the public expressing the company’s concern and justifying its efforts to address the situation.<sup>34</sup>

Brands as diverse as Wendy’s restaurants, Firestone tires, Tyco diversified holdings, and Vioxx painkiller have all experienced a potentially crippling brand crisis. Marketing managers must assume that at some point in time, a similar incident will occur. In general, the better they have established brand equity and a strong corporate image—especially credibility and trustworthiness—the more likely their firm can weather the storm.

Careful preparation and a well-managed crisis management program are also critical, however. Most experts would agree that the Exxon incident is a good example of how *not* to handle a brand crisis. As Johnson & Johnson’s nearly flawless handling of the Tylenol product tampering incident suggests, the two keys to effectively managing a crisis are that the firm’s response should be swift *and* that it should be sincere.<sup>35</sup> Marketers do not necessarily have to admit they are wrong in any way, just that they are concerned and will as quickly and thoroughly find out what has happened, keeping the customer’s best interests in mind. Brands that drag their heels in recognizing and responding to a crisis inevitably encounter problems.

### Swiftness

The longer it takes a firm to respond to a marketing crisis, the more likely that customers will form negative impressions based on unfavorable media coverage or word-of-mouth. Perhaps worse, they may decide they do not really like the brand after all and permanently switch to alternatives.

For example, Perrier was forced to halt production worldwide and recall all existing bottles in February 1994 when traces of benzene, a known carcinogen, were found in excessive quantities in the bottled water. Over the next few weeks, several explanations were offered about how the contamination occurred, creating confusion and skepticism. Perhaps even more damaging, the product was off the shelves until May.

Despite an expensive relaunch featuring ads and promotions, Perrier struggled to regain lost market share, and a full year later its sales were still less than half what they once had been. One reason is that while the product was unavailable, consumers and retailers found satisfactory substitutes such as Saratoga and San Pellegrino. With its key “purity” association tarnished (the brand had been advertised as the “Earth’s First Soft Drink” and “It’s Perfect. It’s Perrier.”), the brand had no other compelling points-of-difference over these competitors.<sup>36</sup>

Finally, compounding the problems arising from the marketing crisis, Perrier was developing an increasingly stodgy image of appealing to the over-45 consumer rather than those under 25. Eventually, the company was taken over by Nestlé SA.

### Sincerity

Swift actions must also come across as sincere. Public acknowledgment of the severity of the impact on consumers and willingness to take whatever steps are necessary and feasible to solve the crisis reduce the chance that consumers will form negative attributions for the firm’s behavior.

For example, although Gerber had established a strong image of trust with consumers, baby food is a product category characterized by an extremely high level of involvement and need for reassurance. When consumers reported finding shards of glass in some jars of its baby food, Gerber tried to reassure the public that there were no problems in its manufacturing plants but adamantly refused to have its baby food withdrawn from grocery stores. Some consumers clearly found Gerber’s response unsatisfactory, because its market share slumped from 66 percent to 52 percent within a couple of months. As one company official admits, “Not pulling our baby food off the shelf gave the appearance that we aren’t a caring company.”<sup>37</sup>

Brand crises are difficult to manage because, despite a firm’s best efforts, these situations are hard to control. To some extent, the firm is at the mercy of public sentiment and media coverage, which it can attempt to direct and influence but which sometimes take on a life of their own. Swift and sincere words and actions go a long way toward defusing the situation.
