# BRANDING BRIEF 2-1

## Positioning Politicians

The importance of marketing has not been lost on politicians, and, although there are a number of different ways to interpret their words and actions, one way to interpret campaign strategies is from a branding perspective. For example, consultants to political candidates stress the importance of having “high name ID” or, in other words, a high level of brand awareness. In major races, at least 90 percent awareness is desired. Consultants also emphasize “positives–negatives”—voters’ responses when asked whether they think positively or negatively of a candidate. A 3:1 ratio is desired (and 4:1 is even better). This measure corresponds to brand attitude in marketing terms.

The last three decades of presidential campaigns are revealing about the importance of properly positioning a politician. George H. W. Bush ran a textbook presidential campaign in 1988. The objective was to move the candidate to the center of the political spectrum and make him a “safe” choice, and to move his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, to the left and make him seem more liberal and a “risky” choice. Specific goals were to create a point-of-difference on traditional Republican issues such as defense, the economy (and taxes), and crime and to create a point-of-parity—thus negating the opponent’s point-of-difference—on traditional Democratic issues such as the environment, education, and abortion rights. Having successfully achieved these points-of-parity and points-of-difference in the minds of the voters, Bush won in a landslide.

Although the Republicans ran a nearly flawless campaign in 1988, that was not the case in 1992. The new Democratic candidate, Bill Clinton, was a fierce campaigner who ran a focused effort to create a key point-of-difference on one main issue—the economy. Rather than attempting to achieve a point-of-parity on this issue, Bush, who was running for reelection, campaigned on other issues such as family values. By conceding a key point-of-difference to the Democrats and failing to create a compelling one of their own, Bush and the Republicans were defeated handily.

Failing to learn from their mistakes, the Republicans ran a meandering campaign in 1996 that failed to achieve either points-of-parity or points-of-difference. Not surprisingly, their presidential candidate, Bob Dole, lost decisively to the incumbent Bill Clinton. The closeness of the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush reflected the failure of either candidate to create a strong point-of-difference with the electorate. There was a similarly tight election in 2004 because neither George W. Bush nor John Kerry was successful at carving out a strong position in voters’ minds.

The 2008 presidential election, however, was another textbook application of branding as Barack Obama ran a very sophisticated and modern marketing campaign. Republican candidate John McCain attempted to create a point-of-difference on experience and traditional Republican values; Obama sought to create a point-of-difference on new ideas and hope. Their vice presidential choices helped shore up their needed points-of-parity: Joe Biden for Obama offered trusted seniority; Sarah Palin for McCain, albeit controversial, offered a younger, fresher voice.

The Obama campaign team effectively hammered home his message. Multimedia tactics combined offline and online media as well as free and paid media. In addition to traditional print, broadcast, and outdoor ads, social media like Facebook, Meetup, YouTube, and Twitter and long-form videos were employed so people could learn more about Obama and the passion others had about the candidate. Even Obama’s slogans (“Yes We Can” and “Change We Can Believe In”) and campaign posters (the popular stencil portrait of Obama in solid red, white, and pastel and dark shades of blue with the word “PROGRESS,” “HOPE,” or “CHANGE” prominently below) became iconic symbols, and Obama breezed to victory.
