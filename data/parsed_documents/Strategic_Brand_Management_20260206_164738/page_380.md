# REVIEW

This chapter considered the two main ways to measure the benefits or outcomes of brand equity: comparative methods (a means to better assess the effects of consumer perceptions and preferences on aspects of the marketing program) and holistic methods (attempts to come up with an estimate of the overall value of the brand). Figure 10-2 summarizes the different but complementary approaches. In fact, understanding the particular range of benefits for a brand on the basis of comparative methods may be useful as an input in estimating the overall value of a brand by holistic methods.

Combining these outcome measures with the measures of sources of brand equity from Chapter 9 as part of the brand value chain can provide insight into the effectiveness of marketing actions. Nevertheless, assessing the ROI of marketing activities remains a challenge. Here are four general guidelines for creating and measuring ROI from brand marketing activities:

1. **Spend wisely––focus and be creative.** To be able to measure ROI, we need to be earning a return to begin with! Investing in distinctive and well-designed marketing activities increases the chance for a more positive and discernible ROI.  
2. **Look for benchmarks––examine competitive spending levels and historical company norms.** It is important to get the lay of the land in a market or category in order to understand what we may expect.  
3. **Be strategic––apply brand equity models.** Use models such as the brand resonance model and the brand value chain to provide discipline and a structured approach to planning, implementing, and interpreting marketing activity.  
4. **Be observant––track both formally and informally.** Qualitative and quantitative insights can help us understand brand performance.

Perhaps the dominant theme of this chapter and the preceding chapter on measuring sources of brand equity is the importance of using multiple measures and research methods to capture the richness and complexity of brand equity. No matter how carefully we apply them, single measures of brand equity provide at best a one- or two-dimensional view of a brand and risk

> **Comparative methods:** Use experiments that examine consumer attitudes and behavior toward a brand, to more directly assess the benefits arising from having a high level of awareness and strong, favorable, and unique brand associations.
> 
> * **Brand-based comparative approaches:** Experiments in which one group of consumers responds to an element of the marketing program when it is attributed to the brand and another group responds to that same element when it is attributed to a competitive or fictitiously named brand.
> 
> * **Marketing-based comparative approaches:** Experiments in which consumers respond to changes in elements of the marketing program for the brand or competitive brands.
> 
> * **Conjoint analysis:** A survey-based multivariate technique that enables marketers to profile the consumer buying decision process with respect to products and brands.
> 
> **Holistic methods:** Attempt to place an overall value on the brand in either abstract utility terms or concrete financial terms. Thus, holistic methods attempt to “net out” various considerations to determine the unique contribution of the brand.
> 
> * **Residual approach:** Examines the value of the brand by subtracting out from overall brand preferences consumers’ preferences for the brand based on physical product attributes alone.
> 
> * **Valuation approach:** Places a financial value on the brand for accounting purposes, mergers and acquisitions, or other such reasons.

Figure 10-2 outlines key measures for assessing the outcomes of brand equity, presenting a structured overview of how brand equity translates into tangible results. The figure categorizes these outcomes into distinct areas, highlighting the multifaceted impact of strong brand equity. These measures encompass aspects related to consumer behavior, financial performance, and market position. Specifically, it details how brand equity influences consumer perceptions, such as brand loyalty and perceived quality, which in turn drive purchasing decisions and repeat business. Furthermore, the figure illustrates the financial implications, including increased market share, premium pricing capabilities, and ultimately, enhanced profitability. The overarching structure appears to be a framework that connects the abstract concept of brand equity to concrete, measurable business results, demonstrating its strategic importance. missing important dimensions of brand equity.
