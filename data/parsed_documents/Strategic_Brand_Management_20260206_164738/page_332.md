# BRANDING BRIEF 9-3

## Gordon Ramsay

Gordon Ramsay is arguably the world’s most successful chef and is in constant search of culinary perfection. He is a high-profile television personality and restaurateur who has been awarded 13 Michelin stars. Gordon has always courted controversy and media attention to create excitement in Gordon Ramsay the brand, which he projects onto his global restaurants.

Ramsay is associated with many different and contradictory associations, but notably stands for quality and exclusivity. He is extremely ambitious and has an expanding chain of high-end restaurants, with endless media coverage on his assessment of restaurants and hands-on improvement.

Ramsay trained under Marco Pierre White for two years in London, which catapulted his career onto the big stage. He opened his first restaurant in London in 1998, which won its third Michelin star three years later. Ramsay’s restaurant empire rapidly expanded to 12 venues across the UK. He has also opened restaurants in Doha, Dubai, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, and Ireland. Each restaurant is unique, designed to appeal to different consumers and local palates worldwide. The similarities include high quality fuss-free continental food that is well made, well presented and served in a pleasant setting.

Ramsay is a flamboyant and colorful character and is often featured in the news. He comes across as an expressive, loudmouthed, competitive, forceful, temperamental perfectionist who can be explosive. He has had public spats with his mentor Marco Pierre White and his protégée Marcus Wareing. He also publicly fell out and then split with his long-term business partner and father-in-law Chris Hutcheson. His brother, Ronald Ramsay, also received media attention in 2007 for being sent to jail in Indonesia for possession of heroin.

Ramsay has participated in fly-on-the-wall documentaries since 1998, notably reality shows *Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares* and *Hell’s Kitchen*, which showcased his short temper and perfectionism. He seems to create mesmerizing television entertainment with his explosive style, frank feedback, and use of profanity on-air. The viewer never really knows what might happen next.

Ramsay courts danger and projects a macho image. In 2006, he fell off an 85-meter cliff in Iceland and into the icy water below, and saved himself by removing his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. He held the top spot on the celebrity leader board in *Top Gear*, a British motoring program, before being overtaken by Simon Cowell. The macho image pervades in his restaurants where the décor is masculine, simple, and stylish.

Ramsay has been involved in a series of charitable events and organizations. He recently set up a commercial kitchen at Brixton prison, to train the inmates to make food to sell outside to help toward the prison’s upkeep.

Ramsay has written 21 books and contributed to a food and drink column in the British newspaper *The Times*. Ramsay continues to be a larger-than-life character who attracts media attention and controversy. He is a brand in his own right and has a Web site that profiles his background as well as information about his restaurants. Consumers continue to be intrigued by his colorful background and eventful life, and the media readily engage him in programs to keep their ratings up.

Gordon Ramsay is a famous chef, and due to all the additional associations, the Gordon Ramsay brand looks as if it will continue to grow. His restaurants have waitlists, and attract well-heeled consumers that love to flaunt that they dined in his restaurants.
