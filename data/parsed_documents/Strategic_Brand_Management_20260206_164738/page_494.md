# BRANDING BRIEF 13-3

## Harley-Davidson Motor Company

Harley-Davidson is one of the few companies in the world that can claim a legion of fans so dedicated to the brand that some of them get tattoos of the logo. Even more impressive is the fact that the company attracted such a loyal customer base with a minimum of advertising. Founded in 1903 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it has twice narrowly escaped bankruptcy and is today one of the most recognized brands in the world.

In recovering from its financial downfalls, Harley-Davidson realized its product needed to better live up to the brand promise. Quality problems plagued the product line in the 1970s. Although consumers loved what the brand represented, they hated the constant need for repairs. The joke was that you needed to have two Harleys because one was always in the shop!

Harley’s back-to-basics approach to revitalization centered on improving factories and production process to achieve higher levels of quality. The company also dialed up marketing efforts to better sell its products. Establishing a broader access point with consumers to make the brand relevant to more people, Harley was able to attract a diverse customer base that went way beyond the traditional biker image. The company also changed the way it went to market.

Before the 1980s, Harley-Davidson relied almost exclusively on word-of-mouth endorsements and the image of its user group to sell its motorcycles. In 1983, the company established an owners’ club, the Harley Owners Group (HOG), which sponsors bike rallies, charity rides, and other motorcycle events. Every Harley owner becomes a member for free by signing up at the www.hog.com Web site. In its first year, HOG had 33,000 members. Now, it has more than one million in 1,400 chapters throughout the world.

In the early 1980s, Harley-Davidson began a licensing program to protect its trademarks and promote the brand. Early efforts primarily supported the riding experience with products like T-shirts, jewelry, small leather goods, and other products appealing to riders. Currently, the primary target for licensed products is existing customers through the Harley dealer network. To attract new customers, though, Harley-Davidson has licensed children’s clothing, toys, games, and many other items aimed at children and sold beyond the dealer network. In the world of licensing, Harley-Davidson is considered an “evergreen” brand and earns the company tens of millions in revenue annually.

Motorcycle riding gear has been around almost as long as motorcycles. As business grew, Harley-Davidson created Harley-Davidson MotorClothes to produce traditional riding gear along with men’s and women’s casual sportswear and accessories to reach an ever-expanding and diverse customer base of riders and non-riders. Harley MotorClothes is a key facet of the company’s General Merchandise division, whose revenues nearly doubled from $151 million in 2000 to $274 million in 2011.

Harley-Davidson continues to promote its brand with grassroots marketing efforts. Many employees and executives at the company own Harleys and often ride them with customers, making traditional advertising almost unnecessary. As ever, Harley’s highly visible contingent of riders provides invaluable promotions and endorsements free of cost. Many other marketers seek to borrow the Harley cachet and use the bikes in their ads, giving the company free product placement.

One of the newest growth areas is women. For women and smaller riders, Harley offers Sportster motorcycles that are built low to the ground with narrower seats, softer clutches, and adjustable handlebars and windshields. Several times a year Harley dealers hold garage parties for women to help them learn about their bikes. Five hundred such events in March 2010 attracted 27,000 women, almost half of whom were at a Harley dealer for the first time, leading to 3,000 new bikes sold. After making up only 2 percent of Harley owners in 1995, women now represent about 12 percent of sales.
