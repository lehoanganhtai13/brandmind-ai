5. *Failure to adequately control the brand:* All employees of the firm must understand brand equity, and the firm’s actions must reflect a broader corporate perspective as well as a more specific product perspective. Firms sometimes make decisions haphazardly, without a true understanding of the current and desired brand equity or recognition of the impact these decisions have on other brands or brand-related activities.

6. *Failure to properly balance consistency and change with the brand:* Managing a brand necessitates striking the delicate, but crucial, balance between maintaining continuity in marketing activities and keeping the product or image of a brand up-to-date. If managers do not make adjustments in their marketing program to reflect changes in the marketing environment, they can be left behind. Or they may make so many changes that the brand becomes a moving target without any meaning to consumers.

7. *Failure to understand the complexity of brand equity measurement and management:* Effective brand management requires discipline, creativity, focus, and the ability to make hundreds of decisions in the best possible manner. Sometimes marketers oversimplify the process and try to equate success in branding with taking one particular action or approach. Brand equity is not optimized as a result.

One of the most skilled brand-builders is Procter & Gamble. Branding Brief 15-2 describes some of the ways it has changed its marketing processes and philosophy in recent years to reflect new marketing realities.

# FUTURE BRAND PRIORITIES

Our journey to better understand strategic brand management is about over, but it’s worth considering a few final questions. How will branding change in the coming years? What are the biggest branding challenges? What will make a successful “twenty-first-century brand?”

The importance of branding seems unlikely to change for one critical reason: Consumers will continue to value the functions brands provide. In an increasingly complex world, well-managed brands can simplify, communicate, reassure, and provide important meaning to consumers.<sup>3</sup> Brands have survived for centuries because they serve a very fundamental purpose. At their best, they allow consumers to reduce risk and gain greater satisfaction in their lives. Strong brands can make consumers’ lives a little—or sometimes even a lot—better. The role and functions of brands are so fundamentally pervasive and valued by consumers, it is difficult to see their *potential* importance diminishing.

However, managing brands to achieve that potential is as challenging as ever.<sup>4</sup> The marketing environment always changes, but the pace of change has greatly accelerated in the past decade. Consumers are increasingly diverse, enlightened, and empowered. Virtually every market has experienced heightened competition as a result of the entrance of global firms, private labels, and megabrands from related categories. Rapidly changing technology has profoundly affected how consumers live and shop and how marketers learn about consumer needs and wants and manage their brands. Finally, serious environmental, community, and social concerns exist all over the world.

As a result, the rules of the branding game have changed.<sup>5</sup> Marketers are rethinking—and sometimes fundamentally altering—their branding policies and practices. Using the principles reflected in the brand report card and avoiding the seven deadly sins of brand management reviewed earlier should help in the pursuit of brand management. Building on prior concepts and examples from the book, this final section highlights six branding imperatives to help managers navigate the challenges of brand management in the years to come, as summarized in Figure 15-9.<sup>6</sup>

## 1. Fully and Accurately Factor the Consumer into the Branding Equation

One of the most important rules of branding is, “The consumer owns the brand.” The power of consumer perceptions and beliefs to make or break brands has been demonstrated time and again in the lab and in the real world. From the New Coke debacle to the modern challenges Detroit automakers face in convincing consumers of the quality of their vehicles, consumer sovereignty rules.

In turn, successful brands create mental structures and knowledge in consumers’ minds that cause them to favor the brand. From a managerial perspective, a consumer voice must be incorporated in every branding decision. To illustrate, consider brand architecture decisions. Managers frequently err in naming new products by taking an internal company perspective
