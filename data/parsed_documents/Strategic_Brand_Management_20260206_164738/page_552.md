Mix and match brand elements—brand names, logos, symbols, characters, slogans, jingles, and packages—by choosing different brand elements to achieve different objectives and by designing brand elements to be as mutually reinforcing as possible.  
2. Ensure a high level of perceived quality and create a rich brand image by linking tangible and intangible product-related and non-product-related associations to the brand.  
3. Adopt value-based pricing strategies to set prices and guide discount pricing policies over time that reflect consumers’ perceptions of value and willingness to pay a premium.  
4. Consider a range of direct and indirect distribution options and blend brand-building push strategies for retailers and other channel members with brand-building pull strategies for consumers.  
5. Mix marketing communication options by choosing a broad set of communication options based on their differential ability to affect brand awareness and create, maintain, or strengthen favorable and unique brand associations. Match marketing communication options by ensuring consistency and directly reinforcing some communication options with other communication options.  
6. Leverage secondary associations to compensate for otherwise missing dimensions of the marketing program by linking the brand to other entities such as companies, channels of distribution, other brands, characters, spokespeople or other endorsers, or events that reinforce and augment the brand image.

**Themes.** A dominant theme across many of these different ways to build brand equity is the importance of complementarity and consistency. Ensuring *complementarity* means choosing different brand elements and supporting marketing activities so that the potential contribution to brand equity of one compensates for the shortcomings of others. For example, some brand elements may primarily enhance awareness through a memorable brand logo, whereas others may facilitate the linkage of brand associations with a meaningful brand name or a clever slogan. Similarly, an ad campaign might create a certain point-of-difference association, whereas a retail promotion creates a vital point-of-parity association. Finally, we can link certain other entities to the brand to leverage secondary associations, provide other sources of brand equity, or further reinforce existing associations.

Thus, it is important to put into place a varied set of brand elements and marketing activities and programs in order to create the desired level of awareness and type of image that leads to brand equity. At the same time, a high degree of *consistency* across these elements helps create the highest level of awareness and the strongest and most favorable associations possible. Consistency ensures that diverse brand and marketing mix elements share a common core meaning, perhaps by conveying the same information, such as a benefit association that is reinforced by a highly integrated, well-branded marketing communications program.

**Measuring Brand Equity.** We can gauge brand equity indirectly by measuring its potential sources, and directly by measuring its possible outcomes. This means measuring aspects of brand awareness and brand image leading to the differential customer response that creates brand equity: breadth and depth of brand awareness; the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations; the valence of brand responses; and the nature of brand relationships. Measuring outcomes requires us to estimate the various benefits from creating these sources of brand equity. The brand value chain depicts this relationship more broadly by considering how marketing activity affects these sources of brand equity, and how the resulting outcomes influence the investment community, as well as how various filters or multipliers intervene between the stages.

Marketers need to properly design and implement a *brand equity measurement system*, a set of research procedures designed to provide timely, accurate, and actionable information for Marketers about their brands.
