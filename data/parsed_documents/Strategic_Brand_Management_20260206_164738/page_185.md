In an age defined by the pervasiveness of mass-market goods, mass customization enables consumers to distinguish themselves with even basic purchases. The online jeweler Blue Nile lets customers design their own rings. Custom messenger-bag maker Rickshaw Bagworks lets customers design their own bags before they are made to order. Sportswear vendor Shortomatic lets customers upload their own images and overlay them on a pair of custom-designed shorts. Land’s End also allows customization of certain styles of pants and shirts on its Web site to allow for a better fit.¹⁴

Mass customization is not restricted to products. Many service organizations such as banks are developing customer-specific services and trying to improve the personal nature of their service experience with more service options, more customer-contact personnel, and longer service hours.¹⁵

Mass customization can offer supply-side benefits too. Retailers can reduce inventory, saving warehouse space and the expense of keeping track of everything and discounting leftover merchandise.¹⁶ Mass customization has its limitations, however, because not every product is easily customized and not every product demands customization. Returns are also more problematic for a customized product that may not have broader appeal.

With the advent of social media, customers can now share with others what they have co-created with firms. For example, Nike enables customers to put their own personalized message on a pair of shoes with the NIKEiD program. At the NIKEiD Web site, visitors can make a customized shoe by selecting the size, width, and color scheme and affixing an eight-character personal ID to their creation. Then they can share it with others for them to admire.¹⁷

### One-to-One Marketing.

Don Peppers and Martha Rogers popularized the concept of one-to-one marketing, an influential perspective on relationship marketing.¹⁸ The basic rationale is that consumers help add value by providing information to marketers; marketers add value, in turn, by taking that information and generating rewarding experiences for consumers. The firm is then able to create switching costs, reduce transaction costs, and maximize utility for consumers, all of which help build strong, profitable relationships.

One-to-one marketing is thus based on several fundamental strategies:

* Focus on individual consumers through consumer databases—“We single out consumers.”
* Respond to consumer dialogue via interactivity—“The consumer talks to us.”
* Customize products and services—“We make something unique for him or her.”

Another tenet of one-to-one marketing is treating different consumers differently because of their different needs, and their different current and future value to the firm. In particular, Peppers and Rogers stress the importance of devoting more marketing effort to the most valuable consumers.

With NIKEiD, customers can customize their shoes and share their creations with others online.
