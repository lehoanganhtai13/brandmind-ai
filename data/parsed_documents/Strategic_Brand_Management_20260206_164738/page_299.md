### Conducting Quantitative Research.

Qualitative research is suggestive, but a more definitive assessment of the depth and breadth of brand awareness and the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations often requires a quantitative phase of research.

The guidelines for the quantitative phase of the exploratory are relatively straightforward. Marketers should assess all potentially salient associations identified by the qualitative research phase according to their strength, favorability, and uniqueness. They should examine both specific brand beliefs and overall attitudes and behaviors to reveal potential sources and outcomes of brand equity. And they should assess the depth and breadth of brand awareness by employing various cues. Typically, marketers will also need to conduct similar types of research for competitors to better understand their sources of brand equity and how they compare with the target brand.

Much of the above discussion of qualitative and quantitative measures has concentrated on associations to the brand name—for example, what do consumers think about the brand when given its name as a probe? Marketers should study other brand elements in the brand exploratory as well, because they may trigger other meanings and facets of the brand.

For instance, we can ask consumers what inferences they make about the brand on the basis of the product packaging, logo, or other attribute alone, such as, “What would you think about the brand just on the basis of its packaging?” We can explore specific aspects of the brand elements—for example, the label on the package or the shape of the package itself—to uncover their role in creating brand associations and thus sources of brand equity. We should also determine which of these elements most effectively represents and symbolizes the brand as a whole.

### Brand Positioning and the Supporting Marketing Program

The brand exploratory should uncover the current knowledge structures for the core brand and its competitors, as well as determining the desired brand awareness and brand image and points-of-parity and points-of-difference. Moving from the current brand image to the desired brand image typically means adding new associations, strengthening existing ones, or weakening or eliminating undesirable ones in the minds of consumers according to the guidelines outlined in Chapter 2.

John Roberts, one of Australia’s top marketing academics, sees the challenge in achieving the ideal positioning for a brand as being able to achieve congruence among four key considerations:  
(1) what customers currently believe about the brand (and thus find credible),  
(2) what customers will value in the brand,  
(3) what the firm is currently saying about the brand, and  
(4) where the firm would like to take the brand (see Figure 8-5).<sup>10</sup>  

Because each of the four considerations may suggest or reflect different approaches to positioning, finding a positioning that balances the four considerations as much as possible is key.

A number of different internal management personnel can be part of the planning and positioning process, including brand, marketing research, and production managers, as can relevant outside To crystalize all the information and insights they have gained about their target market(s), researchers can employ personas.
