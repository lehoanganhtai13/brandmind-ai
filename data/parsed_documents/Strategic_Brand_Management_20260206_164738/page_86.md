Often, the key to positioning is not so much achieving a POD as achieving necessary, competitive and correlational POPs.

# POSITIONING GUIDELINES

The concepts of points-of-difference and points-of-parity can be invaluable tools to guide positioning. Two key issues in arriving at the optimal competitive brand positioning are (1) defining and communicating the competitive frame of reference and (2) choosing and establishing points-of-parity and points-of-difference.

## Defining and Communicating the Competitive Frame of Reference

A starting point in defining a competitive frame of reference for a brand positioning is to determine category membership. With which products or sets of products does the brand compete? As noted above, choosing to compete in different categories often results in different competitive frames of reference and thus different POPs and PODs.

The product’s category membership tells consumers about the goals they might achieve by using a product or service. For highly established products and services, category membership is not a focal issue. Customers are aware that Coca-Cola is a leading brand of soft drink, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes is a leading brand of cereal, McKinsey is a leading strategy consulting firm, and so on.

There are many situations, however, in which it is important to inform consumers of a brand’s category membership. Perhaps the most obvious is the introduction of new products, where the category membership is not always apparent.

### ANTABAX

Antabax is a Malaysian personal care brand that offers a range of antibacterial products. Antabax first started with its three soap ranges: Shield, Gentle, and Balance. But the challenge for Antabax is to convince customers that its products belong in the “hygiene care” category, the same category as some of Antabax’s competitors: Lifebuoy, Protex, and Dettol. Despite the brand’s longevity, the company fears that customers still don’t see its products as sitting within the health and hygiene category. By dubbing them “Halal health care products,” Antabax has reformulated and repackaged its personal care products.

The company is also working on new schemes which aim to increase customer awareness. For instance, it has introduced a new brand ambassador, Malaysian singer Ziana Zain, who is involved with the Antabax new range product launches and roadshows. It has also started an Antabax Facebook contest called “2012—My Attribution Year For Others,” and has been promoting the Antabax family of products with a “hygiene” concept in schools. Today, Antabax is the fastest growing brand within the bar and liquid medicated category.<sup>43</sup>
