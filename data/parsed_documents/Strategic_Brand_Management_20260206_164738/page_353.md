This table outlines key aspects related to "Bonding," presenting its "Advantage," "Performance," "Relevance," and "Presence." The structure suggests an analysis of bonding by examining its benefits, effectiveness, applicability, and existence. This framework likely aims to evaluate or describe the nature and impact of bonding across various contexts, potentially for comparison or to establish its significance. The components collectively provide a multi-faceted view of bonding, moving from its inherent benefits to its practical implications and observable occurrences.

a brand. As Figure 9-12 shows, the BrandDynamics model adopts a hierarchical approach to determine the strength of relationship a consumer has with a brand. The five levels of the model, in ascending order of an increasingly intense relationship, are presence, relevance, performance, advantage, and bonding. Consumers are placed into one of the five levels depending on their brand responses. By comparing the pattern across brands, we can uncover relative strengths and weaknesses and see where brands can focus their efforts to improve their loyalty relationships.

### Relationship to the CBBE Model

We can easily relate the five sequenced stages of Millward Brown’s BrandDynamics model—presence, relevance, performance, advantage, and bonding—to the four ascending steps of the CBBE model (identity, meaning, responses, and relationships) and specific CBBE model concepts (such as salience, consideration, performance or quality, superiority, and resonance).

Thus, the CBBE model synthesizes the concepts and measures from a leading industry model and at the same time provides much additional substance and insight. Several particularly noteworthy aspects of the CBBE model are  
1. its emphasis on brand salience and breadth and depth of brand awareness as the foundation of brand building;  
2. its recognition of the dual nature of brands and the significance of both rational and emotional considerations in brand building; and  
3. the importance it places on brand resonance as the culmination of brand building and a more meaningful way to view brand loyalty.

### REVIEW

According to the brand value chain, sources of brand equity arise from the customer mind-set. In general, measuring sources of brand equity requires that the brand manager fully understand how customers shop for and use products and services and, most important, what customers know, think, and feel about various brands. In particular, measuring sources of customer-based brand equity requires measuring various aspects of brand awareness and brand image that lead to the customer response that creates brand equity.

This chapter described both qualitative and quantitative approaches to measure consumers’ brand knowledge structures and identify potential sources of brand equity—that is, measures to capture the customer mind-set. Qualitative research techniques are a means to identify possible brand associations. Quantitative research techniques are a means to better approximate the breadth and depth of brand awareness; the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations; the favorability of brand responses; and the nature of brand relationships. Because of their unstructured nature, qualitative measures are especially well suited to provide an in-depth glimpse of what brands and products mean to consumers. To obtain more precise and generalizable information, however, marketers typically use quantitative scale measures.

Figure 9-13 summarizes some of the different types of measures that were discussed in the chapter.
