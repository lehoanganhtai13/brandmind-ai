# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 6-2

## Coordinating Media to Build Brand Equity

For brand equity to be built, it is critical that communication effects created by advertising be linked to the brand. Often, such links are difficult to create. TV ads in particular do not “brand” well. There are a number of reasons why:

* Competing ads in the product category can create interference and consumer confusion as to which ad goes with which brand.
* “Borrowed interest” creative strategies and techniques—humor, music, special effects, sex appeals, fear appeals, etc—may grab consumers’ attention, but result in the brand being overlooked in the process.
* Delaying brand identification or providing few brand mentions may raise processing intensity but direct attention away from the brand.
* Limited brand exposure time in the ad may allow little opportunity for elaboration of existing brand knowledge.
* Consumers may not have any inherent interest in the product or service category or may lack knowledge of the specific brand.
* A change in advertising strategy may make it difficult for consumers to easily relate new information to existing brand knowledge.

### Strategies to Strengthen Communication Effects

For a variety of reasons, advertising may “succeed” in the sense that communication effects are stored in memory, yet “fail” at the same time in that these communication effects are not accessible when critical brand-related decisions were made.

To address this problem, one common tactic marketers employ is to make the brand name and package information prominent in the ad. Unfortunately, this increase in brand emphasis means that communication effects and brand associations are less likely to be able to be created by the ad and stored in consumer memory. In other words, although consumers are better able to recall the advertised brand, there is less other information about the brand to actually recall. Three potentially more effective strategies are brand signatures, ad retrieval cues, and media interactions.

### Brand Signatures

Perhaps the easiest way to increase the strength of brand links to communication effects is to create a more powerful and compelling brand signature. The **brand signature** is the manner by which the brand is identified in a TV or radio ad or displayed within a print ad. The brand signature must creatively engage the consumer and cause him or her to pay more attention to the brand itself and, as a consequence, increase the strength of brand associations created by the ad.

An effective brand signature often dynamically and stylistically provides a seamless connection to the ad as a whole. For example, the famous “Got Milk?” campaign always displayed that tag line or slogan in a manner fitting the ad (in flames for the “yuppie in hell” ad or in primary-school print for the “school lunchroom bully” ad). As another example, the introductory Intel Inside ad campaign always ended with a swirling image from which the Intel Inside logo dramatically appeared, in effect stamping the end of the ad with Intel Inside in an “in your face” manner.

### Ad Retrieval Cues

Another effective tactic to use **advertising retrieval cues**—visual or verbal information uniquely identified with an ad that is evident when consumers are making a product or service decision. The purpose is to maximize the probability that consumers who have seen or heard the cued ad will retrieve the communication effects stored in long-term memory. Ad retrieval cues may consist of a key visual, a catchy slogan, or any unique advertising element that serves as an effective reminder to consumers. For example, in an attempt to remedy a problem of mistaken attributions, Quaker Oats placed a photograph of the “Mikey” character from the popular Life cereal ad on the front of the package. More recently, Eveready featured a picture of its pink bunny character on packages of Energizer batteries to reduce consumer confusion with Duracell.

### Media Interactions

Finally, print and radio reinforcement of TV ads (in which the video and audio components of a TV ad serve as the basis for the respective type of ads) can be an effective means to leverage existing communication effects from TV ad exposure and more strongly link them to the brand. Cueing a TV ad with an explicitly linked radio or print ad can create similar or even enhanced processing outcomes that can substitute for additional TV ad exposures. Moreover, a potentially useful, although rarely employed, media strategy is to run explicitly linked print or radio ads **prior** to the accompanying TV ad. The print and radio ads in this case function as teasers and increase consumer motivation to process the more complete TV ad consisting of both audio and video components.
