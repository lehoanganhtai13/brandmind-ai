Every time a consumer used social media to share outdoors experiences through online comments, photographs, stories, and video, the company donated $1 to the National Park Foundation’s program for kids.

Nostalgia can play a valuable role for many brands. Oreo cookies and Keds tennis shoes have run nostalgia-focused campaigns targeting adults who presumably stopped using the product long ago. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes reminded an older audience that the cereal had “The Taste Adults Have Grown to Love.” Later ads for the brand tug on the heartstrings of dads by suggesting, “Share What You Love With Who You Love.”

Research shows that nostalgic advertising can positively influence consumers. One empirical study confirmed that intentionally nostalgic advertisements yielded favorable attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand. Another study identified a potential source of nostalgic purchase behavior, called “intergenerational influence,” or the influence of a parent’s purchase behavior and brand attitudes on a child’s behavior and attitudes.

Some brands attempt to make the case that their enduring appeal is still relevant for lapsed users today. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner, long sold to parents as a meal favorite for children, turned the tables on grown-ups to remind them, “You Know You Love It.” A $50 million campaign featuring TV, print and online ads, billboards, a Web site (www.youknowyouloveit.com), and social media communications on Facebook and Twitter supported the entire product line.

Heritage appeals do not necessarily have to use advertising though, as Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) beer shows. The brand was born in 1882, when the Pabst Brewing Company began tying silk ribbons to bottles of its Select beer. The company became one of the major U.S. beer brands and remained so through 1977, when sales peaked at 18 million barrels. As competition from Budweiser and Miller increased, however, the PBR brand suffered as a consequence of price cuts, quality problems, and ownership changes.

After years of decline, sales of PBR suddenly spiked in the Portland, Oregon area in 2001. Management investigated and discovered that young trendsetters were adopting the beer as a “blue-collar, Americana” alternative to the big brands and craft beers favored by their parents. Rather than using above-the-line advertising, which it had not done since the 1970s, Pabst sought to capitalize on this market through word-of-mouth, on-premise promotions, and event sponsorships, primarily of local bands and concerts, and licensed merchandise aimed at “hipsters.”

By letting the brand’s image be created as much by consumers as by the company itself and by keeping it local, hip, and organic, Pabst increased sales over the next nine years. With the Metropoulus family as new owners, other Pabst brands became candidates for revitalization—including Schlitz, Schaefer, Stroh’s, and Falstaff. A total of 5 of the top 10 brands—from 1973!

Instances, once the problem became public, Intel endured an agonizing six-week period as the focus of media scrutiny and criticism. Intel was probably at fault—as company executives later admitted—for not telling consumers and proposing remedies more quickly. Two key sources of brand equity for Intel microprocessors like the Pentium—emphasized throughout the company’s marketing program—are “power” and “safety.” Although consumers primarily thought of safety in terms of upgradability, the potential for financial risk or other problems from a flawed chip certainly should have created a sense of urgency within Intel to protect one of its prize sources of brand equity. Eventually, Intel capitulated and offered a replacement chip. Perhaps not surprisingly, only a very small percentage of consumers (an estimated 1–3 percent) actually requested it, suggesting that it was Intel’s stubbornness to act and not the defect per se that rankled many consumers. Although it was a painful episode, Intel maintains it learned a lot about how to manage its brand in the process.<sup>5</sup>

Ideally, the key sources of brand equity are of enduring value. Unfortunately, marketers can easily overlook that value as they attempt to expand the meaning of their brands and add new product-related or non-product-related brand associations. The next section considers these types of trade-offs.
