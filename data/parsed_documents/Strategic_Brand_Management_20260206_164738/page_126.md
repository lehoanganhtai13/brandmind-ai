*The power of the brand and its ultimate value to the firm reside with customers.*

It is through learning about and experiencing a brand that customers end up thinking, feeling, and acting in a way that allows the firm to reap the benefits of brand equity. Although marketers must take responsibility for designing and implementing the most effective and efficient brand-building marketing programs possible, the success of those marketing efforts ultimately depends on how consumers respond and the actions they take. This response, in turn, depends on the knowledge that has been created in their minds and hearts for those brands. The Science of Branding 3-2 describes some criteria to determine whether a company is truly consumer-centric.

### Don’t Take Shortcuts with Brands.

The brand resonance model reinforces the fact that there are no shortcuts in building a brand. A great brand is not built by accident but is the product of carefully accomplishing—either explicitly or implicitly—a series of logically linked steps with consumers. The more explicitly marketers recognize the steps and define them as concrete goals, the more likely they will give them the proper attention and fully realize them so they can provide the greatest contribution to brand building. *The length of time to build a strong brand will therefore be directly proportional to the amount of time it takes to create sufficient awareness and understanding so that firmly held and felt beliefs and attitudes about the brand are formed that can serve as the foundation for brand equity.*

The brand-building steps may not be equally difficult. Creating brand awareness is a step that an effectively designed marketing program often can accomplish in a relatively short period of time. Unfortunately, this step is the one that many brand marketers tend to skip in their mistaken haste to quickly establish an image for the brand. It is difficult for consumers to appreciate the advantages and uniqueness of a brand unless they have some sort of frame of reference for what the brand is supposed to do and with whom or what it is supposed to compete. Similarly, consumers cannot have highly positive responses without a reasonably complete understanding of the brand’s dimensions and characteristics.

Even if, due to circumstances in the marketplace, consumers actually start a repeated-purchase or behavioral loyalty relationship with a brand without much underlying feeling, judgment, or associations, these other brand-building blocks will have to come into place at some point to create true resonance. That is, although the start point may differ, the same steps in brand building eventually must occur to create a truly strong brand.

### Brands Should Have a Duality.

One important point reinforced by the model is that a strong brand has a duality—it appeals to both the head and the heart. Thus, although there may be two different ways to build loyalty and resonance—going up the left-hand and right-hand sides of the pyramid—strong brands often do both. *Strong brands blend product performance and imagery to create a rich, varied, but complementary set of consumer responses to the brand.*

By appealing to both rational and emotional concerns, a strong brand provides consumers with multiple access points while reducing competitive vulnerability. Rational concerns can satisfy utilitarian needs, whereas emotional concerns can satisfy psychological or emotional needs. Combining the two allows brands to create a formidable brand position. Consistent with this reasoning, a McKinsey study of 51 corporate brands found that having distinctive physical *and* emotional benefits drove greater shareholder value, especially when the two were linked.<sup>41</sup>

### MASTERCARD

MasterCard is an example of a brand with much duality, because it emphasizes both the rational advantages of the credit card—its acceptance at establishments worldwide—as well as the emotional advantages—expressed in the award-winning “Priceless” advertising campaign. Ads depict people buying items to achieve both a very practical goal and a more important emotional goal. The first ad, for example, showed a father taking his son to a baseball game. As they made purchases on the way to their seats, superimposed on the screen and in a voiceover came the words:

> “Two tickets . . . $46,  
> “Two hotdogs, two popcorns, two sodas . . . $27,  
> “One autographed baseball . . . $50,  
> “Real conversation with 11-year-old son . . . priceless.” At most companies, employees don’t have any idea what their firm’s return on invested capital is, let alone the returns on specific customer segments—and even if they knew, they’d be powerless to do anything about it.
