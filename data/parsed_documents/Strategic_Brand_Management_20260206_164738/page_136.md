## Blattberg and Colleagues.

> We first measure each customer’s expected contribution toward offsetting the company’s fixed costs over the expected life of that customer. Then we discount the expected contributions to a net present value at the company’s target rate of return for marketing investments. Finally, we add together the discounted, expected contributions of all current contributions.

The authors offer the following observation:

> Ultimately, we contend that the appropriate question for judging new products, new programs, and new customer-service initiatives should not be, Will it attract new customers? or, Will it increase our retention rates? but rather, Will it grow our customer equity? The goal of maximizing customer equity by balancing acquisition and retention efforts properly should serve as the star by which a company steers its entire marketing program.

Blattberg and Deighton offer eight guidelines as a means of maximizing customer equity:

1. **Invest in highest-value customers first.**  
2. **Transform product management into customer management.**  
3. **Consider how add-on sales and cross-selling can increase customer equity.**  
4. **Look for ways to reduce acquisition costs.**  
5. **Track customer equity gains and losses against marketing programs.**  
6. **Relate branding to customer equity.**  
7. **Monitor the intrinsic retainability of your customers.**  
8. **Consider writing separate marketing plans—or even building two marketing organizations—for acquisition and retention efforts.**

## Rust, Zeithaml, and Lemon.

Rust, Zeithaml, and Lemon define customer equity as the discounted lifetime values of a firm’s customer base.[^49] According to their view, customer equity is made up of three components and key drivers:

* **Value equity:** Customers’ objective assessment of the utility of a brand based on perceptions of what is given up for what is received. Three drivers of value equity are quality, price, and convenience.  
* **Brand equity:** Customers’ subjective and intangible assessment of the brand, above and beyond its objectively perceived value. Three key drivers of brand equity are customer brand awareness, customer brand attitudes, and customer perception of brand ethics.  
* **Relationship equity:** Customers’ tendency to stick with the brand, above and beyond objective and subjective assessments of the brand. Four key drivers of relationship equity are loyalty programs, special recognition and treatment programs, community-building programs, and knowledge-building programs.

Note that this definition of brand equity differs from the customer-based brand equity definition proposed in this text, which puts the focus on the beneficial differential response to marketing activity that strong brands produce.

These authors propose that the three components of customer equity vary in importance by company and industry. For example, they suggest that brand equity will matter more with low-involvement purchases involving simple decision processes (like facial tissues), when the product is highly visible to others, when experiences associated with the product can be passed from one individual or generation to the next, or when it is difficult to evaluate the quality of a product or service prior to consumption. On the other hand, value equity will be more important in business-to-business settings, whereas retention equity will be more important for companies that sell a variety of products and services to the same customer.
