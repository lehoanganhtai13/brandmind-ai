The hope is that the celebrities’ fans will also become fans of their products or services. The celebrity must be well enough known to improve awareness, image, and responses for the brand.

In particular, a celebrity endorser should have a high level of visibility and a rich set of potentially useful associations, judgments, and feelings.³⁶ Ideally, he or she would be credible in terms of expertise, trustworthiness, and likability or attractiveness, as well as having specific associations that carry potential product relevance. One person who has done a remarkable job building and leveraging a highly credible brand is Oprah Winfrey.

## OPRAH WINFREY

One of the most successful and valuable person brands in the world is Oprah Winfrey—*Forbes* magazine estimates her net worth at a staggering $2.7 billion. Overcoming a childhood of poverty and other personal challenges and driven by her own motto, “Live Your Best Life,” she has parlayed her relentless optimism and drive for self-improvement into an entertainment franchise covering all media markets and corners of the globe. Her empathetic connection with her audience has created a marketing gold mine in the process. At its peak, her television talk show was seen by 12 million viewers daily in the United States alone, while also airing in 144 countries around the world. Her Harpo production company, shrewdly formed early in her show’s syndication life, has also launched hit spin-off shows for some of her most popular guests such as Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, Rachel Ray, and design expert Nate Berkus. Her magazine, *O, the Oprah Magazine*, published by Hearst, has a circulation of roughly 2.5 million. Winfrey has produced Broadway shows, feature films, and television movies and has her own satellite radio station. After ending the 25-year run of her broadcast television show on May 25, 2011, she turned her energy to her new cable channel, OWN. Her sincere nature and credibility with her audience has made any product or brand endorsements instant hits. “Oprah’s Book Club” launched many best-sellers and is credited by some with saving the publishing industry. Her annual infomercial-like “Favorite Things” show transformed sometimes low-profile brands into overnight successes. When Greenburg Smoked Turkey from Tyler, TX got a 42-second mention on one such show, it received $1 million in orders for the upcoming holiday season.³⁷

### Potential Problems

Despite the potential upside of linking a celebrity endorser to a brand, there are a number of potential problems. First, celebrity endorsers can endorse so many products that they lack any specific product meaning or are seen as opportunistic or insincere. Although NFL star quarterback Peyton Manning has parlayed success on the football field and his “Aw shucks” personality into endorsement contracts for a number of different brands—DirectTV, Gatorade, MasterCard, Oreo, Reebok, and Sprint, among others—he runs the risk of overexposure, especially given that so many of his ads run concurrently with the football season.³⁸
