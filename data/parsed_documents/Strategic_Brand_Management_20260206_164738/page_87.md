For example, consumers may be aware that Sony produces computers, but they may not be certain whether Sony Vaio computers are in the same “class” as Dell, HP, and Lenovo. In this instance, it might be useful to reinforce category membership.

Brands are sometimes affiliated with categories in which they do not hold membership rather than with the one in which they do. This approach is a viable way to highlight a brand’s point-of-difference from competitors, provided that consumers know the brand’s actual membership. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb ran commercials at one time for its Excedrin aspirin acknowledging Tylenol’s perceived consumer acceptance for aches and pains, but touting the Excedrin brand as “the Headache Medicine.” With this approach, however, it is important that consumers understand what the brand is, and not just what it is *not*.

The preferred approach to positioning is to inform consumers of a brand’s membership before stating its point-of-difference in relationship to other category members. Presumably, consumers need to know what a product is and what function it serves before they can decide whether it dominates the brands against which it competes. For new products, separate marketing programs are generally needed to inform consumers of membership and to educate them about a brand’s point-of-difference. For brands with limited resources, this implies the development of a marketing strategy that establishes category membership prior to one that states a point-of-difference. Brands with greater resources can develop concurrent marketing programs, one of which features membership and the other the point-of-difference. Efforts to inform consumers of membership and points-of-difference in the same ad, however, are often not effective.

There are three main ways to convey a brand’s category membership: communicating category benefits, comparing to exemplars, and relying on a product descriptor.

### Communicating Category Benefits.

To reassure consumers that a brand will deliver on the fundamental reason for using a category, marketers frequently use benefits to announce category membership. Thus, industrial motors might claim to have power, and analgesics might announce their efficacy. These benefits are presented in a manner that does not imply brand superiority but merely notes that the brand possesses them as a means to establish category POPs. Performance and imagery associations can provide supporting evidence. A cake mix might attain membership in the cake category by claiming the benefit of great taste and might support this benefit claim by possessing high-quality ingredients (performance) or by showing users delighting in its consumption (imagery).

### Exemplars.

Well-known, noteworthy brands in a category can also be used as exemplars to specify a brand’s category membership. When Tommy Hilfiger was an unknown designer, advertising announced his membership as a great American designer by associating him with Geoffrey Beene, Stanley Blacker, Calvin Klein, and Perry Ellis, who were recognized members of that category at that time. The National Pork Board successfully advertised for over two decades that pork was “the Other White Meat,” riding the coattails of the popularity of chicken in the process.<sup>44</sup>

### Product Descriptor.

The product descriptor that follows the brand name is often a very compact means of conveying category origin. For example, USAir changed its name to US Airways, according to CEO Stephen Wolf, as part of the airline’s attempted transformation from a regional carrier with a poor reputation to a strong national or even international brand. The argument was that other major airlines had the word *airlines* or *airways* in their names rather than *air*, which was felt to be typically associated with smaller, regional carriers.<sup>45</sup> Consider these two examples:

* When Campbell’s launched its V-8 Splash beverage line, it deliberately avoided including the word “carrot” in the brand name despite the fact that carrot was the main ingredient. The name was chosen to convey healthful benefits but to avoid the negative perception of carrots.<sup>46</sup>
* California’s prune growers and marketers have attempted to establish an alternative name for their product, “dried plums,” because prunes were seen by the target market of 35- to 50-year-old women as “a laxative for old people.”<sup>47</sup>

Establishing a brand’s category membership is usually not sufficient for effective brand positioning. If many firms engage in category-building tactics, the result may even be consumer confusion. For example, at the peak of the dot-com boom, Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Datek, and others advertised lower commission rates on stock trades than conventional brokerage firms.

Although carrots were a primary ingredient, the marketers of V8 Splash deliberately avoided invoking the vegetable in the brand name, given its sometimes negative connotations.
