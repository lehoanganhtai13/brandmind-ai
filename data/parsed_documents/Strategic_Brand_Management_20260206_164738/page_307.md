# BRANDING BRIEF 8-2

## Understanding and Managing the Mayo Clinic Brand

Mayo Clinic was founded in the late 1800s by Dr. William Worral Mayo and his two sons, who later pioneered the “group practice of medicine” by inviting other physicians to work with them in Rochester, Minnesota. The Mayos believed that “two heads are better than one, and three are even better.” From this beginning on the frontier, Mayo Clinic grew to be a worldwide leader in patient care, research, and education and became renowned for its world-class specialty care and medical research. In addition to the original facilities in Rochester, Mayo later built clinics in Jacksonville, Florida, and Scottsdale, Arizona, during the 1980s. More than 500,000 patients are cared for in Mayo’s inpatient and outpatient practice annually.

In 1996, Mayo undertook its first brand equity study and since then has conducted regular, national qualitative and quantitative studies. Mayo’s research identifies seven key brand attributes or values, including (1) integration, (2) integrity, (3) longevity, (4) exclusivity, (5) leadership, (6) wisdom, and (7) dedication. Although some of these values also characterize other high-quality medical centers, integration and integrity are more nearly unique to Mayo.

In terms of integration, respondents described Mayo as bringing together a wealth of resources to provide the best possible care. They perceived Mayo to be efficient, organized, harmonious, and creating a sense of participation and partnership. For example, one person described Mayo as “A well conducted symphony . . . works harmoniously . . . One person can’t do it alone . . . Teamwork, cooperation, compatibility.”

For integrity, respondents placed great value on the fact that Mayo is noncommercial and committed to health and healing over profit. One participant said, “The business element is taken out of Mayo. . . . Their ethics are higher . . . which gives me greater faith in their diagnosis.”

Although none of Mayo Clinic’s brand attributes are solely negative, perceptions of exclusivity pose some specific challenges. This attribute was sometimes described positively, in perceptions that Mayo offers the highest quality care and elite doctors, but inaccurate beliefs that it serves only the rich and famous and the sickest of the sick were emotionally distancing and made Mayo seem inaccessible.

In a more recent quantitative study, overall awareness of Mayo Clinic in the United States was 90.2 percent, and a remarkable one-third knew at least one Mayo patient. One of the key questions in the survey asked, “Suppose your health plan or personal finances permitted you to go anywhere in the U.S. for a serious medical condition which required highly specialized care, to which one institution would you prefer to go?” Mayo Clinic was the most popular choice, earning 18.6 percent of the responses, compared with 5.0 percent for the next most frequently mentioned medical center. Word-of-mouth has the most influence on these preferences for highly specialized medical care.

From its research, Mayo Clinic understands that its brand “is precious and powerful.” Mayo realized that while it had an overwhelmingly positive image, it was vital to develop guidelines to protect the brand. In 1999, the clinic created a brand management infrastructure to be the “institutional clearinghouse for ongoing knowledge about external perceptions of Mayo Clinic and its related activities.” Mayo Clinic also established guidelines for applying the brand to products and services. Its brand management measures work to ensure that the clinic preserves its brand equity, as well as allowing Mayo to continue to accomplish its mission:

> *To inspire hope and contribute to health and well-being by providing the best care to every patient through integrated clinical practice, education and research.*

**The Mayo Clinic knows the importance and value of its brand and carefully monitors and manages its image and equity.**
