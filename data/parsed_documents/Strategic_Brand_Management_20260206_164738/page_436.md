One key to its global success has been McDonald’s willingness to adapt its menu to different cultural preferences and regional tastes. The chain offers specialized menu items, such as the Teriyaki Burger in Japan and Vegetable McNuggets in England. In India—where beef is not consumed because cows are sacred—it introduced the Maharaja Mac, made from mutton. The company also developed spicy sauces, such as McMasala and McImli.  
McDonald’s targets different demographic and psychographic market segments as well. The product offerings in Happy Meals have been tweaked through the years to appeal to both children and their parents. More recently, McDonald’s sought to develop a new U.S. market by attracting twenty- and thirty-something females with premium salads served with Newman’s Own dressing, and other lighter menu options. McDonald’s rapidly became the number-one salad brand in the United States.

### Product Development  
McDonald’s found its popularity in its core markets under threat as international concern grew about the role of fast food in poor health and obesity, highlighted by the 2001 book *Fast Food Nation* and the 2004 movie *Super Size Me*, among other critiques. The company posted its first quarterly loss in 2002, and as a consequence, it “needed to look at why its customers weren’t buying and recognize that they wanted better choices and healthier options.”  
McDonald’s responded by overhauling its menu, removing “Super Size” options and adding healthier options such as a number of fresh salads, healthier versions of kids’ Happy Meals, and adult versions that included salad, bottled water, and a pedometer to encourage exercise. Other health initiatives the firm undertook included its Balanced Lifestyles platform for children, which promoted healthy food choices, education, and physical activity; and its Go Active! campaign to promote active lifestyles. Both were endorsed by Bob Greene, Oprah Winfrey’s personal trainer.  
The shift in focus toward healthy eating and physical activity was emphasized by McDonald’s recasting of Ronald McDonald as its “Chief Happiness Officer,” a sports enthusiast who donned a more athletic version of his traditional yellow-and-red clown suit and snowboarded, skateboarded, and juggled fruit in a new TV spot.  
The company also tapped into the growing premium-coffee trend in the United States by launching McDonald’s Premium Roast coffee, which retails for about 35 percent less than a cup of Starbucks coffee. McDonald’s also introduced a new line of premium hamburgers—one-third-of-a-pound Angus Burgers. The 20-piece Chicken McNuggets allowed the company to enter the shared-meals segment dominated by KFC.

### Diversification  
Although McDonald’s has largely focused on expansion through market penetration, market development, and product development, it has done some diversification to target new customers with new service offerings. It extended its brand in 2001 with the opening of its first domestic McCafé, a gourmet coffee shop inspired by the success of Starbucks that had debuted in Portugal and Austria. Another extension is McTreat, an ice cream and dessert shop.  
While several Golden Arch Hotels in Switzerland failed to make it and were sold off, experimentation continues. In Hong Kong, three McDonald’s locations offer wedding packages for loyal couples. The basic Warm and Sweet Wedding Package for 50 guests goes for under $1,300. An additional $165 covers a rented “gown” of pearly white balloons.

Despite such success stories, most new products are branded and launched as extensions. To understand why, we’ll next outline some of the main advantages and disadvantages of brand extensions.

# ADVANTAGES OF EXTENSIONS  
For most firms, the question is not *whether* to extend the brand, but when, where, and how to extend it. Well-planned and well-implemented extensions offer a number of advantages that we can broadly categorize as those that facilitate new-product acceptance and those that provide feedback benefits to the parent brand or company as whole (see Figure 12-2).
