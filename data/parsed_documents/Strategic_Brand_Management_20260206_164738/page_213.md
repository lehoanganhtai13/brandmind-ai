They have increased R&D expenditures to improve products and identify new product innovations, as was the case with Kimberly-Clark and its Kleenex brand.104

> Kleenex has dominated the facial tissue category for years, currently holding 46 percent market share. In recent years, with the economic downturn, more consumers are switching to less-expensive store brands as private labels in the category have increased quality to provide a more viable alternative. Kimberly-Clark—maker of Kleenex—chose to respond through product innovation. The average home purchases facial tissues about eight times a year and contains four boxes at any point in time. Increasingly, those boxes are not placed inside a decorative cover. Much of that is due to Kimberly-Clark’s innovative efforts to improve the design aesthetics of the Kleenex box. Oval-shaped packages and embossed wallpaper-like patterns have been introduced as well as seasonal offerings. An oval package with a pattern of Christmas lights was introduced that actually flickered when a tissue was taken out. To boost summer sales—when revenue typically drops by as much as 60 percent from the winter months—new packages were launched that resembled wedges of fruit such as watermelon, orange, and lime. Through all these packaging innovations, Kimberly-Clark hopes to keep Kleenex differentiated as the market leader.

Marketers of major brands have also increased advertising and promotion budgets. They have also tracked store-brand growth more closely than in the past and are competing on a market-by-market basis. Marketers of major brands have also adjusted their brand portfolios. They have eliminated stagnant brands and extensions and concentrated their efforts on smaller numbers of brands. They have introduced discount “fighter” brands that are specially designed and promoted to compete with private labels.

Marketers of major brands have also been more aggressive about legally protecting their brands. For example, Unilever filed suit against global supermarket giant Ahold alleging trademark and trade dress (the design and visual appearance of the product and package) infringement across four of its European margarine brands. Unilever also filed suit against Lipton iced tea and Bertolli olive oil, maintaining that their packaging looked too similar to its own brands.105

One controversial move by some marketers of major brands is to actually supply private-label makers. For example, Sara Lee, Del Monte, and Birds Eye have all supplied products—sometimes lower in quality—to be used for private labels in the past. Other marketers, however, criticize this “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” strategy, maintaining that these actions, if revealed, may create confusion or even reinforce a perception by consumers that all brands in a category are essentially the same.

### Future Developments

Many marketers feel that the brands most endangered by the rise of private labels are second-tier brands that have not been as successful at establishing a clear identity as market leaders have. For example, in the laundry detergent category, the success of a private-label brand such as Walmart’s Ultra Clean is more likely to come at the expense of brands such as Oxydol, All, or Fab rather than market leader Tide.

In Britain, one study showed that the average share of 52 leading brands measured fell only from 34.2 percent to 32.6 percent between 1975 and 1999—the “losers” were the smaller “trade dependent” brands that invest less in marketing and attempt to compete on price with private labels.106 Thus, highly priced, poorly differentiated and undersupported brands are especially vulnerable to private-label competition.

At the same time, if nothing else, retailers will need the quality and image that go along with well-researched, efficiently manufactured, and professionally marketed major brands, because of consumer demand. When A&P let store brands soar to 35 percent of its dry grocery sales mix in the 1960s, many shoppers defected, and the store was forced to drop the percentage to under 20 as a result. Similarly, Federated Department Stores, owner of private-label wizard Macy’s, has vowed to keep its percentage of revenue from private labels at under 20 percent.
