Firms introduce multiple brands because no one brand is viewed equally favorably by all the different distinct market segments the firm would like to target. Multiple brands allow a firm to pursue different price segments, different channels of distribution, different geographic boundaries, and so forth.⁶

In designing the optimal brand portfolio, marketers must first define the relevant customer segments. How much overlap exists across segments, and how well can products be cross-sold?⁷ Branding Brief 11-1 describes how Marriott has introduced different brands and sub-brands to attack different markets.

Other reasons for introducing multiple brands in a category include the following:⁸

* To increase shelf presence and retailer dependence in the store  
* To attract consumers seeking variety who may otherwise switch to another brand  
* To increase internal competition within the firm  
* To yield economies of scale in advertising, sales, merchandising, and physical distribution  

Marketers generally need to trade off market coverage and these other considerations with costs and profitability. A portfolio is too big if profits can be increased by dropping brands; it is not big enough if profits can be increased by adding brands. Brand lines with poorly differentiated brands are likely to be characterized by much cannibalization and require appropriate pruning.⁹

The basic principle in designing a brand portfolio is to *maximize market coverage* so that no potential customers are being ignored, but *minimize brand overlap* so that brands aren’t competing among themselves to gain the same customer’s approval. Each brand should have a distinct target market and positioning.¹⁰

For example, over the last 10 years or so, Procter & Gamble has sought to maximize market coverage and minimize brand overlap by pursuing organic growth from existing core brands rather than introducing a lot of new brands. The company has focused its innovation efforts on its core “billion dollar” brands—those with more than $1 billion in revenue. Numerous successful market-leading brand extensions followed, such as Crest whitening products, Pampers’ training diapers, and Mr. Clean Magic Eraser products.¹¹

Besides these considerations, brands can play a number of specific roles as part of a brand portfolio. Figure 11-3 summarizes some of them, which we review next.

**Flankers.** Certain brands act as protective flanker or “fighter” brands.¹² The purpose of flanker brands typically is to create stronger points-of-parity with competitors’ brands so that more important (and more profitable) flagship brands can retain their desired positioning. In particular, as we noted in Chapter 5, many firms are introducing discount brands as flankers, to better compete with store brands and private labels and to protect their higher-priced brand companions. In Australia, Qantas launched Jetstar airlines as a discount fighter brand to compete with the recently introduced low-priced Virgin Blue airlines—which was meeting with much success—and to protect its flagship premium Qantas brand.¹³

Figure 11-3 outlines nine potential special roles that brands can fulfill within a firm's overall brand portfolio. These roles are categorized by their strategic objectives, including market penetration and segment coverage, such as attracting specific market segments not currently served or acting as a low-end entry-level product to draw in new customers. The figure also highlights defensive and supportive functions, like serving as a flanker to protect flagship brands or increasing shelf presence and retailer dependence. Furthermore, it details roles focused on financial and operational efficiency, such as acting as a cash cow for profit generation or yielding economies of scale in various business functions. Finally, some roles are geared towards enhancing brand perception and internal dynamics, including serving as a high-end prestige product to bolster the portfolio's credibility and increasing internal competition to drive performance. In other cases, firms have repositioned existing brands in their portfolio to play that role.
