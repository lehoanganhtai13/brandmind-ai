BMW introduced certain models into its 3-series automobiles in part as a means of bringing new customers into its brand franchise, with the hope of moving them up to higher-priced models when they traded their cars in. As the 3-series gradually moved up-market, BMW introduced the 1-series in 2004, which was built on the same production line as the 3-series and priced between the 3-series and the MINI.

On the other hand, the role of a relatively high-priced brand in the brand family is often to add prestige and credibility to the entire portfolio. For example, one analyst argued that the real value to Chevrolet of its Corvette high-performance sports car was “its ability to lure curious customers into showrooms and at the same time help improve the image of other Chevrolet cars. It does not mean a hell of a lot for GM profitability, but there is no question that it is a traffic builder.”[^14] Corvette’s technological image and prestige cast a halo over the entire Chevrolet line.

**Summary.** Multiple brands can expand coverage, provide protection, extend an image, or fulfill a variety of other roles for the firm. In all brand portfolio decisions, the basic criteria are simple, even though their application can be quite complicated: to minimize overlap and get the most from the portfolio, each brand-name product must have (1) a well-defined role to fulfill for the firm and, thus, (2) a well-defined positioning indicating the benefits or promises it offers consumers. As Chapter 12 reveals, many firms find that due to product proliferation through the years, they now can cut the number of brands and product variants they offer and still profitably satisfy consumers.

# BRAND HIERARCHIES

A *brand hierarchy* is a useful means of graphically portraying a firm’s branding strategy by displaying the number and nature of common and distinctive brand elements across the firm’s products, revealing their explicit ordering. It’s based on the realization that we can brand a product in different ways depending on how many new and existing brand elements we use and how we combine them for any one product.

For example, a Dell Inspiron 17R notebook computer consists of three different brand name elements, “Dell,” “Inspiron,” and “17R.” Some of these may be shared by many different products; others are limited. Dell uses its corporate name to brand many of its products, but Inspiron designates a certain type of computer (portable), and 17R identifies a particular model of Inspiron (designed to maximize gaming performance and entertainment and including a 17-inch screen).

We can construct a hierarchy to represent how (if at all) products are nested with other products because of their common brand elements. Figure 11-5 displays a simple characterization of ESPN’s brand hierarchy. Note that ESPN is owned by Walt Disney Company and functions as a distinct family brand in that company’s brand portfolio. As the figure shows, a brand hierarchy can include multiple levels.

There are different ways to define brand elements and levels of the hierarchy. Perhaps the simplest representation from top to bottom might be:

1. Corporate or company brand (General Motors)  
2. Family brand (Buick)  
3. Individual brand (Regal)  
4. Modifier (designating item or model) (GS)  
5. Product description (midsize luxury sport sedan automobile)  

## Levels of a Brand Hierarchy

Different levels of the hierarchy have different issues, as we review in turn.

### Corporate or Company Brand Level.

The highest level of the hierarchy technically always consists of one brand—the *corporate or company brand*. For simplicity, we refer to corporate and company brands interchangeably, recognizing that consumers may not necessarily draw a distinction between the two or know that corporations may subsume multiple companies.
