This data presents a comparative analysis of successful and unsuccessful category extensions, illustrating how established brands have leveraged their equity in different ways. Successful extensions, such as Dove shampoo and conditioner, Vaseline Intensive Care skin lotion, and Hershey chocolate milk, demonstrate a strong alignment between the parent brand's core attributes and the new product category, often reinforcing existing brand perceptions of care, quality, or indulgence. Similarly, Visa traveler's checks and Arm and Hammer toothpaste highlight successful extensions into related functional areas. In contrast, unsuccessful extensions, including Campbell’s tomato sauce, LifeSavers chewing gum, and Harley-Davidson wine coolers, suggest a disconnect or dilution of the parent brand's identity, where the new product category does not resonate with the established brand image or perceived expertise. Examples like Ben-Gay aspirin and Kleenex diapers further underscore the risks of extending into unrelated or inappropriate product domains, potentially damaging brand equity.

*Examples of Category Extensions*

### Managerial Assumptions

To analyze potential consumer response to a brand extension, let’s start with a baseline case in which consumers are evaluating the brand extension based only on what they already know about the parent brand and the extension category, and before any advertising, promotion, or detailed product information is available. This baseline case provides the cleanest test of the extension concept itself, and it gives managers guidance about whether to proceed with an extension concept and, if so, what type of marketing program they might need.

Under these baseline conditions, we can expect consumers to use their existing brand knowledge, as well as what they know about the extension category, to try to infer what the extension product might be like. For these inferences to result in favorable evaluations of an extension, four basic conditions must generally hold true:

1. *Consumers have some awareness of and positive associations about the parent brand in memory.* Unless they have positive associations about the parent brand, consumers are unlikely to form favorable expectations of an extension.  
2. *At least some of these positive associations will be evoked by the brand extension.* A number of different factors will determine which parent brand associations are evoked, but in general, consumers are likely to infer associations similar in strength, favorability, and uniqueness to the parent brand when they see the brand extension as similar or close in fit to the parent.  
3. *Negative associations are not transferred from the parent brand.* Ideally, any negative associations that do exist for the parent brand will be left behind and not play a prominent role in consumers’ evaluation of the extension.  
4. *Negative associations are not created by the brand extension.* Finally, any parent-brand attributes or benefits that consumers view positively—or at least neutrally—must not be seen as negative for the extension. Consumers must also not infer any new attribute or benefit associations that did not characterize the parent brand but which they see as a potential drawback to the extension.

If any assumption does not hold true, problems can follow. Now we’ll examine some factors that influence the validity of these assumptions and consider in more detail how a brand extension, in turn, affects brand equity.

### Brand Extensions and Brand Equity

An extension’s ultimate success will depend on its ability to both achieve some of its own brand equity in the new category and contribute to the equity of the parent brand.
