brand associations. Many are likely to be shared by a majority of consumers, so we can refer to  
“the” brand image of Apple, but at the same time, we recognize that this image varies, perhaps  
even considerably, depending on the consumer or market segment.  

Other brands, of course, carry a different set of associations. For example, McDonald’s market-  
ing program attempts to create brand associations in consumers’ minds between its products and  
“quality,” “service,” “cleanliness,” and “value.” McDonald’s rich brand image probably also includes  
strong associations to “Ronald McDonald,” “golden arches,” “for kids,” and “convenient” as well as  
perhaps potentially negative associations such as “fast food.” Whereas Mercedes-Benz has achieved  
strong associations to “performance” and “status,” Volvo has created a strong association to “safety.”  
We’ll return in later chapters to the different types of associations and how to measure their strength.  

# SOURCES OF BRAND EQUITY  
What causes brand equity to exist? How do marketers create it? *Customer-based brand equity* oc-  
curs when the consumer has a high level of awareness and familiarity with the brand and holds  
_some strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in memory._ In some cases, brand awareness  
alone is enough to create favorable consumer response; for example, in low-involvement decisions when  
consumers are willing to base their choices on mere familiarity. In most other cases, however, the  
strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations play a critical role in determining the dif-  
ferential response that makes up brand equity. If customers perceive the brand as only representative  
of the product or service category, then they’ll respond as if the offering were unbranded.  

Thus marketers must also convince consumers that there are meaningful differences among brands.  
Consumers must not think all brands in the category are the same. Establishing a positive brand image in  
consumer memory—strong, favorable, and unique brand associations—goes hand-in-hand with creating  
brand awareness to build customer-based brand equity. Let’s look at both these sources of brand equity.  

## Brand Awareness  
Brand awareness consists of brand recognition and brand recall performance:  

* **Brand recognition** is consumers’ ability to confirm prior exposure to the brand when given  
  the brand as a cue. In other words, when they go to the store, will they be able to recognize  
  the brand as one to which they have already been exposed?  
* **Brand recall** is consumers’ ability to retrieve the brand from memory when given the product  
  category, the needs fulfilled by the category, or a purchase or usage situation as a cue. In other  
  words, consumers’ recall of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes will depend on their ability to retrieve the  
  brand when they think of the cereal category or of what they should eat for breakfast or a snack,  
  whether at the store when making a purchase or at home when deciding what to eat.
