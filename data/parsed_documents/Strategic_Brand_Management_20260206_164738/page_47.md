## UNICEF

UNICEF launched its “Tap Project” campaign in 2007, which asked diners to pay $1 for a glass of New York City tap water in restaurants, with the funds going to support the organization’s clean water programs. That was the first time UNICEF had run a consumer campaign in over 50 years. The UNICEF logo was featured on the Barcelona soccer team’s jersey from 2006 to 2011 under an arrangement in which the team donated $2 million annually to the organization. UNICEF launched another consumer campaign in the UK in February 2010. This five-year “Put it Right” campaign features celebrity ambassadors for the organization and aims to protect the rights of children. One of UNICEF’s most successful corporate relationships has been with IKEA. The partnership, which also emphasizes children’s rights, was established in 2000 and encompasses direct donations from IKEA and an annual toy campaign, the sales from which directly benefit UNICEF programs.[27]

By building awareness, image, and loyalty, these sports franchises are able to meet ticket sales targets regardless of what their team’s actual performance might turn out to be. Brand symbols and logos in particular have become an important financial contributor to professional sports through licensing agreements.

Branding plays an especially valuable function in the arts and entertainment industries that bring us movies, television, music, and books. These offerings are good examples of experience goods: prospective buyers cannot judge quality by inspection and must use cues such as the particular people involved, the concept or rationale behind the project, and word-of-mouth and critical reviews.

Think of a movie as a product whose “ingredients” are the plot, actors, and director.[28] Certain movie franchises such as *Spider Man*, *James Bond*, and *Twilight* have established themselves as strong brands by combining all these ingredients into a formula that appeals to consumers and allows the studios to release sequels (essentially brand extensions) that rely on the title’s initial popularity. For years, some of the most valuable movie franchises have featured recurring characters or ongoing stories, and many successful recent films have With its ability to transcend its original format—books—the *Harry Potter* film series has been likened to the *Star Wars* franchise.
