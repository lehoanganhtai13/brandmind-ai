The percentage of coupons consumers redeem dropped steadily for years—in part due to the clutter of coupons that were increasingly being distributed—before experiencing an uptick more recently: redemption rates peaked in 1992 but fell for the next 15 years until experiencing an increase in the tough economic climate of late 2008. Almost 90 percent of all coupons appear in free-standing inserts (FSIs) in Sunday newspapers.

One area of promotional growth is in-store coupons, which marketers have increasingly turned to given that their redemption rates far exceed those of traditional out-of-store coupons. Another growing area is digital coupons, whose redemption rate (6 percent) is the highest of all types of coupons and 10 times higher than for newspaper coupons. Groupon created a clever promotional scheme that has met with some apparent success; the firm also turned down a $6 billion purchase offer from Google in 2010.<sup>44</sup>

## GROUPON

Groupon launched in 2008 as a company offering a new marketing vehicle to businesses. By leveraging the Internet and e-mail, the company helps businesses use promotions as a form of advertisement. Specifically, Groupon maintains a large base of subscribers who receive a humorously worded daily deal—a specific percentage or dollar amount off the regular price—for a specific branded product or service. Through these e-mail discounts, Groupon offers three benefits to businesses: increased consumer exposure to the brand, the ability to price discriminate, and the creation of a “buzz factor.” For these benefits, Groupon takes a 40–50 percent cut in the process. Many promotions are offered on behalf of local retailers such as spas, fitness centers, and restaurants, but Groupon also manages deals on behalf of national brands such as Gap, Southwest Airlines, and FTD. In 2010, Groupon expanded from 1 to 35 countries, grew its subscriber base from 2 million to over 50 million, partnered with 58,000 local businesses to promote over 100,000 deals, and saved consumers over $1.5 billion. Although some businesses complain that Groupon just attracts deal-seekers and is not as effective in converting regular customers, its 2011 revenue was reported to be between $3 billion and $4 billion. Groupon now faces several competitors in the market it helped create, including LivingSocial, Bloomspot, and Buywithme. Partly in response, Groupon Now was launched. Leveraging its massive sales force to sell Groupon Now, Groupon enlists local businesses to offer time and location-specific deals that customers can obtain via the Web or their smartphone. The iPhone app for the new service has two buttons, “I’m Bored” and “I’m Hungry” to trigger possible deals in real time. For businesses, the service is a way to boost traffic at otherwise slow times. Even a popular restaurant might still consider some midday and midweek discounts knowing the place is rarely full then.

Groupon devised a completely new way to send timely promotions to consumers by digital means.
