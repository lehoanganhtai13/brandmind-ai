* Listen to your best customers: Suggestions and complaints from top customers deserve careful consideration, because they can lead to improvements in the program. Because they typically represent a large percentage of business, top customers must also receive better service and more attention.
* Engage people: Make customers want to join the program. Make the program easy to use and offer immediate rewards when customers sign up. Once they become members, make customers “feel special,” for example, by sending them birthday greetings, special offers, or invitations to special events.

### Summary

The product is at the heart of brand equity. Marketers must design, manufacture, market, sell, deliver, and service products in a way that creates a positive brand image with strong, favorable, and unique brand associations; elicits favorable judgments and feelings about the brand; and fosters greater degrees of brand resonance.

Product strategy entails choosing both tangible and intangible benefits the product will embody and marketing activities that consumers desire and the marketing program can deliver. A range of possible associations can become linked to the brand—some functional and performance-related, and some abstract and imagery-related. Perceived quality and perceived value are particularly important brand associations that often drive consumer decisions.

Because of the importance of loyal customers, relationship marketing has become a branding priority. Consequently, consumers’ actual product experiences and aftermarketing activities have taken on increased importance in building customer-based brand equity. Those marketers who will be most successful at building CBBE will take the necessary steps to make sure they fully understand their customers and how they can deliver superior value before, during, and after purchase. A company doing just that is Proton.

### PROTON

Proton, the first Malaysian national automobile manufacturer, has undertaken a number of activities to ensure customer loyalty, strengthen brand equity, and enhance its analytical and operational efficiency. These activities have included a campaign called “Power of 1” to communicate technological enhancements, the “Very Important Proton” (VIP) program to maintain customer loyalty, and a “Zero Defect Campaign.” Other activities include the establishment of a centralized logistics hub to manage sales, services, and warranties, and to encourage feedback from customers. Currently, the advertising campaign for its latest product, Proton Prevé, has the theme “Drive it to believe it.” Since its launch in April 2012, orders for the Prevé have reached more than 11,000 units. In addition, activities are being carried out to capture the after-sales segment in order to promote visits to Proton service centers, where better value-for-money packages have been introduced. This tactical campaign is performed every quarter to induce an element of surprise and enhance a “feel good” sentiment among Proton customers. Overall, performance of Proton is better than in 2010. Its market position for 2011 is only 5.2 percent behind Perodua, the Malaysia automobile leader.[42]
