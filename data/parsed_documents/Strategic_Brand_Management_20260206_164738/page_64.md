and trained to systematically handle accounts and seek out new businesses. Advertising combined more powerful creativity with more persuasive copy and slogans. Government and industry regulation came into place to reduce deceptive advertising. Marketing research became more important and influential in supporting marketing decisions.

Although functional management of brands had these virtues, it also presented problems. Because responsibility for any one brand was divided among two or more functional managers—as well as advertising specialists—poor coordination was always a potential problem. For example, the introduction of Wheaties cereal by General Mills was nearly sabotaged by the company’s salesmen, who were reluctant to take on new duties to support the brand. Three years after the cereal’s introduction and on the verge of its being dropped, a manager from the advertising department at General Mills decided to become a product champion for Wheaties, and the brand went on to great success in the following decades.

## Challenges to Manufacturer Brands: 1930 to 1945

The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 posed new challenges to manufacturer brands. Greater price sensitivity swung the pendulum of power in the favor of retailers who pushed their own brands and dropped nonperforming manufacturer brands. Advertising came under fire as manipulative, deceptive, and tasteless and was increasingly being ignored by certain segments of the population. In 1938, the Wheeler Amendment gave power to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to regulate advertising practices. In response to these trends, manufacturers’ advertising went beyond slogans and jingles to give consumers specific reasons why they should buy advertised products.

There were few dramatic changes in marketing of brands during this time. As a notable exception, Procter & Gamble put the first brand management system into place, whereby each of their brands had a manager assigned only to that brand who was responsible for its financial success. Other firms were slow to follow, however, and relied more on their long-standing reputation for good quality—and a lack of competition—to sustain sales. During World War II, manufacturer brands became relatively scarce as resources were diverted to the war effort. Nevertheless, many brands continued to advertise and helped bolster consumer demand during these tough times.

The Lanham Act of 1946 permitted federal registration of service marks (marks used to designate services rather than products) and collective marks such as union labels and club emblems.

## Establishment of Brand Management Standards: 1946 to 1985

After World War II, the pent-up demand for high-quality brands led to an explosion of sales. Personal income grew as the economy took off, and market demand intensified as the rate of population growth exploded. Demand for national brands soared, fueled by a burst of new products and a receptive and growing middle class. Firm after firm during this time period adopted the brand management system.

In the brand management system, a brand manager took “ownership” of a brand. A brand manager was responsible for developing and implementing the annual marketing plan for his or her brand, as well as identifying new business opportunities.

The brand manager might be assisted, internally, by representatives from manufacturing, the sales force, marketing research, financial planning, research and development, personnel, legal, and public relations and, externally, by representatives from advertising agencies, research suppliers, and public relations agencies.

Then, as now, a successful brand manager had to be a versatile jack-of-all-trades. The skills that began to be required then have only become more important now, including:

* Marketing fundamentals  
* Cultural insights to understand the diversity of consumers  
* IT and Web skills to guide digital activities  
* Technical sophistication to appreciate new research methods and models  
* Design fluency to work with design techniques and designers  
* Creativity to devise holistic solutions  

## Branding Becomes More Pervasive: 1986 to Now

The merger and acquisitions boom of the mid-1980s raised the interest of top executives and other board members as to the financial value of brands. With this realization came an appreciation of the importance of managing brands as valuable intangible assets. At the same time, more different types of firms began to see the advantages of having a strong brand and the corresponding disadvantages of having a weak brand.

The last 25 years have seen an explosion in the interest and application of branding as more firms have embraced the concept. As more and more different kinds of products are sold or promoted directly to consumers, the adoption of modern marketing practices and branding has spread further. Consider the pharmaceutical industry.

> ### THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
>
> In the United States, prescription drugs are increasingly being branded and sold to consumers with traditional marketing tactics such as advertising and promotion. Direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs also grew from $242 million in 1994 to $4.2 billion in 2010. In 2009, Pfizer spent over $1 billion in direct-to-consumer advertising. Much of this effort is focused on what we might call “disease branding,” in which marketers shape public impressions of a medical malady to make treating it more attractive to potential patients. Panic disorder, reflux disease, erectile dysfunction, and restless legs syndrome were all relatively obscure to the public until they were given a specific name and meaning by drug companies. By highlighting and destigmatizing medical conditions, disease branding increases demand for the drugs being sold for treatment. When Pharmacia launched Detrol, it labeled what physicians had been calling “urge incontinence” as an “overactive bladder,” a much more vigorous-sounding condition. Millions of prescriptions followed. Some pharmaceutical companies, however, are cutting back on direct-to-consumer advertising in light of the lower number of new-drug introductions and increasing government scrutiny of the practice. They are selective in deciding which brands to market directly to consumers; of over 2,000 drugs recently studied, only 100 were targeted via advertising to consumers.<sup>43</sup> Branding has become part of the everyday vernacular and it is not uncommon to hear people of all walks of life talk about branding and branding concepts.
