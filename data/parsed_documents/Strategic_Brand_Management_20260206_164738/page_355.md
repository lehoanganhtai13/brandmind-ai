# Four Pillars Assess Brand Health, Development, and Momentum

This table outlines four key components of brand equity and their associated outcomes. Energized Differentiation, defined as a brand's unique meaning with motion and direction, relates to margins and cultural currency. Relevance, representing how appropriate a brand is to a consumer, is linked to consideration and trial. Esteem, reflecting how a consumer regards a brand, is associated with loyalty. Finally, Knowledge, an intimate understanding of the brand, relates to brand saliency. The structure suggests a framework where distinct brand attributes drive specific consumer behaviors and perceptions, ultimately contributing to overall brand strength.

BAV represents a unique brand equity research tool. Unlike most conventional brand image surveys that adhere to a narrowly defined product category, respondents evaluate brands in a category-agnostic context. Brands are percentile ranked against *all* brands in the study for each brand metric. Thus, by comparing brands across as well as within categories, BAV is able to draw the broadest possible conclusions about how consumer-level brand equity is created and built—or lost. In the United States for the past 10 years, data has been collected quarterly from an 18,000-person panel, which enables the identification and analysis of short-term branding trends and phenomena.

## Four Pillars

There are four key components of brand health in BAV (see Figure 9-14). Each pillar is derived from various measures that relate to different aspects of consumers’ brand perceptions. Taken together, the four pillars trace the progression of a brand’s development.

* **Energized Differentiation** measures the degree to which a brand is seen as different from others, and captures the brand’s direction and momentum. This is a necessary condition for profitable brand building. It relates to pricing power and is often the key brand pillar in explaining valuation multiples like market value to sales.
* **Relevance** measures the appropriateness of the brand to consumers and the overall size of a brand’s potential franchise or penetration.
* **Esteem** measures how well the brand is regarded and respected—in short, how well it’s liked. Esteem is related to loyalty.
* **Knowledge** measures how intimately familiar consumers are with a brand, related to the saliency of the brand. Interestingly, high knowledge is inversely related to a brand’s potential.

## Relationship Among the Pillars

Examining the relationships between these four dimensions—a brand’s “pillar patterns”—reveals much about a brand’s current and future status (see Figure 9-15). It is not enough to look at each brand pillar in isolation; it is the relationships between the pillars that tell a story about brand health and opportunities. Here are some key relationships:

* When Energized Differentiation is greater than Relevance, the brand is standing out and receiving attention in the marketplace. It now has the potential to channel this point of difference and energy into building meaningfulness for consumers by driving Relevance.
* But if a brand is more Relevant than Differentiated, this suggests commoditization. While the brand is appropriate and meaningful within the lives of consumers, it is perceived as interchangeable with other players in the category. Therefore, consumers will not go out of their way for this brand, remain loyal to it, or pay a premium for it, since it lacks that special something we quantify as Energized Differentiation. Convenience, habit and price become drivers of brand choice in this scenario.
* Leadership brands are strong on both pillars, resulting in consumer passion as well as market penetration.

Brands often strive to build awareness, but if the brand’s pillars are not in the proper alignment, then consumer knowledge of a brand becomes an obstacle that may need to be surmounted before the brand can continue to build healthy momentum.

* When a brand’s Esteem is greater than its Knowledge, this tells us that consumers like what they know about the brand so far, and typically want to find out more, suggesting growth potential.
* But if brand Knowledge is greater than Esteem, then consumers feel that they know more than enough about the brand and they are not interested in getting to know it any better. In this case, Knowledge is an impediment that the brand must try to overcome if it wishes to attract more consumers.
