This chapter considers the third means of building brand equity—namely, through the leverage of related or secondary brand associations.

Brands themselves may be linked to other entities that have their own knowledge structures in the minds of consumers. Because of these linkages, consumers may assume or infer that some of the associations or responses that characterize the other entities may also be true for the brand. In effect, the brand “borrows” some brand knowledge and, depending on the nature of those associations and responses, perhaps some brand equity from other entities.

This indirect approach to building brand equity is *leveraging secondary brand associations* for the brand. Secondary brand associations may be quite important to creating strong, favorable, and unique associations or positive responses if existing brand associations or responses are deficient in some way. It can also be an effective way to reinforce existing associations and responses in a fresh and different way.

This chapter considers the different means by which we can leverage secondary brand associations by linking the brand to the following (see Figure 7-1 for a fuller depiction):

1. **Companies** (through branding strategies)  
2. **Countries or other geographic areas** (through identification of product origin)  
3. **Channels of distribution** (through channel strategy)  
4. **Other brands** (through co-branding)  
5. **Characters** (through licensing)  
6. **Spokespersons** (through endorsements)  
7. **Events** (through sponsorship)  
8. **Other third-party sources** (through awards or reviews)  

The first three entities reflect source factors: who makes the product, where the product is made, and where it is purchased. The remaining entities deal with related people, places, or things.

As an example, suppose that Salomon—makers of alpine and cross-country ski bindings, ski boots, and skis—decided to introduce a new tennis racquet called “the Avenger.” Although Salomon has been selling safety bindings for skis since 1947, much of its growth was fueled by its diversification into ski boots and the introduction of a revolutionary new type of ski called the Monocoque in 1990. Salomon’s innovative, stylish, and top-quality products have led to strong leadership positions.

This table outlines the components of brand equity, categorizing them into "Ingredients" and "Extensions" that contribute to a "Company's" overall brand. Under "Ingredients," key elements include "Alliances" with "Other Brands," "Employees" (representing "People"), "Endorsers," and tangible "Things." These are further detailed by specific examples like "Events" and "Causes." The "Extensions" category encompasses elements that broaden the brand's reach and perception, such as "Country of origin" and distribution "Channels." The structure highlights how internal and external factors, including relationships with other entities and the people involved, collectively build and extend a brand's value.
