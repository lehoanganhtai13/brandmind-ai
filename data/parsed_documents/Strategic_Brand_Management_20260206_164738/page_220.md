# THE NEW MEDIA ENVIRONMENT

According to the customer-based brand equity model, marketing communications can contribute to brand equity in a number of different ways: by creating awareness of the brand; linking points-of-parity and points-of-difference associations to the brand in consumers’ memory; eliciting positive brand judgments or feelings; and facilitating a stronger consumer–brand connection and brand resonance. In addition to forming the desired brand knowledge structures, marketing communication programs can provide incentives eliciting the differential response that makes up customer-based brand equity.

The flexibility of marketing communications comes in part from the number of different ways they can contribute to brand equity. At the same time, brand equity helps marketers determine how to design and implement different marketing communication options. In this chapter, we consider how to develop marketing communication programs to build brand equity. We will assume the other elements of the marketing program have been properly put into place. Thus, the optimal brand positioning has been defined—especially in terms of the desired target market—and product, pricing, distribution, and other marketing program decisions have largely been made.

Complicating the picture for marketing communications programs, however, is that fact that the media environment has changed dramatically in recent years. Traditional advertising media such as TV, radio, magazines, and newspapers seem to be losing their grip on consumers due to increased competition for consumer attention. The digital revolution offers a host of new ways for consumers to learn and talk about brands with companies or with each other.

This changing media landscape has forced marketers to reevaluate how they should best communicate with consumers.<sup>2</sup> Consider how Hyundai defied convention in launching its latest models and strengthened its brand and generated customer loyalty by integrating social media.

## HYUNDAI DRIVES SOCIAL MEDIA

The South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai offers quality cars with a “sexy” design, positioning the Hyundai brand as an affordable premium product. Social media marketing was first used in 2009 during the global financial crisis to promote Hyundai’s Assurance Program (if unemployed, one could simply return the car) on Facebook and Twitter. In 2010, Hyundai launched its “Uncensored” campaign, putting unscripted and unedited remarks of drivers testing Hyundai cars on YouTube. This resulted in thousands of hits, in tandem with traditional digital, radio, and point-of-sale promotions. The underlying concept of Hyundai’s approach was that consumers are most influenced by other consumers. Hyundai’s strategy has not been to challenge General Motors, Toyota, or Volkswagen for global sales leadership, but to focus on brand building. In 2012, the Veloster was launched with a repeat of the “Uncensored” campaign, resulting in a global demand that exceeded production capacity. The asymmetrical coupe initially targeted at those under 25 was an instant global success with buyers aged 17 to 70. This success contributes to Hyundai’s credibility with driving enthusiasts. In line with promotion campaigns, Hyundai’s “aftermarket” is now also managed via social media, where Hyundai owners find information about modifying vehicles and additional features on Twitter and Facebook “Fan Pages,” with live updated news and shared, unfiltered information.<sup>3</sup>

# Challenges in Designing Brand-Building Communications

The new media environment has further complicated marketers’ perennial challenge to build effective and efficient marketing communication programs. The Hyundai example illustrates the creativity and scope of what will characterize successful twenty-first century marketing communication programs. Skillfully designed and implemented marketing communications programs require careful planning and a creative knack. Let’s first consider a few useful tools to provide some perspective.

Perhaps the simplest—but most useful—way to judge any communication option is by its ability to contribute to brand equity. For example, how well does a proposed ad campaign contribute to brand awareness or to creating, maintaining, or strengthening certain brand associations? Does a sponsorship cause consumers to have more favorable brand judgments and feelings? To what extent does an online promotion encourage consumers to buy more of a product? At what price premium? Figure 6-2 displays a simple three-step model for judging the effectiveness of advertising or any communication option to build brand equity.
