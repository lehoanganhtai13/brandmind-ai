## Comparison Tasks

Another useful technique is comparison tasks, in which we ask consumers to convey their impressions by comparing brands to people, countries, animals, activities, fabrics, occupations, cars, magazines, vegetables, nationalities, or even other brands.¹³ For example, we might ask consumers, “If Dannon yogurt were a car, which one would it be? If it were an animal, which one might it be? Looking at the people depicted in these pictures, which ones do you think would be most likely to eat Dannon yogurt?” In each case, we would ask a follow-up question about why subjects made the comparison they did. The objects people choose to represent the brand and their reasons can provide glimpses into the psyche of the consumer with respect to a brand, particularly useful in understanding imagery associations.

By examining the answers to probes, researchers may be better able to assemble a rich image for the brand, for example, identifying key brand personality associations. Branding Brief 9-3 outlines how Gordon Ramsay actively courts media and controversy to create interest and excitement in Gordon Ramsay the brand, projected onto his restaurants worldwide.

## Archetypes

Archetype research is one technique for eliciting deeply held consumer attitudes and feelings. According to cultural anthropologist G. C. Rapaille, consumers often make purchase decisions based on factors of which they are only subconsciously aware. Conventional market research typically does not uncover these motivations, so Rapaille employs the archetype research technique to find them.¹⁴

Rapaille believes children experience a significant initial exposure to an element of their world called the “imprinting moment.” The pattern that emerges when we generalize these imprinting moments for the entire population is the *archetype*, a fundamental psychological association, shared by the members of the culture, with a given cultural object. Different cultures have dramatically different archetypes for the same objects. In France, the archetype for cheese is “alive” because age is its most important trait. By contrast, the U.S. archetype for cheese is “dead”; it is wrapped in plastic (“a body-bag”), put in the refrigerator (“a morgue”), and pasteurized (“scientifically dead”).

Rapaille uses relaxation exercises and visualization with consumers to find the imprinting moments appropriate to the product he is researching. For example, at a focus group, he will dim the lights, play soothing music, and coax the subjects into a meditative state. He will then elicit stories about the product from the subjects and analyze these stories to illuminate the archetype.

## Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique

One interesting approach to better understand how consumers view brands is the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET).¹⁵ ZMET is based on a belief that consumers often have subconscious motives for their purchasing behavior. “A lot goes on in our minds that we’re not aware of,” said former Harvard Business School professor Gerald Zaltman. “Most of what influences what we say and do occurs below the level of awareness. That’s why we need new techniques to get at hidden knowledge—to get at what people don’t know they know.”

To access this hidden knowledge, he developed the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique. As described in its U.S. patent, ZMET is “a technique for eliciting interconnected constructs that influence thought and behavior.” The word *construct* refers to “an abstraction created by the researcher to capture common ideas, concepts, or themes expressed by customers.” For example, the construct “ease of use” might capture the statements “simple to operate,” “works without hassle,” and “you don’t really have to do anything.”

ZMET stems from knowledge and research from varied fields such as “cognitive neuroscience, neurobiology, art critique, literary criticism, visual anthropology, visual sociology, semiotics . . . art therapy, and psycholinguistics.” The technique is based on the idea that “most social communication is nonverbal” and, as a result, approximately two-thirds of all stimuli received by the brain are visual. Using ZMET, Zaltman teases out consumers’ hidden thoughts and feelings about a particular topic, which often can be expressed best using metaphors.

Zaltman defines a metaphor as “a definition of one thing in terms of another, [which] people can use . . . to represent thoughts that are tacit, implicit, and unspoken.” ZMET focuses on surface, thematic, and deep metaphors. Some common deep metaphors include “transformation,” “container,” “journey,” “connection,” and “sacred and profane.”

A ZMET study starts with a group of participants who are asked in advance to think about the research topic at hand and collect a set of images from their own sources (magazines, catalogs, and family photo albums) that represent their thoughts and feelings about the research topic. The participants bring these images with them for a personal one-on-one two-hour interview.
