Figure 12-2 outlines the advantages of brand extension, categorized into two primary areas: facilitating new product acceptance and providing feedback benefits to the parent brand and company. For new product acceptance, brand extensions can improve brand image, reduce customer-perceived risk, and increase the likelihood of gaining distribution and trial. They also enhance the efficiency of promotional expenditures and reduce the costs associated with introductory and follow-up marketing programs, while avoiding the expense of developing an entirely new brand. Furthermore, brand extensions can lead to packaging and labeling efficiencies and cater to consumer variety-seeking behavior. In terms of feedback benefits, extensions can clarify brand meaning, enhance the parent brand image, attract new customers to broaden market coverage, and revitalize the brand, ultimately permitting subsequent extensions.

## Facilitate New-Product Acceptance

The high failure rate of new products has been well documented. Marketing analysts estimate that only 2 of 10 new products will be successful, or maybe even as few as 1 of 10. Brand extensions can certainly suffer some of the same shortcomings as any new product. Nevertheless, a new product introduced as a brand extension may be more likely to succeed, at least to some degree, because the advantages we describe below work to increase acceptance.

### Improve Brand Image.

As we saw in Chapter 2, one of the advantages of a well-known and well-liked brand is that consumers form expectations of its performance over time. They can form similar inferences and expectations about the likely composition and performance of a brand extension, based on what they already know about the brand itself and the extent to which they feel this information is relevant to the new product. [7]

These inferences may improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of the extension’s brand associations. For example, when Sony first introduced its laptop and personal computer tailored for multimedia applications, Vaio, consumers may have been more likely to feel comfortable with its anticipated performance because of their experience with and knowledge of other Sony products than if Sony had branded it as something completely new.

### Reduce Risk Perceived by Customers.

One research study found that the most important factor for predicting initial trial of a new product was the extent to which it connected to a known family brand. [8] Extensions from well-known corporate brands such as General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, or others may communicate longevity and sustainability. Although corporate brands can lack specific product associations because of the breadth of products attached to their name, their established reputation for introducing high-quality products and standing behind them may be an important risk-reducer for consumers. [9]

Perceptions of corporate credibility — in terms of the firm’s expertise and trustworthiness — can be valuable associations in introducing brand extensions. [10] Similarly, although widely extended supermarket family brands such as Betty Crocker, Green Giant, Del Monte, and Pepperidge Farm may lack specific product meaning, they may still stand for product quality in the minds of consumers and, by reducing perceived risk, facilitate the adoption of brand extensions.

### Increase the Probability of Gaining Distribution and Trial.

The potential for increased consumer demand for a new product introduced as an extension may convince retailers to stock and promote it. One study indicated that brand reputation was a key screening criteria of gatekeepers making new-product decisions at supermarkets. [11] From a marketing communications perspective, one obvious advantage of introducing a new product as a brand extension is that the introductory campaign does not have to create awareness of both the brand and the new product but instead can concentrate on only the new product itself.
