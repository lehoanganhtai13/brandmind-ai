## HARRY POTTER

All seven of the popular novels have been turned into blockbuster movies, generating over $7.7 billion worldwide by the end of 2011. In the first year it launched Harry Potter toys, Mattel saw $160 million in sales. And in 2010, Universal Studios opened a Florida theme park based on the Harry Potter stories. The Harry Potter empire has been praised for its attention to core marketing techniques—a good product, emotional involvement of its consumers, word-of-mouth promotion, “tease” marketing, and brand consistency. Several estimates have pegged the Harry Potter brand to be worth $15 billion, which, beyond the movies and the books, included more than $1 billion in DVD sales, nearly $12 million in licensing, and $13 million in music sales related to the films.29

Few brands have generated as much worldwide consumer loyalty—and profits—as Harry Potter.

A strong brand is valuable in the entertainment industry because of the fervent feelings that names generate as a result of pleasurable past experiences. A new album release from Neil Finn would probably not cause much of a ripple in the marketplace, even if it were marketed as coming from a founding member of the band Crowded House. If it were to actually be released and marketed under the Crowded House name, however, greater media attention and higher sales would be virtually guaranteed.
