This data presents a comparative analysis of brand stature over time, visualized as a scatter plot with lines indicating trends. The x-axis represents Brand Strength, broken down into Differentiation (e_DIF) and Relevance (REL), each scaled from 0 to 100. The y-axis represents Brand Stature, encompassing Esteem (EST) and Knowledge (KNO), also scaled from 0 to 100. The plot tracks the trajectory of two brands, Google (represented by a green line) and AOL (represented by a blue line), from 2001 to 2010. Specific data points are indicated by year markers, showing Google's progression from lower differentiation and relevance in 2001 to higher levels by 2006-2008, while AOL's path shows a different pattern with a peak in 2005 and subsequent decline. The overall structure is a time-series comparison of brand positioning on a two-dimensional matrix of brand strength and brand stature.

# Key Category Factors and Factor and Attribute Percentile Rank

This table presents a comparative analysis of Google's performance against competitors across four key brand perception categories: CUTTING EDGE, BOLD, DEPENDABLE, and SUPERIOR. Each category, with its associated sub-attributes, is evaluated using percentile ranks, indicating how well the brand is perceived on these factors. The CUTTING EDGE category, which drives Differentiation (DIF) and Energy (ENE), shows Google outperforming competitors in overall "CUTTING EDGE" perception, as well as in "Innovative" and "Visionary" attributes, though "Progressive" scores are closer. The BOLD category, also driving ENE, reveals Google leading in "BOLD" perception, "Fun," "Dynamic," and "Social" attributes. The DEPENDABLE category, driving Reliability (REL), demonstrates Google's strong performance across "DEPENDABLE" perception, "Reliable," "Intelligent," and "Trustworthy" attributes. Finally, the SUPERIOR category, driving REL and Esteem (EST), shows Google leading in "SUPERIOR" perception, "Best Brand," and "Leader" attributes, with a notable exception in "Worth More" where competitors score higher.
