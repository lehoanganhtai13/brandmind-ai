# TROPICANA

Consumers should at least recognize the Tropicana brand when it is presented to them. Beyond that, consumers should think of Tropicana whenever they think of orange juice, particularly when they are considering buying orange juice. Ideally, consumers would think of Tropicana whenever they were deciding which type of beverage to drink, especially when seeking a “tasty but healthy” beverage. Thus, consumers must think of Tropicana as satisfying a certain set of needs whenever those needs arise. One of the challenges for any provider of orange juice is to link the product to usage situations beyond the traditional one of breakfast—hence the industry campaign to boost consumption of Florida orange juice that used the slogan “It’s Not Just for Breakfast Anymore.”

NO PULP, Tropicana, PURE PREMIUM, 100% PURE FLORIDA, NEVER FROM CONCENTRATE.

## Product Category Structure

As the Tropicana example suggests, to fully understand brand recall, we need to appreciate *product category structure*, or how product categories are organized in memory. Typically, marketers assume that products are grouped at varying levels of specificity and can be organized in a hierarchical fashion.² Thus, in consumers’ minds, a product hierarchy often exists, with product class information at the highest level, product category information at the second-highest level, product type information at the next level, and brand information at the lowest level.

The beverage market provides a good setting to examine issues in category structure and the effects of brand awareness on brand equity. Figure 3-3 illustrates one hierarchy that might exist in consumers’ minds. According to this representation, consumers first distinguish between flavored and nonflavored beverages (water). Next, they distinguish between nonalcoholic and alcoholic flavored beverages. They further distinguish nonalcoholic beverages into hot drinks like coffee or tea, and cold drinks like milk, juices, and soft drinks. Alcoholic beverages are distinguished by whether they are wine, beer, or distilled spirits. We can make even further distinctions. For example, we can divide the beer category into no-alcohol, low-alcohol (or “light”), and full-strength beers, and divide full-strength beers by variety (ale or lager), by brewing method (draft, ice, or dry), by price and quality (discount, premium, or super-premium), and so on.
