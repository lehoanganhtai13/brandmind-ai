Nevertheless, some customers inevitably leave the brand franchise—even if only from natural causes. Thus firms must proactively develop strategies to attract new customers, especially younger ones. The marketing challenge here, however, often lies in making a brand seem relevant to vastly different generations and cohort groups or lifestyles. The challenge is greater when the brand has a strong personality or user image associations that tie it to one particular consumer group.

Unfortunately, even as younger consumers age, there is no guarantee they will have the same attitudes and behaviors as the older consumers who preceded them. In 2011, the first wave of post–World War II baby boomers celebrated their 65th birthdays and officially entered the senior citizen market. Many experts forecast that this group will insist companies embrace their own unique values in marketing products and services. As one demographic expert says, “Nothing could be further from the truth than saying boomers will be like their parents.”

The response to the challenge of marketing across generations and cohort groups has taken all forms. Some marketers have attempted to cut loose from the past, as Tommy Hilfiger did by renouncing the urban styles it had come to embody in the 1990s. Other brands have attempted to develop more inclusive marketing strategies to encompass both new and old customers. For example, Brooks Brothers has worked hard to upgrade its merchandise mix, renovate its fleet of stores, expand the franchise into overseas markets, and introduce its first designer label, Black Fleece, to retain the loyalty of older customers but attract new, younger customers at the same time. The company also engaged in an exclusive partnership with Nordstrom to sell a selected set of its more contemporary offerings.<sup>26</sup>

### Retiring Brands

Because of dramatic or adverse changes in the marketing environment, some brands are just not worth saving. Their sources of brand equity may have essentially dried up, or, even worse, damaging and difficult-to-change new associations may have been created. At some point, the size of the brand franchise—no matter how loyal—fails to justify support. In the face of such adversity, decisive management actions are necessary to properly retire or milk the brand.

Several options are possible. A first step in retrenching a fading brand is to reduce the number of its product types (package sizes or variations). Such actions reduce the cost of supporting the brand and allow it to put its best foot forward so it can more easily hit profit targets. If a sufficiently large and loyal enough customer base exists, eliminating marketing support can be a means to milk or harvest profits from these cash cows.

An *orphan brand* is a once-popular brand with diminished equity that a parent company allows to decline by withdrawing marketing support. Typically, these orphan brands have a As proof there can be some marketplace life left in seemingly dead brands, Memorex has been reinvented as a broader technology brand.
