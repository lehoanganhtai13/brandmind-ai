# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 11-2

## Capitalizing on Brand Potential

All you can ask of a brand is that it reaches its potential. The brand’s long-term brand value depends on how well a firm understands and recognizes its potential and capitalizes on it in the marketplace. Let’s consider all the different aspects of how long-term brand value gets created. See Figure 11-2 for a schematic summary.

### Processes Affecting Long-Term Brand Value

Long-term brand value depends on two basic processes: brand vision (the ability to see the brand’s inherent potential) and brand actualization (the ability to actually capitalize on the brand’s potential to derive maximum revenue).

**Brand Vision.** Brand vision requires defining the potential of a brand. *Inherent brand potential* is the value we could extract from a brand via optimally designed marketing strategies, programs, and activities. In other words, it reflects what brand value *could* become if, for example, we introduce different products, enter new markets, and appeal to different customers in the future. There are many different ways to expand a brand across products and markets.

Brand potential is in effect the “option value” of a brand if we recognize and capitalize on its assets. For publicly traded companies, it manifests itself in the premium a stock commands over the value explainable from cash flows in its current businesses. Viewed this way, acquiring a brand makes sense and will bring a positive return only if the acquiring firm has a better vision or ability to execute than the prior owners.

**Brand Actualization.** While brand vision means understanding the brand’s inherent potential, *brand actualization* means achieving that potential. Not surprisingly, due to differences in firm resources and management skill, firms vary in their ability to formulate a vision of what brand potential is and then capitalize on it to activate the brand’s inherent brand potential.

### Components of Long-Term Brand Value

Brand actualization (or potential actualization) depends on how successfully a firm can translate brand potential into the two key components of long-term brand value: brand persistence and brand growth.

This diagram illustrates a hierarchical model of brand equity development, progressing from foundational elements to ultimate value. At the base, "Current Brand Equity" is influenced by both the "Environment" and "Firm Behaviors," which together shape the "Inherent Brand Potential." This potential then informs the "BRAND VISION," which is subsequently realized through "BRAND ACTUALIZATION." The actualization phase encompasses "Brand Persistence" and "Brand Growth," leading to "BRAND VALUATION." The culmination of this process is "Long-Term Brand Value." The structure depicts a sequential flow where external and internal factors contribute to potential, which is then translated into a strategic vision, operationalized through persistence and growth, and finally quantified as enduring value.
