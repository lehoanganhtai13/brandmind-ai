One danger in licensing is that manufacturers can get caught up in licensing a brand that might be popular at the moment but is only a fad and produces short-lived sales. Because of multiple licensing arrangements, licensed entities can also easily become overexposed and wear out quickly as a result. Sales of Izod Lacoste, with its familiar alligator crest, peaked at $450 million in 1982 but dwindled to an estimated $150 million in shirt sales in 1990 after the brand became overexposed and discount priced.33 Subsequently purchased by Phillips-Van Heusen, the brand has been making a comeback as the result of more careful marketing.

Firms are taking a number of steps to protect themselves in their licensing agreements, especially those firms that have little brand equity of their own and rely on the image of their licensor.34 For example, firms are obtaining licensing rights to a broad range of licensed entities—some of which are more durable—to diversify their risk. Licensees are developing unique new products and sales and marketing approaches so that their sales are not merely a function of the popularity of other brands. Some firms conduct marketing research to ensure the proper match of product and licensed entity or to provide more precise sales forecasts for effective inventory management.

**Corporate trademark licensing** is the licensing of company names, logos, or brands for use on various, often unrelated products. For example, in the depths of a financial crisis a number of years ago, Harley-Davidson chose to license its name—synonymous with motorcycles and a certain lifestyle—to a polo shirt, a gold ring, and even a wine cooler. Once it regained firmer financial footing, the company developed a much more concerted strategy, meeting with much success as described in its 10K report in 2011.

> The Company creates an awareness of the Harley-Davidson brand among its customers and the non-riding public through a wide range of products for enthusiasts by licensing the name “Harley-Davidson” and other trademarks owned by the Company. The Company’s licensed products include t-shirts, vehicles and vehicle accessories, jewelry, small leather goods, toys and numerous other products. Although the majority of licensing activity occurs in the U.S., the Company continues to expand these activities in international markets. Royalty revenues from licensing, included in Motorcycles segment net revenue, were $39.8 million, $38.3 million and $45.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other seemingly narrowly focused brands such as Jeep, Caterpillar, Deere, and Jack Daniels have also entered a broad portfolio of licensing arrangements.

In licensing their corporate trademarks, firms may have different motivations, including generating extra revenues and profits, protecting their trademarks, increasing their brand exposure, or enhancing their brand image. The profit appeal can be enticing because there are no inventory expenses, accounts receivables, or manufacturing expenses. In an average deal, a licensee pays a corporation a royalty of about 5 percent of the wholesale price of each product, although the actual percentage can vary from 2 percent to 10 percent. As noted in Chapter 5, some firms now sell licensed merchandise through their own catalogs.

As in any co-branded arrangement, however, the risk is that the product will not live up to the reputation established by the brand. Inappropriate licensing can dilute brand meaning with consumers and marketing focus within the organization. Consumers don’t care about the financial arrangements behind a particular product or service; if the brand is used, the brand promise must be upheld.

## CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT

Using well-known and admired people to promote products is a widespread phenomenon with a long marketing history. Even the late U.S. president Ronald Reagan was a celebrity endorser, pitching several different products, including cigarettes, during his acting days. Some U.S. actors or actresses who refuse to endorse products in the United States are willing to do so in overseas markets. For example, rugged American actors Arnold Schwarzenegger (Bwain drink), Brad Pitt (Softbank), and Harrison Ford (Kirin beer) have all done ads for brands in Japan. Although Millward Brown estimates that celebrities show up in 15 percent of U.S. ads, that number jumps to 24 percent for India and 45 percent for Taiwan.35 The rationale behind these strategies is that a famous person can draw attention to a brand and shape the perceptions of the brand, by virtue of the inferences that consumers make based on the knowledge they have about the famous person.
