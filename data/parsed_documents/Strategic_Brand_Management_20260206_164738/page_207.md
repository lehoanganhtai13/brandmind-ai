Primarily, they are a means to showcase the brand and all its different product varieties in a manner not easily achieved through normal retail channels. For example, Nike might find its products spread all through department stores and athletic specialty stores. These products may not be displayed in a logical, coordinated fashion, and certain product lines may not even be stocked. By opening its own stores, Nike was able to effectively put its best foot forward by showing the depth, breadth, and variety of its branded products. Company stores can provide the added benefit of functioning as a test market to gauge consumer response to alternative product designs, presentations, and prices, allowing firms to keep their fingers on the pulse of consumers’ shopping habits.

A disadvantage of company stores is that some companies lack the skills, resources, or contacts to operate effectively as a retailer. For example, The Disney Store, started in 1987, sells exclusive Disney-branded merchandise, ranging from toys and videos to collectibles and clothing, priced from $3 to $3,000. Disney views the stores as an extension of the “Disney experience,” referring to customers as “guests” and employees as “cast members,” just as it did in its theme parks. The company has struggled, however, to find the right retail formula through the years, even selling the chain of stores in Japan and North America to a set of other companies before eventually buying them back.

Another issue with company stores, of course, is potential conflict with existing retail channels and distributors. In many cases, however, company stores can be a means of bolstering brand image and building brand equity rather than as direct sales devices. For example, Nike views its stores as essentially advertisements and tourist attractions. The company reports that research studies have confirmed that Niketown stores enhanced the Nike brand image by presenting the full scope of its sports and fitness lines to customers and “educating them” on the value, quality, and benefits of Nike products. The research also revealed that although only about 25 percent of visitors actually made a purchase at a Niketown store, 40 percent of those who did not buy during their visit eventually purchased Nike products from some other retailer.

These manufacturer-owned stores can also be seen as a means of hedging bets with retailers who continue to push their own labels. With one of its main distributors, JCPenney, pushing its own Arizona brand of jeans, Levi’s can protect its brand franchise to some extent by

## Goodyear’s Partnering Lessons

Goodyear is a good example of some of the challenges in managing channel conflict, having had to work hard to recover from missteps it took with the middlemen it uses to distribute its tires. A well-respected brand that once managed the top tire reseller network in the United States, Goodyear earned dealer loyalty in the 1970s and 1980s through competitive pricing, on-time deliveries, and very visible marketing in the form of the Goodyear blimp.

Subsequent years produced a number of problems. Goodyear managed to damage its own reputation through its apparent indifference to the distributors who sold its products. The company’s prices varied from month to month, and when distributors ordered tires, often only 50 percent of their order would be filled. Distributors nationwide said it was just getting hard to do business with Goodyear and many began hawking other brands instead.

Goodyear announced a distribution deal with Sears, even though the company had previously promised dealers that it would not sell tires through discount retailers, and then made similar deals with Walmart and Sam’s Club. To increase sales, the company began to offer the big retailers bulk discounts. As a result, smaller individually owned dealers had to pay as much for their tires as customers could pay at other retailers.

Shortly after Firestone was forced to recall 6.5 million tires in 2000, Goodyear management annoyed many of its distributors instead of taking advantage of its competitor’s legal and image problems. Goodyear dealership owners complained of pressure to buy more tires than they needed, uneven pricing, and poor quality. At that time, Goodyear had 5,300 authorized dealers, about the same number it had had since 1994. While overall U.S. tire sales grew during that time, Goodyear’s replacement tire sales slumped 14 percent, representing a loss of about $550 million in sales.

Goodyear has taken a number of steps in trying to win back its dealers since that time, including originally selling its popular Assurance tires exclusively through authorized dealers. Recent Goodyear price hikes, however, have forced dealers to take lower profits in selling its tires.
