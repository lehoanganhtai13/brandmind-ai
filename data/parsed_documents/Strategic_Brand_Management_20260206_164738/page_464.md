Perhaps the most extreme examples are brands that lost their trademark distinctiveness and became a generic term for the category, such as Thermos and Kleenex. To illustrate the difficulty a prototypical brand may have in extending, consider the experiences of Clorox.

## CLOROX

Clorox is a well-known brand whose name is virtually synonymous with bleach. In 1988, Clorox took on consumer goods giants Procter & Gamble and Unilever by introducing the first bleach with detergent. After pouring $225 million into the development and distribution of its detergent products over three years, Clorox was able to achieve only a 3 percent market share. Despite being beaten to market, P&G subsequently introduced Tide with Bleach and was able to achieve a 17 percent share. Reluctantly, Clorox chose to exit the market. Its failure can certainly be attributed in part to the fact that consumers could think of Clorox only in a very limited sense as a bleach product. In a combined “laundry detergent with bleach” product, too, they see laundry detergent as the primary ingredient and bleach as secondary. As a result, in this market we might expect a laundry detergent extension such as Tide with Bleach to have an advantage over a bleach extension such as Clorox. On the other hand, Clorox has successfully extended its brand into household cleaning products like toilet bowl cleaners, where the bleach ingredient is seen as more relevant.⁸⁰

The relationship between primary and secondary ingredients Clorox may have encountered might also explain why Aunt Jemima was successful in introducing a pancake syrup extension from its well-liked pancake mix product, but syrup maker Log Cabin was less successful in introducing a pancake mix extension: pancake mix is seen as a more dominant ingredient than pancake syrup in breakfast pancakes.

6. **Concrete attribute associations tend to be more difficult to extend than abstract benefit associations.** The limits to market leaders’ extension boundaries may be more rigid because many market leaders have strong concrete product attribute associations. These may even be reinforced by their names, like Liquid Paper, Cheez Whiz, and Shredded Wheat.⁸¹ La-Z-Boy, for example, has struggled some to expand its strong usage imagery outside the narrow product line of recliners.

Concrete attribute associations thus may not transfer as broadly to extension categories as more abstract attribute associations.⁸² For example, the Aaker and Keller study showed that consumers dismissed a hypothetical Heineken popcorn extension as potentially tasting bad or like beer, and a hypothetical Crest chewing gum extension as tasting unappealing or like toothpaste.
