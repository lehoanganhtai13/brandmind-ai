its members are more likely to read newspapers where the vast majority of coupons appear. Sales promotions also may just subsidize “coupon enthusiasts” who use coupons frequently and broadly (on as many 188 items a year and up). Eighty-one percent of the products purchased using manufacturer coupons in the first half of 2009 came from just 19 percent of U.S. households. One “extreme” couponer prides herself on the fact that she saves 40–60 percent off her weekly grocery trips and even hosts a blog (www.MoneyWiseMoms.com) to share her couponing tips.³⁸

Another drawback to sales promotions is that new consumers attracted to the brand may attribute their purchase to the promotion and not to the merits of the brand per se and, as a result, may not repeat their purchase when the promotional offer is withdrawn. Finally, retailers have come to expect and now demand trade discounts. The trade may not actually provide the agreed-upon merchandising and take advantage of promotions by engaging in nonproductive activities such as forward buying (stocking up for when the promotion ends) and diversion (shipping products to areas where the promotion was not intended to go).³⁹

Promotions have a number of possible objectives.⁴⁰ With consumers, objectives may target new category users, existing category users, and/or existing brand users. With the trade, objectives may center on distribution, support, inventories, or goodwill. Next, we consider some specific issues related to consumer and trade promotions.

**Consumer Promotions.** Consumer promotions are designed to change the choices, quantity, or timing of consumers’ product purchases. Although they come in all forms, we distinguish between customer franchise building promotions like samples, demonstrations, and educational material, and noncustomer franchise building promotions such as price-off packs, premiums, sweepstakes, and refund offers.⁴¹ Customer franchise building promotions can enhance the attitudes and loyalty of consumers toward a brand—in other words, affect brand equity.

For example, sampling is a means of creating strong, relevant brand associations while also perhaps kick-starting word-of-mouth among consumers. Marketers are increasingly using sampling at the point of use, growing more precise about where and how they deliver samples to maximize brand equity. For a $10 monthly subscription, one new firm, Birchbox, sends consumers a box of deluxe-size samples from such notable beauty brands as Benefit, Kiehl’s, and Marc Jacobs. Members can go to the Web site to collect more information, provide feedback, and earn points for full-sized products. The beauty brands like the selectivity and customer involvement of the promotion.⁴²

Thus, marketers increasingly judge sales promotions by their ability to contribute to brand equity as well as generate sales. Creativity is as critical to promotions as it is to advertising or any other form of marketing communications. The El-Ezaby pharmacy chain in Egypt uses creative promotional appeals and multiple communication channels to engage in constant dialogue with customers in their day-to-day health care issues.
