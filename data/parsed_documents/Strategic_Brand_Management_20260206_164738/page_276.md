## Advantages and Disadvantages

From the perspective of the firm making and supplying the ingredient, the benefit of branding its products as ingredients is that by creating consumer pull, the firm can generate greater sales at a higher margin. There may also be more stable and broader customer demand and better long-term supplier–buyer relationships. Enhanced revenues may accrue from having two revenue streams—the direct revenue from the cost of the supplied ingredients, as well as possible extra revenue from the royalty rights paid to display the ingredient brand.

From the standpoint of the manufacturer of the host product, the benefit is in leveraging the equity from the ingredient brand to enhance its own brand equity. On the demand side, the host product brands may achieve access to new product categories, different market segments, and more distribution channels than they otherwise could have expected. On the supply side, the host product brands may be able to share some production and development costs with the ingredient supplier.

Ingredient branding is not without its risks and costs. The costs of a supporting marketing communication program can be high—advertising to sales ratios for consumer products often surpass 5 percent—and many suppliers are relatively inexperienced at designing mass media communications that may have to contend with inattentive consumers and noncooperative middlemen. As with co-branding, there is a loss of control, because marketing programs for the supplier and manufacturer may have different objectives and thus may send different signals to consumers.

Some manufacturers may be reluctant to become supplier dependent or may not believe that the branded ingredient adds value, resulting in a loss of possible accounts. Manufacturers may resent any consumer confusion about what is the “real brand” if the branded ingredient gains too much equity. Finally, the sustainability of the competitive advantage may be somewhat uncertain, because brands that follow may benefit from consumers’ increased understanding of the role of the ingredient. As a result, follower brands may have to communicate not so much the importance of the ingredient as why their particular ingredient brand is better than the pioneer or other brands.

### Guidelines

Ingredient branding programs build brand equity in many of the same ways that conventional branding programs do. Branding Brief 7-3 describes ingredient branding efforts at DuPont.

Turning to the other side of the equation, what are some specific requirements for successful ingredient branding? In general, ingredient branding must accomplish four tasks:

1. Consumers must first perceive that the ingredient matters to the performance and success of the end product. Ideally, this intrinsic value is visible or easily experienced.  
2. Consumers must then be convinced that not all ingredient brands are the same and that the ingredient is superior. Ideally, the ingredient would have an innovation or some other substantial advantage over existing alternatives.  
3. A distinctive symbol or logo must be designed to clearly signal to consumers that the host product contains the ingredient. Ideally, the symbol or logo would function essentially as a “seal” and would be simple and versatile—it could appear virtually anywhere—and credibly communicate quality and confidence to consumers.  
4. Finally, a coordinated push and pull program must be put into place such that consumers understand the importance and advantages of the branded ingredient. Often this will include consumer advertising and promotions and, sometimes in collaboration with manufacturers, retail merchandising and promotion programs. As part of the push strategy, some communication efforts may also need to be devoted to gaining the cooperation and support of manufacturers or other channel members.

## LICENSING

Licensing creates contractual arrangements whereby firms can use the names, logos, characters, and so forth of other brands to market their own brands for some fixed fee. Essentially, a firm is “renting” another brand to contribute to the brand equity of its own product. Because it can be a shortcut means of building brand equity, licensing has gained in popularity in recent years. The top 125 global licensors drove more than $184 billion in sales of licensed products in 2010. Perhaps the champion of licensing is Walt Disney.
