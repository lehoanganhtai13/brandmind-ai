On June 7, 2007, Coca-Cola acquired Energy Brands, also known as glacéau, maker of enhanced water brands such as vitaminwater, fruitwater, and smartwater, for approximately $4.1 billion. Because these brands were acquired, different accounting rules apply to them. Based upon a preliminary purchase price allocation, approximately $2.8 billion was allocated to trademarks, $2.2 billion to goodwill, $200 million to customer relationships, and $900 million to deferred tax liabilities. At the end of 2007, Coke had trademarks on its balance sheet with a book value of $5.135 billion. Of this figure, about $2.8 billion is associated with Energy Brands.29

Although the Coke brand is estimated to be worth billions, for accounting purposes it is on the books for mere millions.

As the Coca-Cola experiences show, market-based estimates of value can differ dramatically from those based on U.S. accounting conventions.30 Other countries, however, are trying to capture that value. How do we calculate the financial value of a brand? This section, after providing some accounting background and historical perspective, describes several leading brand valuation approaches.31 Brand Focus 10.0 reviews some financial considerations in the relationship of brand equity to the stock market and provides additional perspective on accounting issues in branding.

### Accounting Background.

The assets of a firm can be either tangible or intangible. *Tangible assets* include property, plant, and equipment; current assets (inventories, marketable securities, and cash); and investments in stocks and bonds. We can estimate the value of tangible assets using accounting book values and reported estimates of replacement costs.

*Intangible assets*, on the other hand, are any factors of production or specialized resources that permit the company to earn cash flows in excess of the return on tangible assets. In other words, intangible assets augment the earning power of a firm’s physical assets. They are typically lumped under the heading of *goodwill* and include things such as patents, trademarks, and licensing agreements, as well as “softer” considerations such as the skill of the management and customer relations.

In an acquisition, the goodwill item often includes a premium paid to gain control, which, in certain instances, may even exceed the value of tangible and intangible assets. In Britain and certain other countries, it has been common to write off the goodwill element of an acquisition against reserves; tangible assets, on the other hand, are transferred straight to the acquiring company’s balance sheet.

### Historical Perspectives.

Brand valuation’s more recent past started with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which included a valuation of some of its magazines on its balance sheets in 1984, as permitted by Australian accounting standards. The rationale was that the goodwill element of publishing acquisitions––the difference in value between net By taking advantage of Australian accounting standards to put brand value on balance sheets, Rupert Murdoch was able to build a media giant with News Corporation.
