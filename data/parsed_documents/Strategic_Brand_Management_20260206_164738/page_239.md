With Internet-connected HDTV sales climbing, video opportunities for brand building can only continue to grow.<sup>50</sup> Any size brand can benefit. Tipp-Ex’s “A Hunter Shoots a Bear” campaign became a viral YouTube sensation with millions and millions of views. In the video, a hunter finds a bear approaching his tent but decides not to shoot it. Using Tipp-Ex, he whites out the verb “shoot” and invites viewers to add their own verbs. For each inserted verb, a stored video response is played to humorously depict the action.<sup>51</sup>

As a manifestation of permission marketing, e-mail ads in general—often including advanced features such as personalized audio messages, color photos, and streaming video—have increased in popularity. E-mail ads often receive response rates of 20–30 percent at a cost less than that of banner ads. Tracking these response rates, marketers can fine-tune their messages. The key, as with direct marketing, is to create a good customer list.

Another alternative to banner ads that a great many marketers employ is search advertising, in which users are presented with sponsored links relevant to their search words alongside unsponsored search results. Since these links are tied to specific keywords, marketers can target them more effectively than banner ads and thus generate higher response rates. Almost half of all Internet advertising in 2010 (over $12 billion) was devoted to search.<sup>52</sup>

Google pioneered search advertising and helped make it a cost-effective option for online advertisers by offering “cost-per-click” pricing, wherein advertisers were charged based on the number of times a sponsored link was actually clicked. Companies have developed extensive search advertising strategies, based, for example, on how much to bid for keywords.

### Social Media.

Social media is playing an increasingly important brand communication role due its massive growth. Social media allows consumers to share text, images, audio, and video online with each other and—if they choose—with representatives from companies. Social media comes in many forms, but six key options are:  
1. message boards and forums  
2. chat rooms  
3. blogs  
4. Facebook  
5. Twitter  
6. YouTube

The numbers associated with social media are truly staggering. In November 2010, nearly one in four page views in the United States took place on Facebook. One forecast projected that by 2014, roughly two-thirds of U.S. Internet users will be regular visitors to social media networks.<sup>53</sup>

Social media offers many benefits to marketers. It allows brands to establish a public voice and presence on the Web. It complements and reinforces other communication activities. It helps promote innovation and relevance for the brand. By permitting personal, independent expression, message boards, chat rooms, and blogs can create a sense of community and foster active engagement.

Some social networks, such as Sugar and Gawker, provide an easy means for consumers to learn from and express attitudes and opinions to others. They also permit feedback that can improve all aspects of a brand’s marketing program. Dr. Pepper has an enormous 8.5 million fan base on Facebook. Careful tracking and testing with Facebook users who state that they “like” the brand has allowed the brand to fine-tune its marketing messages. With consumers increasingly avoiding surveys, many marketing researchers are excited about the potential of social networks to yield market insights.<sup>54</sup>

Social media clearly offers enormous opportunities for marketers to connect with consumers in ways that were not possible before. Although some marketers were uncertain as to whether they should engage in social media, many have come to realize that online conversations will occur whether they want them to or not, so the best strategy seems to be to determine how to best participate and be involved. Accordingly, many companies now have official Twitter handles and Facebook pages for their brands.

Different social media can accomplish different objectives. Landor’s Allen Adamson views the chief role of Twitter—with its 140 character text-based limit for posting—as an “early warning system” so marketers know exactly what is happening in the marketplace and how to respond at any one point in time. For example, when a customer tweeted about a bad customer experience with Zappos, because the company was monitoring social media, it was able to immediately send an explanation, apology, and coupon.<sup>55</sup>

Facebook, on the other hand, is more about long-term relationship building and can be used to engage consumers and delve more deeply into their interests and passions. As popular as Facebook is, it is not the only game in town.
