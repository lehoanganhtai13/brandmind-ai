Once marketers have determined the brand planning, they can put into place the actual marketing program to create, strengthen, or maintain brand associations. Chapters 4–7 in Part III of the text describe some of the important marketing issues in designing brand-building marketing programs.

### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Pick a brand. Attempt to identify its sources of brand equity. Assess its level of brand awareness and the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of its associations.  
2. Which brands do you have the most resonance with? Why?  
3. Can every brand achieve resonance with its customers? Why or why not?  
4. Pick a brand. Assess the extent to which the brand is achieving the various benefits of brand equity.  
5. Which companies do you think do a good job managing their customers? Why?

## BRAND FOCUS 3.0

### Creating Customer Value

Many firms are now more carefully defining the financial value of prospective and actual customers and devising marketing programs to optimize that value. Customer–brand relationships are the foundation of brand resonance and building a strong brand. Marketers have long recognized the importance of adopting a strong consumer and customer orientation. The customer-based brand equity concept certainly puts that notion front and center, making it clear that the power of a brand resides in the minds of consumers and customers.

After a remarkable revival in the 1990s when it enjoyed 50 percent growth for seven straight years, Volkswagen AG did not fare well around the turn of the century. By 2005, the company was experiencing stagnant sales and losing money in its critical U.S. market. The culprit? According to VW CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder, “The biggest failure in Volkswagen is too little customer focus.” In his view, the company was paying too much attention to technology and features that he felt customers didn’t necessarily want to pay for. According to Pischetsrieder, “The first question is, how does it help the customer and will the customer pay for it? When we have a test drive, the question is not whether I like it. It’s will the customer pay for it? Or will the customer not even notice it?” As an example of its new reemphasis on the consumer, VW changed the design of the 2011 Jetta it sold in the United States to better reflect U.S. preferences (and bigger bodies). Greater leg and trunk room and larger cup holders were added and costs savings were found to make it more affordable versus its Japanese import competitors.<sup>46</sup>

Volkswagen is not alone in recognizing the financial value of customer experiences. Many firms are now more carefully defining the financial value of prospective and actual customers and devising marketing programs to optimize that value.

### Customer Equity

Many firms have introduced customer relationship marketing programs to improve customer interactions. Some marketing observers encourage firms to formally define and manage the value of their customers. The concept of customer equity can be useful in that regard. Although we can define customer equity in different ways, one definition calls it “the sum of lifetime values of all customers.”<sup>47</sup> Customer lifetime value (CLV) is affected by revenue and by the cost of customer Blattberg and Deighton have defined customer equity as the optimal balance between what marketers spend on customer acquisition and what they spend on customer retention.[^48] They calculated customer equity as follows:
