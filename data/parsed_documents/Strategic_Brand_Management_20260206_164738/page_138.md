This table outlines a framework for analyzing marketing strategies, focusing on two primary equity types: Brand Equity and Customer Equity. Brand Equity is characterized by an emphasis on bottom-line financial value and Customer Relationship Management, though it notes the absence of analysis regarding network effects and competition. Customer Equity, presented as a distinct but related concept, is also emphasized by its bottom-line financial value and Customer Relationship Management. The overall framework highlights prescriptive marketing guidelines and growth opportunities, with a stated missing component of segmentation analysis and quantifiable financial effects. The structure appears comparative, contrasting the components and emphases of Brand Equity and Customer Equity within a broader marketing strategy context.

<p>and the resulting moves and countermoves, nor does it fully account for social network effects, word of mouth, and customer-to-customer recommendations.</p>

<p>Thus, customer equity approaches can overlook the “option value” of brands and their potential impact on revenues and costs beyond the current marketing environment. Brand equity, on the other hand, tends to put more emphasis on strategic issues in managing brands and how marketing programs can be designed to create and leverage brand awareness and image with customers. It provides much practical guidance for specific marketing activities.</p>

<p>With a focus on brands, however, managers do not always develop detailed customer analyses in terms of the brand equity they achieve with specific consumers or groups of consumers and the resulting long-term profitability that is created. Brand equity approaches could benefit from sharper segmentation schemes.</p>

<p><em>Reconciling the Two Points of View.</em> There is no question that customer equity and brand equity are related. In theory, both approaches can be expanded to incorporate the other point of view and they are clearly inextricably linked. Customers drive the success of brands, but brands are the necessary touchpoint that firms have to connect with their customers. Customer-based brand equity maintains that brands create value by eliciting differential customer response to marketing activities. The higher price premiums and increased levels of loyalty engendered by brands generate incremental cash flows.</p>

<p>Many of the actions that will increase brand equity will increase customer equity and vice versa. In practice, customer equity and brand equity are complementary notions in that they tend to emphasize different considerations. Brand equity tends to put more emphasis on the “front end” of marketing programs and intangible value potentially created by marketing programs; customer equity tends to put more emphasis on the “back end” of marketing programs and the realized value of marketing activities in terms of revenue.</p>

<p>The two concepts go hand in hand: customers need and value brands, but a brand ultimately is only as good as the customers it attracts. As evidence of this duality, consider the role of the retailer as “middleman” between firms and consumers. Retailers clearly recognize the importance of both brands and customers. A retailer chooses to sell those brands that are the best “bait” for those customers it wants to attract. Retailers essentially assemble brand portfolios to establish a profitable customer portfolio. Manufacturers make similar decisions, developing brand portfolios and hierarchies to maximize their customer franchises.</p>

<p>But effective brand management is critical, and it is a mistake to ignore its important role in developing long-term profit streams for firms. Some marketing observers have perhaps minimized the challenge and value of strong brands to overly emphasize the customer equity perspective, for example, maintaining that “our attitude should be that brands come and go—but customers . . . must remain.”<sup>51</sup> Yet, that statement can easily be taken to the logical, but opposite, conclusion: “Through the years, customers may come and go, but strong brands will endure.” Perhaps the main point is that both are really crucial, and the two perspectives can help improve the marketing success of a firm. The customer-based brand equity concept is an attempt to do just that.</p> 1.
