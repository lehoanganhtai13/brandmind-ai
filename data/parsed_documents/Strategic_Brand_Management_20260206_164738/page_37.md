This data presents a comparative analysis of ten prominent brands, detailing their Brand Value and Market Capitalization in millions of U.S. dollars, alongside the percentage of Market Cap attributed to each brand. Coca-Cola leads with a Brand Value of $70,452 million and represents 48% of its $146,730 million Market Cap. IBM and Microsoft follow closely in Brand Value, with IBM's Market Cap being $200,290 million (32% of its Market Cap) and Microsoft's being $226,530 million (27% of its Market Cap). Other brands like Google, General Electric, McDonald's, Intel, Nokia, Disney, and Hewlett-Packard are also listed with their respective Brand Values, Market Caps, and the proportion of Market Cap each brand constitutes. Notably, Nokia exhibits the highest percentage of Market Cap at 88%, despite a lower Brand Value compared to many others. The structure is a flat comparison, allowing for direct assessment of brand strength relative to market valuation across diverse industries.

The merger and acquisition frenzy during this time led Wall Street financiers to seek out undervalued companies from which to make investment or takeover profits. One of the primary undervalued assets of such firms was their brands, given that they were off-balance-sheet items. Implicit in Wall Street’s interest was a belief that strong brands result in better earnings and profit performance for firms, which, in turn, creates greater value for shareholders.

The price premium paid for many companies is clearly justified by the opportunity to earn and sustain extra profits from their brands, as well as by the tremendous difficulty and expense of creating similar brands from scratch. For a typical fast-moving consumer goods company, net tangible assets may be as little as 10 percent of the total value (see Figure 1-4). Most of the value lies in intangible assets and goodwill, and as much as 70 percent of intangible assets can be supplied by brands.

## CAN ANYTHING BE BRANDED?

Brands clearly provide important benefits to both consumers and firms. An obvious question, then, is, how are brands created? How do you “brand” a product? Although firms provide the impetus for brand creation through their marketing programs and other activities, ultimately *a brand is something that resides in the minds of consumers.* A brand is a perceptual entity rooted in reality, but it is more than that—it reflects the perceptions and perhaps even the idiosyncrasies of consumers.

To brand a product it is necessary to teach consumers “who” the product is—by giving it a name and using other brand elements to help identify it—as well as what the product does and why consumers should care. In other words, marketers must give consumers a *label* for the product (“here’s how you can identify the product”) and provide *meaning* for the brand (“here’s what this particular product can do for you, and why it’s special and different from other brand name products”).

Branding creates mental structures and helps consumers organize their knowledge about products and services in a way that clarifies their decision making and, in the process, provides value to the firm. *The key to branding is that consumers perceive differences among brands in a product category.* These differences can be related to attributes or benefits of the product or service itself, or they may be related to more intangible image considerations.

Whenever and wherever consumers are deciding between alternatives, brands can play an important decision-making role. *Accordingly, marketers can benefit from branding whenever consumers are in a choice situation.* Given the myriad choices consumers make each and every day—commercial and otherwise—it is no surprise how pervasive branding has become. Consider these two very diverse applications of branding:<sup>18</sup>
