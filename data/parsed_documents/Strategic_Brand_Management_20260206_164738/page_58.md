## THE BRAND EQUITY CONCEPT

In the rest of this book, we’ll present theories, models, and frameworks that accommodate and reflect marketing’s new challenges in order to provide useful managerial guidelines and suggest promising new directions for future thought and research. We’ll introduce a “common denominator” or unified conceptual framework, based on the concept of brand equity, as a tool to interpret the potential effects of various brand strategies.

One of the most popular and potentially important marketing concepts to arise in the 1980s was *brand equity*. Its emergence, however, has meant both good news and bad news to marketers. The good news is that brand equity has elevated the importance of the brand in marketing strategy and provided focus for managerial interest and research activity. The bad news is that, confusingly, the concept has been defined a number of different ways for a number of different purposes. No common viewpoint has emerged about how to conceptualize and measure brand equity.

Fundamentally, branding is all about endowing products and services with the power of brand equity. Despite the many different views, most observers agree that brand equity consists of the marketing effects uniquely attributable to a brand. That is, brand equity explains why different outcomes result from the marketing of a branded product or service than if it were not branded. That is the view we take in this book. As a stark example of the transformational power of branding, consider the auctions sales in Figure 1-11. Without such celebrity associations, it is doubtful that any of these items would cost more than a few hundred dollars at a flea market.

Branding is all about creating differences. Most marketing observers also agree with the following basic principles of branding and brand equity:

* Differences in outcomes arise from the “added value” endowed to a product as a result of past marketing activity for the brand.
* This value can be created for a brand in many different ways.
* Brand equity provides a common denominator for interpreting marketing strategies and assessing the value of a brand.
* There are many different ways in which the value of a brand can be manifested or exploited to benefit the firm (in terms of greater proceeds or lower costs or both).

Fundamentally, the brand equity concept reinforces how important the brand is in marketing strategies. Chapters 2 and 3 in Part II of the book provide an overview of brand equity and a blueprint for the rest of the book. The remainder of the book addresses in much greater depth

This data presents a comparative overview of high-value memorabilia sales, highlighting significant auction prices achieved for items associated with notable figures and cultural artifacts. The structure is a collection of individual sales records, each detailing a specific item, its provenance (owner or origin), and the year and price of its sale. Examples include a Michael Jackson glove ($330,000 in 2010), an Elvis Presley car ($1.2 million in 2011), a Charles Dickens dog collar ($12,000 in 2009), a Supergirl costume ($11,000 in 2010), a Keith Moon T-shirt ($3,550 in 2010), and several items from film and fashion, such as an Audrey Hepburn dress ($56,250), a Marilyn Monroe sweater ($11,875), and Kate Winslet earrings ($25,000), all sold in 2010. The data collectively illustrates the substantial market value attributed to celebrity and cinematic artifacts through auction results.
