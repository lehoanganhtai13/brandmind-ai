A *socially responsible corporate image association* portrays the company as contributing to community programs, supporting artistic and social activities, and generally attempting to improve the welfare of society as a whole. An *environmentally concerned corporate image association* projects a company whose products protect or improve the environment and make more effective use of scarce natural resources. We consider corporate responsibility in more detail below, and Brand Focus 11.0 looks at the broader issue of cause marketing, in which British Airways has been a pioneer.

### BRITISH AIRWAYS

An innovative cause marketer, British Airways has successfully introduced several noteworthy cause programs. It first partnered with UNICEF in 1994 for the cleverly titled Change for Good campaign, based on a very simple idea: foreign coins are particularly difficult to exchange at banks and currency exchanges. So passengers were asked to place any surplus coins—or bills, for that matter—in envelopes provided by British Airways, which donated them directly to UNICEF. British Airways advertised the program on the backs of seat cards, during an in-flight video, and with in-flight announcements with such success that fellow international carriers in the Oneworld Alliance began to participate. In June 2010, the program was replaced with the Flying Start program. This new program was a partnership with Comic Relief UK, a successful charity started by comedians whose aim is to “bring about positive and lasting change in the lives of poor and disadvantaged people.” To publicize the new program, the airlines teamed up with Guinness World Records for the “Highest Stand-Up Comedy Gig in the World.” Three comedians entertained 75 lucky passengers for a two-and-a-half-hour champagne flight. Flying Start was structured like Change for Good—donations were collected in-flight as well as online and at Travelex currency exchange locations in UK airports—but had a stronger local angle. The program raised almost $3 million in its first year, with a goal of raising $20 million by 2013 to “improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children living in the UK and in some of the poorest countries across the world.”[^35]

### Corporate Credibility.

A particularly important set of abstract brand associations is corporate credibility. As defined in Chapter 2, corporate credibility measures the extent to which consumers believe a firm can design and deliver products and services that satisfy their needs and wants. It is the reputation the firm has achieved in the marketplace. Corporate credibility—as well as success and leadership—depend on three factors:

1. *Corporate expertise:* The extent to which consumers see the company as able to competently make and sell its products or conduct its services  
2. *Corporate trustworthiness:* The extent to which consumers believe the company is motivated to be honest, dependable, and sensitive to customer needs  
3. *Corporate likability:* The extent to which consumers see the company as likable, attractive, prestigious, dynamic, and so forth  

While consumers who perceive the brand as credible are more likely to consider and choose it, a strong and credible reputation can offer additional benefits.[^36] Uniqlo is a company with growing international credibility.

### UNIQLO

While many clothing brands have suffered during the economic downturn, Japanese brand Uniqlo is on the rise. At a time when budgets are tight, buying the brand’s colorful T-shirts, sweaters, and jeans—all sold at very competitive prices—is a no-brainer for many consumers. Uniqlo’s clothes are better quality than might be expected for the prices. They feature high-tech materials and aren’t “out of style” in a few months. The brand makes no secret of its heritage, choosing to piggyback on consumer associations of Japan’s exacting quality standards and world-class design innovations. In fact, employees at every store are trained in the same way as those in Japan—even down to the finest details, such as bowing and holding credit cards with two hands when returning them to customers.[^37] UNIQLO
