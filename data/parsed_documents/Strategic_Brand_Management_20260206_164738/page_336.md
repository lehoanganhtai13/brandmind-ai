This table outlines five core brand personality dimensions: Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness. Each dimension is further broken down into specific facets and associated traits. Sincerity encompasses being down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful, with traits like family-oriented and sincere. Excitement is characterized by daring, spirited, imaginative, and up-to-date facets, reflected in traits such as trendy, cool, and independent. Competence is defined by reliability, intelligence, and success, manifesting as hard-working, technical, and leader traits. Sophistication involves being upper-class and charming, with facets like charming and smooth. Finally, Ruggedness is associated with being outdoorsy and tough, evident in traits like masculine and western. This structure presents a hierarchical framework for understanding brand personality, moving from broad dimensions to specific descriptive traits.

and many brand differences are threatened, any insight that helps to support a stronger brand positioning or create a stronger link to consumers is valuable (see Branding Brief 9-4).

We’ve noted that much of this type of research has its roots in ethnographic research originally used by anthropologists. Ethnographic research uses “thick description” based on participant observation. In marketing, the goal of ethnographic research is to extract and interpret the deep cultural meaning of events and activities through various research techniques such as consumer immersion, site visits, shop-alongs, embedded research, etc. [27]

## Making the Most of Consumer Insights

Consumer research plays a significant role in uncovering information valuable to consumer-focused companies. David Taylor, founder of the Brand Gym consultancy, cautions that not all findings from consumer research can be considered insights. He defines an insight as “a penetrating, discerning understanding that unlocks an opportunity.”

According to Taylor, an insight holds far more potential than a finding. Using Microsoft as an example, Taylor draws the contrast between the finding that “people need to process more and more information and data” and the insight that “information is the key to power and freedom.” This insight might help Microsoft develop products that appeal to a larger consumer base than if the company relied solely on the finding.

Taylor developed a set of criteria to evaluate insights:

* **Fresh:** An insight might be obvious and, in fact, be overlooked or forgotten as a result. Check again.
* **Relevant:** An insight when played back to other target consumers should strike a chord.
* **Enduring:** By building on a deep understanding of consumers’ beliefs and needs, a true consumer insight should have potential to remain relevant over time.
* **Inspiring:** All the team should be excited by the insight and see different but consistent applications.

Insights can come from consumer research such as focus groups, but also from using what Taylor describes as the “core insight drills.” A sample of these drills follows:

* How could the brand/category do more to help improve people’s lives?
* What do people really value in the category? What would they not miss?
* What conflicting needs do people have? How can these tradeoffs be solved?
* What bigger market is the brand really competing in from a consumer viewpoint? What could the brand do more of to better meet these “higher-order” needs?
* What assumptions do people make about the market that could be challenged?
* How do people think the product works, and how does it work in reality?
* How is the product used in reality? What other products are used instead of the brand, where the brand could do a better job?

These “drills” can help companies unearth consumer insights that lead to better products and services, and ultimately to stronger brands.
