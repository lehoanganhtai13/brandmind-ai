Equating incidental visual and audio exposures with paid advertising time is, we feel, questionable at best. A commercial is a carefully crafted persuasive declaration of a product’s virtues. It doesn’t compete for attention with the actual on-camera action of a game or race. A 30-second exposure of a billboard in the background can’t match the value of 30 seconds in which the product is the only star.⁶⁶

An alternative measurement approach is the demand-side method, which attempts to identify the effects that sponsorship has on consumers’ brand knowledge structures. Thus, tracking or custom surveys can explore the ability of the event sponsorship to affect awareness, attitudes, or even sales. We can identify and survey event spectators after the event to measure recall of the event’s sponsor, as well as attitudes and intentions toward the sponsor as a result of the event. We can also conduct internal tracking to see how different aspects of the sales process are impacted.

### NATIONWIDE

Nationwide Insurance has a highly successful partnership with NASCAR racing. It sponsors the NASCAR Nationwide Series of stock car races and is also the official auto, home, and life insurance partner of NASCAR. After the third year of a seven-year deal, Nationwide research showed that the insurance company was up 183 percent on lead generation, had raised brand awareness among NASCAR fans by 50 percent, and had increased buying rates for three consecutive years. Nationwide had anticipated NASCAR fans’ legendary loyalty, but its executives were still surprised by the quality and profitability of the relationships they built. As one executive noted: “They’re a higher-value consumer. They tend to buy more than one product and be more responsible, resulting in fewer claims.” Nationwide has also developed business-to-business relationships with other sponsors, racing teams, and tracks. As a result of all these developments, the sponsorship broke even early in the third year of the sponsorship, sooner than expected.⁶⁷

### Mobile Marketing

A fourth broad communication option has emerged in recent years and will undoubtedly play a greater role in brand building in the future. As smartphones are playing an increasingly significant role in consumers’ lives, more marketers are taking notice, and mobile ad spending passed $1 billion in 2011.⁶⁸

Because consumers already use smartphones for information and entertainment as well as communication—and are beginning to use them as shopping devices and payment methods—investment in mobile marketing from a whole range of different sectors looking to tap into a new revenue stream is expected to grow rapidly.
