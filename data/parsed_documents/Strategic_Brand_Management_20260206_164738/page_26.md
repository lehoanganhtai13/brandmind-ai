## HOW CAN YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF THE BOOK?

Branding is a fascinating topic that receives much attention in the popular press. The ideas presented in the book will help you interpret current branding developments. One good way to better understand branding and the customer-based brand equity framework is to apply the concepts and ideas presented in the book to current events, or to any of the more detailed branding issues or case studies presented in the Branding Briefs. The Discussion Questions at the end of the chapters often ask you to pick a brand and apply one or more concepts from that chapter. Focusing on one brand across all the questions—perhaps as part of a class project—permits some cumulative and integrated learning and is an excellent way to become more comfortable with and fluent in the material in the book.

This book truly belongs to you, the reader. Like most marketing, branding doesn’t offer “right” or “wrong” answers, and you should question things you don’t understand or don’t believe. The book is designed to facilitate your understanding of strategic brand management and present some “best practice” guidelines. At the end of the day, however, what you get out of it will be what you put into it, and how you blend the ideas contained in these pages with what you already know or believe.
