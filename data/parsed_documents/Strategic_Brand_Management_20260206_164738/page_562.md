Product design encompasses not only how a product works, but also how it looks, feels, and even sounds and smells. Similarly, service design is a function of all sensory aspects that consumers encounter and experience with a brand. Designing products and services that can more efficiently and effectively deliver the full range of category benefits is still of paramount importance and provides a powerful means to gain competitive advantage. This is true even in many mature categories, as illustrated by Procter & Gamble’s recent success with brands such as Tide, Gillette, and Venus.

Great product and service design comes from keen consumer insight and inspired, creative solutions. A well-designed brand offers advantages in product and service performance, and in the imagery that creates significant functional *and* psychological benefits. Emotional benefits will be most impactful, in particular, when they are directly linked to a functional benefit.

Consider Procter & Gamble’s successful repositioning of its Pampers brand. The disposable diaper had been positioned for years on the basis of dryness and absorbency via classic product comparison advertising. As a result of insights gained from consumer research, the company leveraged those functional product benefits to create a powerful emotional benefit. It based the new Pampers positioning on consumers’ beliefs that: (1) a dry baby sleeps better and (2) a well-rested baby will play and learn more the next day. In other words, to parents, the functional benefit “dryness” leads directly to the emotional benefit of “caring for your baby.” The new positioning thus celebrated Pampers as “caring for baby’s development”—the emotional payoff from the brand’s rational product benefits.

Design considerations will increasingly drive the innovation pipeline. Competitive advantages and brand strength will come from having better-designed products and services than competitors, providing a wider range of compelling consumer benefits as a result.

### 3. Make the Whole of the Marketing Program Greater Than the Sum of the Parts

The diversity of means to communicate about and sell products and services to consumers has grown exponentially in recent years. Major shifts in media viewing habits have emerged due to a number of factors: the fragmentation of TV viewership; the growing use of DVRs, video gaming, and Internet broadband; the increasing use of mobile phones; the explosion of online blogs and social communities; and the greater importance of events, experience, and buzz marketing.
