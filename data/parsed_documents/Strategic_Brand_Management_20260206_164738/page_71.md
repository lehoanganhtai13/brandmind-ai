When consumers report different opinions about branded and unbranded versions of identical products—which almost invariably happens—it must be the case that knowledge about the brand, created by whatever means (past experiences, marketing activity for the brand, or word of mouth), has somehow changed customers’ product perceptions. This result has occurred with virtually every type of product—conclusive evidence that consumers’ perceptions of product performance are highly dependent on their impressions of the brand that goes along with it. In other words, clothes may seem to fit better, a car may seem to drive more smoothly, and the wait in a bank line may seem shorter, depending on the particular brand involved.

### Brand Equity as a Bridge

Thus, according to the customer-based brand equity concept, consumer knowledge drives the differences that manifest themselves in terms of brand equity. This realization has important managerial implications. For one thing, brand equity provides marketers with a vital strategic bridge from their past to their future.

### *Brands as a Reflection of the Past.*

Marketers should consider all the dollars spent on manufacturing and marketing products each year not so much as “expenses” but as “investments” in what consumers saw, heard, learned, felt, and experienced about the brand. If not properly designed and implemented, these expenditures may not be good investments, in that they may not have created the right knowledge structures in consumers’ minds, but we should consider them investments nonetheless. Thus, the *quality* of the investment in brand building is the most critical factor, not the *quantity* beyond some minimal threshold amount. In fact, it is possible to “overspend” on brand building if money is not being spent wisely. Conversely, as we’ll see throughout the book, some brands are considerably outspent but amass a great deal of brand equity through marketing activities that create valuable, enduring memory traces in the minds of consumers, as has been the case with Snickers.

### SNICKERS® Brand

Creatively marketed, Mars Chocolate North America’s best-selling SNICKERS® bar has long been advertised as the candy bar that “satisfies” as a filling snack or means to stave off hunger before a meal. One recent ad campaign centered on a make-believe language, “Snacklish,” that puts a SNICKERS® spin on everyday words and phrases. Taxi, bus-stop, and subway posters and a variety of online postings featured catchy phrases like “Pledge your nutlegience,” “Snaxi” and “Nougetaboutit.” To reinforce its branding, the phrases all appeared in the typeface and colors of the SNICKERS® bar logo.<sup>4</sup> GET A DEGREE IN SNACKONOMICS
