* Households with DVRs are similar to non-DVR households in the basic measures of advertising effectiveness (recall and recognition).
* TV still has very high reach. Declining ratings are due to fragmentation (more channels), not to reduced TV viewing levels that are remarkably resilient to social and technological changes and to the emergence of “new media.” Average ratings halve if the number of channels doubles. In addition, the double jeopardy law applies to TV channels. Bigger channels have more viewers, and these viewers watch the channel for more hours.
* Despite increase in TV channels and fragmentation of audience, TV appears to retain its perceived clout among target audiences in Asia, Europe, and North America and holds across recent years. While the influence of digital media has grown, it has not caused a corresponding decrease in TV perceived clout.

### Creative Quality
* Advertising that communicates a unique selling proposition (USP) outperforms advertising, which does not. Ideally, the USP should be based on an important benefit; alternatively and riskier, it could be based on a feature that clearly implies a benefit. It is effective if it is unique in the minds of consumers even though other brands could make the same claim. However, it is especially effective if it cannot be easily matched by competitors.
* The number of times a brand visually appears in a TV commercial increases the degree of correct brand association with that commercial.
* Emotional response to a TV advertisement influences both branded engagement (directly) and persuasion (indirectly), and therefore the likelihood of short-term sales. This pattern holds for TV advertisements across Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, but the magnitude of effect is different.
