Slogans often become closely tied to advertising campaigns and serve as tag lines to summarize the descriptive or persuasive information conveyed in the ads. DeBeers’s “A Diamond Is Forever” tag line communicates that diamonds bring eternal love and romance and never lose value. Slogans can be more expansive and more enduring than just ad tag lines, though campaign-specific tag lines may help reinforce the message of a particular campaign instead of the brand slogan for a certain period of time.

For example, through the years, Nike has used tag lines specific to ad campaigns for events or sports such as “Prepare for Battle” and “Quick Can’t Be Caught” (basketball); “Write the Future,” (World Cup); “My Better Is Better” (multisport); and “Here I Am” (women) instead of the well-known brand slogan, “Just Do It.” Such substitutions can emphasize that the ad campaign represents a departure of some kind from the message conveyed by the brand slogan, or just a means to give the brand slogan a rest so that it remains fresh.

### Designing Slogans.  
Some of the most powerful slogans contribute to brand equity in multiple ways.<sup>54</sup> They can play off the brand name to build both awareness *and* image, such as “Be Certain with Certs” for Certs breath mints; “Maybe She’s Born with It, Maybe It’s Maybelline” for Maybelline cosmetics; or “The Big Q Stands for Quality” for Quaker State motor oil.

Slogans also can contain product-related messages and other meanings. Consider the historical Champion sportswear slogan, “It Takes a Little More to Make a Champion.” The slogan could be interpreted in terms of product performance, meaning that Champion sportswear is made with a little extra care or with extra-special materials, but it could mean that Champion sportswear is associated with top athletes. This combination of superior product performance and aspirational user imagery is a powerful platform on which to build brand image and equity.

Benetton has had an equally strong slogan on which to build brand equity (“United Colors of Benetton”), but as Branding Brief 4-2 describes, the company has not always taken full advantage of it.

### Updating Slogans.  
Some slogans become so strongly linked to the brand that it becomes difficult to introduce new ones (take the famous slogan quiz in Figure 4-7 and check the accompanying footnote to see how many slogans you can correctly identify). Marketers of 7UP tried a number of different successors to the popular “Uncola” slogan—including “Freedom of Choice,” “Crisp and Clean and No Caffeine,” “Don’t You Feel Good About 7UP,” and “Feels So Good Coming Down,” and for over five years the somewhat edgy “Make 7UP Yours.” A new ad in 2011 featuring hip-hop singer–songwriter Cee Lo Green beatboxing used yet another tag line, “Be Yourself. Be Refreshing. Be 7UP.” One of the world’s top clothing manufacturers (with global sales of $2.4 billion), Benetton has experienced some ups and downs in managing its brand equity.
