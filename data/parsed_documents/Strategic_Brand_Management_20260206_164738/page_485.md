## Fortifying versus Leveraging

Chapters 4–7 described a number of different ways to raise brand awareness and create strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in consumer memory to build customer-based brand equity. In managing brand equity, marketers face tradeoffs between activities that fortify brand equity and those that leverage or capitalize on existing brand equity to reap some financial benefit.

Marketers can design marketing programs that mainly try to capitalize on or maximize brand awareness and image—for example, by reducing advertising expenses, seeking increasingly higher price premiums, or introducing numerous brand extensions. The more marketers pursue this strategy, however, the easier it is to neglect and perhaps diminish the brand and its sources of equity. Without its sources of brand equity, the brand itself may not continue to yield such valuable benefits. Just as failure to properly maintain a car eventually affects its performance, so too can neglecting a brand, for whatever reason, catch up with marketers.

### WONDER BREAD

Wonder Bread was introduced as America’s first sliced bread in the 1930s and, in its familiar blue, red, and yellow packaging, was a staple in many homes for decades since. After a series of ownership changes increased the company’s focus on cost-cutting, however, Wonder Bread ceased advertising in the 1970s. Later, as consumer tastes shifted toward multigrain breads, Wonder Bread’s corporate owners balked at the expense and time required to produce it. Although a new owner resurrected the brand’s advertising campaign in 1996, the brand had effectively lost “two generations [of customers]” and struggled to recover, eventually filing for bankruptcy in 2004. The owners, Interstate Bakeries, took five years to fully emerge from the bankruptcy. Having done so, they initiated a series of actions and investments to help restore Wonder Bread to its previous stature. They reformulated the Wonder Classic and Wonder Classic Sandwich bread varieties to include more calcium and vitamin D. They also introduced Wonder Smartwhite—a new bread with the taste and soft texture of white bread, but with the fiber of 100 percent whole wheat. The company launched its first national advertising campaign for Wonder Bread in years, sending the message,  
“One thing you don’t have to wonder about? The goodness of new Wonder.”[^6]

### Fine-Tuning the Supporting Marketing Program

Marketers are more likely to change the specific tactics and supporting marketing program for the brand than its basic positioning and strategic direction. They should make such changes, however, only when it’s clear the marketing program and tactics are no longer making the desired contributions to maintaining or strengthening brand equity.
