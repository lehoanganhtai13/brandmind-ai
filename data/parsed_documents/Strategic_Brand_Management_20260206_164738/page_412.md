For example, companies may be associated with products or services that solve particular problems (Black & Decker), bring excitement and fun to certain activities (Nintendo), are built with the highest quality standards (Motorola), contain advanced or innovative features (Rubbermaid), or represent market leadership (Hertz).

Two specific product-related corporate image associations—high quality and innovation—deserve special attention.

A **high-quality corporate image association** creates consumer perceptions that a company makes products of the highest quality. A number of different organizations like J.D. Power, *Consumer Reports*, and various trade publications for automobiles rate products. The Malcolm Baldrige award is one of many that distinguishes companies on the basis of quality. Quality is one of the most important, if not *the* most important, decision factors for consumers.

An **innovative corporate image association** creates consumer perceptions of a company as developing new and unique marketing programs, especially with respect to product introductions or improvements. Keller and Aaker experimentally showed how different corporate image strategies—being innovative, environmentally concerned, or involved in the community—could affect corporate credibility and strategically benefit the firm by increasing the acceptance of brand extensions.<sup>33</sup> Interestingly, consumers saw a company with an innovative corporate image as not only expert but also trustworthy and likable. Being innovative is seen in part as being modern and up-to-date, investing in research and development, employing the most advanced manufacturing capabilities, and introducing the newest product features.

An image priority for many Japanese companies—from consumer product companies such as Kao to more technically oriented companies such as Canon—is to be perceived as innovative.<sup>34</sup> Perceived innovativeness is also a key competitive weapon and priority for firms in other countries. Michelin (“A Better Way Forward”) describes how its commitment to the environment, security, value, and driving pleasure has been spurring innovation. Branding Brief 11-4 describes how 3M has developed an innovative culture and image.

### People and Relationships.

Corporate image associations may reflect characteristics of the employees of the company. Although focusing on employees is a natural positioning strategy for service firms like Southwest Airlines, Avis car rental, and Ritz-Carlton hotels as well as retailers like Walmart, manufacturing firms like DuPont and others have also used it in the past. Their rationale is that the traits that employees exhibit will directly or indirectly influence consumers about the products the firm makes or the services it provides.

Consumers may themselves form more abstract impressions of a firm’s employees, especially in a services setting. One major public utility company was described by customers as “male, 35–40 years old, middle class, married with children, wearing a flannel shirt and khaki pants, who would be reliable, competent, professional, intelligent, honest, ethical, and business-oriented.” On the downside, these same customers also described the utility as “distant, impersonal, and self-focused,” suggesting an important area for improvement in its corporate brand image.

Retail stores also derive brand equity from their employees. For example, from its origins as a small shoe store, Seattle-based Nordstrom has become one of the nation’s leading fashion specialty retailers through a commitment to quality, value, selection, and, especially, service. Legendary for its “personalized touch” and willingness to go to extraordinary lengths to satisfy its customers, Nordstrom creates brand equity largely through the efforts of its salespeople and the relationships they develop with customers.

Thus, a *customer-focused corporate image association* creates consumer perceptions of a company as responsive to and caring about its customers. Consumers believe their voice will be 3M has fostered a culture of innovation and improvisation from its very beginnings.
