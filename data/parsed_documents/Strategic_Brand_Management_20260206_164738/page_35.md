# WHY DO BRANDS MATTER?

An obvious question is, why are brands important? What functions do they perform that make them so valuable to marketers? We can take a couple of perspectives to uncover the value of brands to both customers and firms themselves. Figure 1-3 provides an overview of the different roles that brands play for these two parties. We’ll talk about consumers first.

## Consumers

As with the term *product*, this book uses the term **consumer** broadly to encompass all types of customers, including individuals as well as organizations. To consumers, brands provide important functions. Brands identify the source or maker of a product and allow consumers to assign responsibility to a particular manufacturer or distributor. Most important, brands take on special meaning to consumers. Because of past experiences with the product and its marketing program over the years, consumers find out which brands satisfy their needs and which ones do not. As a result, brands provide a shorthand device or means of simplification for their product decisions.⁷

If consumers recognize a brand and have some knowledge about it, then they do not have to engage in a lot of additional thought or processing of information to make a product decision. Thus, from an economic perspective, brands allow consumers to lower the search costs for products both internally (in terms of how much they have to think) and externally (in terms of how much they have to look around). Based on what they already know about the brand—its quality, product characteristics, and so forth—consumers can make assumptions and form reasonable expectations about what they may *not* know about the brand.

The meaning imbued in brands can be quite profound, allowing us to think of the relationship between a brand and the consumer as a type of bond or pact. Consumers offer their trust and loyalty with the implicit understanding that the brand will behave in certain ways and provide them utility through consistent product performance and appropriate pricing, promotion, and distribution programs and actions. To the extent that consumers realize advantages and benefits from purchasing the brand, and as long as they derive satisfaction from product consumption, they are likely to continue to buy it.

These benefits may not be purely functional in nature. Brands can serve as symbolic devices, allowing consumers to project their self-image. Certain brands are associated with certain types of people and thus reflect different values or traits. Consuming such products is a means by which consumers can communicate to others—or even to themselves—the type of person they are or would like to be.⁸

Some branding experts believe that for some people, certain brands even play a religious role of sorts and substitute for religious practices and help reinforce self-worth.⁹ The cultural influence of brands is profound and much interest has been generated in recent years in understanding the interplay between consumer culture and brands.¹⁰

This table outlines the distinct roles and functions of branding from the perspectives of both consumers and manufacturers. For consumers, branding serves as a tool for identifying product origins, assigning responsibility to the maker, and reducing perceived risk and search costs. It acts as a promise or pact with the manufacturer and functions as a symbolic device, ultimately signaling product quality. From the manufacturer's viewpoint, branding is a means of identification for handling and tracing, and a method for legally protecting unique features. It signals quality levels to customers, endows products with unique associations, provides a source of competitive advantage, and ultimately generates financial returns. The structure is comparative, highlighting the dual nature of branding as a strategic tool for businesses and a functional aid for consumers.
