Its “Straight from the Bog” ad campaign showed two folksy farmers waist-deep in a cranberry bog humorously extolling the virtues of various Ocean Spray products. The campaign was reinforced by a host of events, promotions, and other PR activities.¹⁹

Cranberry THE WONDERBERRY Hi, we're Ocean Spray cranberry growers. Growing cranberries is hard work, but it's worth it. Cranberries are good for you because they're packed with powerful nutrients that help cleanse and purify your body and help strengthen your immune system. And cranberries make our products taste real good, too. So keep enjoying Ocean Spray products. We'll grow more.

### Revitalize the Brand.  
Sometimes brand extensions can be a means to renew interest in and liking for the brand. A classic example is with the General Motors luxury brand nameplate Cadillac, whose sales were fading fast by the end of the 1990s. At that time, many marketing experts put the brand on life support and predicted its demise. The introduction of the sleek CTS sedan in 1999—backed by a powerful Led Zeppelin soundtrack in the launch ads—signaled that things were changing for the brand. The follow-up introduction of the flashy, muscular Escalade SUV, however, completely transformed the brand’s image. Seen as urban and edgy, the Escalade further modernized the aging brand, making it more contemporary and relevant.²⁰

### Permit Subsequent Extensions.  
One benefit of a successful extension—especially a category extension—is that it may serve as the basis for subsequent extensions. Consider how Billabong transcended its surfer origins to introduce products that tapped into related lifestyle activities.

## BILLABONG  
The Billabong brand was established in 1973 by Gordon Merchant, who wanted to create a brand that had “functional products for surfers to help us better enjoy our sport.” During the 1970s and 1980s, Billabong established its brand credibility with the young surfing community as a designer and producer of quality surf apparel. In the early 1980s, it began to sell its products in Japan, Europe, and the United States through licensees. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the brand extended into other youth-oriented areas, such as snowboarding and skateboarding, but sticking to its core brand proposition: contemporary, relevant, innovative products of consistent high quality. In 2004, the company launched an entirely new brand called Honolua Surf Co., inspired by Hawaiian surf styles. Later years saw various brand acquisitions too: Nixon Inc., a premium watch and accessories maker in the surf, skate, and snowboard markets; Von Zipper edgy eyewear and goggles, Element shoes, Kustom footwear, and Mrs. Palmers surf wax and accessories. As a result of its consistent growth, Billabong was ranked the eighth most valuable brand in Australia, with an estimated value of $1.1 billion.²¹ Billabong’s strong lifestyle appeal has allowed the brand to enter several new categories beyond surfing such as snowboarding and skateboarding.
