Brand images can be extremely sticky, and once strong associations have formed, they may be difficult to change. Consumers may choose to ignore or simply be unable to remember the new positioning when strong, but different, brand associations already exist in memory.¹¹ Club Med has attempted for years to transcend its image as a vacation romp for swingers to attract a broader cross-section of people.

For dramatic repositioning strategies to work, marketers must present convincing new brand claims in a compelling fashion. One classic example of a brand that successfully shifted from a primarily non-product-related image to a primarily product-related image is BMW, the quintessential “yuppie” vehicle of the 1980s. The brand’s sales dropped almost in half from 1986 to 1991 as new Japanese competition emerged and a backlash to the “Greed Decade” set in. Convinced that high status was no longer a sufficiently desirable and sustainable position, marketing switched the focus to BMW’s product developments and improvements, such as its responsive driving and leading-edge engineering. The brand was also able to add a strong safety message—but in a very BMW kind of way. Volvo’s emphasis on safety, for instance, was about how the design and construction of the car would protect occupants if the car was hit. BMW’s safety message was that the car handled so well, you just wouldn’t get hit! These performance-focused efforts, showcased in creative ads, helped diminish the “yuppie” association, and by 1995 sales had approached their earlier peak.¹²

**Summary.** Reinforcing brand equity requires consistency in the amount and nature of the supporting marketing program for the brand. Although the specific tactics may change, marketers should preserve and amplify the key sources of equity for the brand where appropriate. Product innovation and relevance are paramount in maintaining continuity and expanding the meaning of the brand.

At the end of every day, week, month, quarter, and year, marketers should ask themselves, What we have done to innovate our brand and its marketing and make them more relevant? A weak answer can have adverse consequences. One-time industry icons Nokia and Blackberry have both desperately struggled in recent years to catch up as the smartphone market has gone through remarkable technological and marketing transformations.¹³ On a more positive note, Branding Brief 13-2 describes how the British brand Burberry remade itself in the world of fashion. Next, we consider what to do when brands find themselves in situations in which more drastic brand actions are needed.

# REVITALIZING BRANDS

In virtually every product category are examples of once prominent and admired brands that have fallen on hard times or even completely disappeared. Nevertheless, a number of brands have managed to make impressive comebacks in recent years, as marketers have breathed new life into their customer franchises.¹⁴ Boston Market, Altoids, Bally, and Ovaltine are among them. Consider Lacoste’s comeback story.

## LACOSTE

Lacoste, founded in France in 1933, became a style icon for its tennis-themed sportswear and is credited with selling the first polo shirt, the famed “alligator shirt” featuring an animal—actually, a crocodile—as the logo. During the 1980s, when it was owned by cereal maker General Mills, Lacoste failed to keep up with fashion trends and saw sales drop. In response, the company cut prices and sold to discounters like Walmart and Kmart, which further damaged the brand’s image. Lacoste continued to suffer from slow sales until 2002, when Robert Siegel, a former Levi’s executive credited with helping to create Dockers, was brought in to oversee the relaunch of the brand in the United States. Under Siegel, Lacoste stopped selling to non-luxury retailers, prohibiting sales to places like T.J. Maxx and a number of Macy’s department stores. The company regenerated its fading fashion lines by introducing tighter-fitting shirts for women and opening own-brand boutiques in fashionable shopping areas to showcase its new look. Having established a strong foundation, its marketers now needed to sell a broader portfolio than just the polo shirt with which the brand is often strongly associated and which provides 30–40 percent of U.S. sales. To broaden its sales footprint in the marketplace, Lacoste introduced a new sub-brand, Lacoste Live, targeting a younger, more contemporary customer.
