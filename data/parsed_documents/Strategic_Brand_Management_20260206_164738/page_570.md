Figure 15-11 outlines additional guidelines for industrial products, presenting a comprehensive list of promotional tools. These guidelines encompass a range of media advertising options, including television, radio, newspapers, and magazines, alongside more specialized channels like trade journal advertising and directories. The list also includes direct mail, brochures, and sales literature, emphasizing tangible communication materials. Further promotional strategies involve audiovisual presentation tapes, giveaways, and event-focused marketing such as sponsorship, exhibitions, trade shows, and conventions. Finally, the guidelines incorporate publicity and public relations as key components of an industrial product's promotional strategy. The structure is a straightforward enumeration of distinct promotional methods.

## Industrial and Business-to-Business Products

Industrial goods and business-to-business marketing sometimes call for different branding practices. Here are some basic branding guidelines (see Figure 15-11).

**Adopt a corporate or family branding strategy and create a well-defined brand hierarchy.** Because companies selling industrial goods often carry a large and complex number of product lines and variations, marketers should devise a logical and well-organized brand hierarchy. Given the breadth and complexity of their product mix, companies selling industrial goods—like GE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, ABB, BASF, and John Deere—are more likely to emphasize corporate or family brands. Thus, a particularly effective branding strategy for industrial goods is to create sub-brands by combining a well-known and respected corporate name with descriptive product modifiers.

**Link non-product-related imagery associations.** Programs to build brand equity for industrial goods can be different from those for consumer goods because, given the nature of the organizational buying process, product-related associations may play a relatively more important role than non-product-related associations. Industrial brands often emphasize functionality and cost–benefit comparisons. Nevertheless, even non-performance-related associations can be useful for forming other perceptions of the firm, such as prestige or the type of companies that use its products.

Corporate or family brands must convey credibility and possess favorable overall associations. Corporate credibility is often a primary risk reduction heuristic adopted by industrial buyers. For years, one of the key sources of brand equity for IBM was the perception that “you’ll never get fired for buying IBM.” Once that special cachet faded, the brand found itself in a much more competitive situation. Creating a feeling of security for industrial buyers can thus be an important source of brand equity. Many industrial firms distinguish themselves on the basis of the customer service they provide, in addition to the quality of their products.

**Employ a full range of marketing communication options.** Another difference between industrial and consumer products is the way they are sold (see Figure 15-12). Industrial marketing communications tend to convey more detailed product information in a more direct or face-to-face manner. Thus, personal selling plays an important role. At the same time, other communication options can enhance awareness or the formation of brand associations. One effective industrial marketing communication approach is to combine direct hard-sell messages with indirect image-related messages that convey who and what the company is all about.

**Leverage equity of other companies that are customers.** Industrial brands can leverage secondary associations differently; for example, identifying other companies that are customers for their products or services conveys credibility. The challenge in advertising that fact, however, is ensuring these other companies don’t distract from the message about the advertised company and its brands.

Figure 15-12 illustrates alternative communication options within the Business-to-Business (B2B) market, focusing on the strategic use of customer relationships in advertising. The core idea is that highlighting existing customer relationships, such as identifying companies that purchase a firm's products or services, can effectively convey credibility. However, a significant challenge arises in managing this advertising approach: ensuring that the mention of these other companies does not detract from the primary message about the advertised company and its own brands. This suggests a delicate balance between leveraging customer endorsements and maintaining brand focus in B2B marketing communications.

**Segment customers carefully and develop tailored branding and marketing programs.** Finally, as for any brand, understand how different customer segments view products and brands. For industrial goods, different customer segments such as engineers, accountants, and purchasing managers may exist within as well as across organizations and have different associations that serve as sources of brand equity. It may be particularly important to achieve points-of-parity with these different constituencies, so that key points-of-difference can come into play.

Marketing programs must reflect the role of individuals in the buying center, or the process-initiator, influencer, purchaser, user, and so on. Some individuals within the organization may be more concerned with developing a deep relationship with the company and therefore place greater value on trustworthiness and corporate credibility; others may seek merely to make transactions and therefore place greater value on product performance and expertise.

## High-Tech Products

One special category of physical goods, in both consumer and industrial markets, is technologically intensive or high-tech products. The distinguishing feature of high-tech products is that they change rapidly over time because of innovations and R&D breakthroughs. Technology isn’t limited to computer-related products: it has played an important role in the branding and marketing of products as diverse as razor blades for Gillette and athletic shoes for Nike.
