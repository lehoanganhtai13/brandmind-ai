> Just over a year ago, we began a global conversation about how the planet is becoming smarter. By smarter, we mean that intelligence is being infused into the systems and processes that make the world work—into things no one would recognize as computers: cars, appliances, roadways, power grids, clothes, even natural systems such as agriculture and waterways.
>
> Trillions of digital devices, connected through the Internet, are producing a vast ocean of data. And all this information—from the flow of markets to the pulse of societies—can be turned into knowledge because we now have the computational power and advanced analytics to make sense of it. With this knowledge we can reduce costs, cut waste, and improve the efficiency, productivity and quality of everything from companies to cities.
>
> A year into this new era, the signs of a smarter planet are all around us. Smarter systems are being implemented and are creating value in every major industry, across every region in both the developed and developing worlds. This idea isn't a metaphor, or a vision, or a proposal—it's a rapidly emerging reality.

## LVMH

LVMH is a French-based company that is ranked as the world’s largest luxury group. Its brands include Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo, Givenchy, Pucci, and Sephora. LVMH has frequently struggled with projecting its exclusive brand image, whilst simultaneously driving sales growth through more store outlets and consumers. Louis Vuitton is the company’s most profitable brand, accounting for 45 percent of group profit; furthermore analysts predict its sales could double in seven years fuelled by growth in Asia.

In 2011, LVMH made a strategic $24 million investment to secure a 20 percent stake in Singaporean Charles & Keith, an affordable high-fashion shoe retailer. Started in 1996 by two brothers, Charles & Keith now has over 200 outlets across Asia and the Middle East and intends to quickly increase sales from 300 to 500 percent by expanding into the United States, China, India, and Europe.

The LVMH investment is expected to fund Charles & Keith’s planned expansion into China and improve its shoe quality for the highly demanding Middle East market. Charles & Keith will continue to operate under its own name and management team. Meanwhile, LVMH gains exposure to Charles & Keith’s explosive top-line growth, gets insights into running an Asian low-cost operation, and maintains its own brand exclusivity by running the businesses independently.<sup>4</sup>
