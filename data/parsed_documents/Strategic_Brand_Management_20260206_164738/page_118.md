Creating strong, favorable, and unique associations is a real challenge to marketers, but essential to building customer-based brand equity. Strong brands typically have firmly established favorable and unique brand associations with consumers. Brand meaning is what helps produce *brand responses,* or what customers think or feel about the brand. We can distinguish brand responses as either brand judgments or brand feelings, that is, in terms of whether they arise from the “head” or from the “heart,” as the following sections describe.

## Brand Judgments

*Brand judgments* are customers’ personal opinions about and evaluations of the brand, which consumers form by putting together all the different brand performance and imagery associations. Customers may make all types of judgments with respect to a brand, but four types are particularly important: judgments about quality, credibility, consideration, and superiority.

### Brand Quality.

Brand attitudes are consumers’ overall evaluations of a brand and often form the basis for brand choice.<sup>20</sup> Brand attitudes generally depend on specific attributes and benefits of the brand. For example, consider Hilton hotels. A consumer’s attitude toward Hilton depends on how much he or she believes the brand is characterized by certain associations that matter to the consumer for a hotel chain, like location; room comfort, design, and appearance; service quality of staff; recreational facilities; food service; security; prices; and so on.

Consumers can hold a host of attitudes toward a brand, but the most important relate to its perceived quality and to customer value and satisfaction. Perceived quality measures are inherent in many approaches to brand equity. In the annual EquiTrend study by Harris Interactive, 20,000 consumers aged 15 or older rate a random selection of 60 brands from a total of 1,200 brands across 46 categories on several dimensions: Equity, Consumer Connection, Commitment, Brand Behavior, Brand Advocacy, and Trust. An Equity score is determined by a calculation of measures of Familiarity, Quality, and Purchase Consideration.<sup>21</sup>

### Brand Credibility.

Customers may also form judgments about the company or organization behind the brand. *Brand credibility* describes the extent to which customers see the brand as credible in terms of three dimensions: perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and likability. Is the brand seen as (1) competent, innovative, and a market leader (*brand expertise*); (2) dependable and keeping customer interests in mind (*brand trustworthiness*); and (3) fun, interesting, and worth spending time with (*brand likability*)? In other words, credibility measures whether consumers see the company or organization behind the brand as good at what it does, concerned about its customers, and just plain likable.<sup>22</sup>

### FEDEX

From its earliest advertising, “When It Absolutely, Positively Has to Be There Overnight,” FedEx has stressed its speed, skill, and dependability in shipping and delivery. Its most recent brand campaign, “We Understand,” reinforces that FedEx is “the perfect enabler and facilitator of great service and partnership.” Internationally, its “FedEx Delivers to a Changing World” ad campaign reinforces that “one of the constants in the world is FedEx.” The company wants customers to think of it as a trusted partner, with a commitment to reliable but cost-effective shipping all over the world. Its advertising, however, often uses humor and high production values. FedEx ads that run during the Super Bowl are often rated among the most enjoyable by consumers. Through its flawless service delivery and creative marketing communications, FedEx is able to establish all three dimensions of credibility: expertise, trustworthiness, and likability.<sup>23</sup> A FedEx delivery truck with large FedEx logo on the side, parked in a busy urban area with many billboards and advertisements in the background.
