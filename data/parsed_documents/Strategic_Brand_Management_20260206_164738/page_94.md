A brand audit can help marketers assess the severity of the competitive threat and the appropriate competitive stance, as described in Chapter 8.

## Developing a Good Positioning

A few final comments are useful to help guide positioning efforts. First, a good positioning has a “foot in the present” and a “foot in the future.” It needs to be somewhat aspirational so that the brand has room to grow and improve. Positioning on the basis of the current state of the market is not forward-looking enough; but, at the same time, the positioning cannot be so removed from the current reality that it is essentially unobtainable. The real trick in positioning is to strike just the right balance between what the brand is and what it could be.

Second, a good positioning is careful to identify all relevant points-of-parity. Too often marketers overlook or ignore crucial areas where the brand is potentially disadvantaged to concentrate on areas of strength. Both are obviously necessary as points-of-difference will not matter without the requisite points-of-parity. One good way to uncover key competitive points-of-parity is to role play competitor’s positioning and infer their intended points-of-difference. Competitor’s PODs will, in turn, become the brand’s POPs. Consumer research into the trade-offs in decision-making that exist in the minds of consumers can also be informative.

Third, a good positioning should reflect a consumer point of view in terms of the benefits that consumers derive from the brand. It is not enough to advertise that you are the “biggest selling gasoline in the world”—as Shell Oil did once. An effective POD should make clear *why* that it so desirable to consumers. In other words, what benefits would a consumer get from that unique attribute? Does that mean Shell Oil is more convenient due to more locations, or perhaps able to charge lower prices due to economies of scale? Those benefits, if evident, should become the basis for the positioning, with the proof point or RTB being the attribute of “biggest selling gasoline.”

Finally, as we will develop in greater detail with the brand resonance model in the next chapter, it is important that a duality exists in the positioning of a brand such that there are rational and emotional components. In other words, a good positioning contains points-of-difference and points-of-parity that appeal both to the “head” and the “heart.”

## DEFINING A BRAND MANTRA

Brand positioning describes how a brand can effectively compete against a specified set of competitors in a particular market. In many cases, however, brands span multiple product categories and therefore may have multiple distinct—yet related—positionings. As brands evolve and expand across categories, marketers will want to craft a brand mantra that reflects the essential “heart and soul” of the brand.

### Brand Mantras

To better establish what a brand represents, marketers will often define a brand mantra.[57] A *brand mantra* is a short, three- to five-word phrase that captures the irrefutable essence or spirit of the brand positioning. It’s similar to “brand essence” or “core brand promise,” and its purpose is to ensure that all employees and external marketing partners understand what the brand most fundamentally is to represent to consumers so they can adjust their actions accordingly. For example, McDonald’s brand philosophy of “Food, Folks, and Fun” nicely captures its brand essence and core brand promise.

Brand mantras are powerful devices. They can provide guidance about what products to introduce under the brand, what ad campaigns to run, and where and how the brand should be sold. They may even guide the most seemingly unrelated or mundane decisions, such as the look of a reception area and the way employees answer the phone. In effect, brand mantras create a mental filter to screen out brand-inappropriate marketing activities or actions of any type that may have a negative bearing on customers’ impressions of a brand.

Brand mantras help the brand present a consistent image. Any time a consumer or customer encounters a brand—in any way, shape, or form—his or her knowledge about that brand may change and affect the equity of the brand. Given that a vast number of employees come into contact with consumers, either directly or indirectly, their words and actions should consistently reinforce and support the brand meaning. Marketing partners like ad agency members may not even recognize their role in influencing equity. The brand mantra signals its meaning and importance to the firm, as well as the crucial role of employees and marketing partners in its management.
