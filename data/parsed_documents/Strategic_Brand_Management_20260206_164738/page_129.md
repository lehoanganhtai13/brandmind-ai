Some brands have more resonance potential than others. When it is difficult to create a varied set of feelings and imagery associations, marketers might not be able to obtain the deeper aspects of brand resonance like active engagement. Nevertheless, by taking a broader view of brand loyalty, they may be able to gain a more holistic appreciation for their brand and how it connects to consumers. And by defining the proper role for the brand, they should be able to obtain higher levels of brand resonance.

# THE BRAND VALUE CHAIN

Developing a strong positioning and building brand resonance are crucial marketing goals. To better understand the ROI of marketing investments, however, another tool is necessary. The *brand value chain* is a structured approach to assessing the sources and outcomes of brand equity and the manner by which marketing activities create brand value. It recognizes that many different people within an organization can affect brand equity and need to be aware of relevant branding effects. The brand value chain thus provides insights to support brand managers, chief marketing officers, managing directors, and chief executive officers, all of whom may need different types of information.

The brand value chain has several basic premises. Consistent with the brand resonance model, it assumes that the value of a brand ultimately resides with customers. Based on this insight, the model next assumes that the brand value creation process begins when the firm invests in a marketing program targeting actual or potential customers (stage 1). The associated marketing activity then affects the customer mind-set—what customers know and feel about the brand—as reflected by the brand resonance model (stage 2). This mind-set, across a broad group of customers, produces the brand’s performance in the marketplace—how much and when customers purchase, the price that they pay, and so forth (stage 3). Finally, the investment community considers this market performance—and other factors such as replacement cost and purchase price in acquisitions—to arrive at an assessment of shareholder value in general and a value of the brand in particular (stage 4).

The model also assumes that a number of linking factors intervene between these stages. These linking factors determine the extent to which value created at one stage transfers or “multiplies” to the next stage. Three sets of multipliers moderate the transfer between the marketing program and the three value stages: the program quality multiplier, the marketplace conditions multiplier, and the investor sentiment multiplier. The brand value chain model is summarized in Figure 3-5. Next we describe the value stages and multiplying factors in more detail and look at examples of both positive and negative multiplier effects.

This table outlines a framework for understanding value creation, structured across four key stages: Marketing Program Investment, Customer Mind-Set, Market Performance, and Shareholder Value. The Marketing Program Investment stage encompasses various components such as Product, Communications, Trade, Employee, and Other investments. These investments influence the Customer Mind-Set, which is characterized by Awareness, Associations, Attitudes, Attachment, and Activity. The resulting Market Performance is measured by metrics including Price premiums, Price elasticities, Market share, Expansion success, Cost structure, and Profitability. Ultimately, these factors contribute to Shareholder Value, reflected in Stock price, P/E ratio, and Market capitalization. Interacting with these stages are "Multipliers": Program Quality Multiplier (Distinctiveness, Relevance, Integrated, Value, Excellence), Marketplace Conditions Multiplier (Competitive reactions, Channel support, Customer size and profile), and Investor Sentiment Multiplier (Market dynamics, Growth potential, Risk profile, Brand contribution), which modulate the effectiveness of the investments and the translation of performance into value. Brand value creation begins with marketing activity by the firm.
