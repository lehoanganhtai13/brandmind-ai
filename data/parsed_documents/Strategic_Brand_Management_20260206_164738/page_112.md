The “Brand Newcastle” project developed a new strategy reflecting the reality of the modern Newcastle, overcoming outdated perceptions.

Research revealed that Newcastle was a diverse, cosmopolitan, and relaxed city, home to numerous world class organizations, all of which frequently surprised people who had never been to the city. These attributes were woven into a new brand “NEWCASTLE,” with multiple colors embedded in the lettering. The phrase “See Change” was used to directly ask people to rethink their perceptions of the city and leveraged leading local organizations. The new branding identified Newcastle as a vibrant and multi-faceted world class city, encouraging people to reconsider their perceptions.<sup>4</sup>

In other words, it may be harder to try to *change* existing brand attitudes than to *remind* people of their existing attitudes toward a brand in additional, but appropriate, consumption situations.

**Summary.** A highly salient brand is one that has both depth and breadth of brand awareness, such that customers always make sufficient purchases as well as always think of the brand across a variety of settings in which it could possibly be employed or consumed. Brand salience is an important first step in building brand equity, but is usually not sufficient. For many customers in many situations, other considerations, such as the meaning or image of the brand, also come into play.

Creating brand meaning includes establishing a brand image—what the brand is characterized by and should stand for in the minds of customers. Brand meaning is made up of two major categories of brand associations related to performance and imagery. These associations can be formed directly, from a customer’s own experiences and contact with the brand, or indirectly, through advertising or by some other source of information, such as word of mouth.

The next section describes the two main types of brand meaning—brand performance and brand imagery—and the subcategories within each of those two building blocks.

### Brand Performance

The product itself is at the heart of brand equity, because it is the primary influence on what consumers experience with a brand, what they hear about a brand from others, and what the firm can tell customers about the brand in their communications. Designing and delivering a product that fully satisfies consumer needs and wants is a prerequisite for successful marketing, regardless of whether the product is a tangible good, service, organization, or person.
