2. What changes should we make to the positioning? Do we need to create any new associations? Should we *not* recreate any existing associations? Should we modify any existing associations?  
3. How should we create this new mental map? Can we still use the same marketing activities? What changes should we make? What new marketing activities are necessary?

Because the brand is often at an earlier stage of development when going abroad, we often must first establish awareness and key points-of-parity. Then we can consider additional competitive considerations. In effect, we need to define a hierarchy of brand associations in the global context that defines which associations we want consumers in all countries to hold, and which we want consumers only in certain countries to have. We have to determine how to create these associations in different markets to account for different consumer perceptions, tastes, and environments. Thus, we must be attuned to similarities and differences across markets.

As this discussion suggests, although firms are increasingly adopting an international marketing perspective to capitalize on market opportunities, a number of possible pitfalls exist. Before providing some specific tactical guidelines as to how to build global customer-based brand equity, we first turn to two fundamentally important contrasts in global branding: standardization versus customization, and developing versus developed markets.

# STANDARDIZATION VERSUS CUSTOMIZATION

The most fundamental issue in developing a global marketing program is the extent to which the marketing program should be standardized across countries, because this decision has such a deep impact on marketing structure and processes. Perhaps the biggest proponent of standardization was the legendary Harvard professor Ted Levitt.

In a controversial 1983 article, Levitt argued that companies needed to learn to operate as if the world were one large market, ignoring superficial regional and national differences.<sup>31</sup> According to Levitt, because the world was shrinking—due to leaps in technology, communication, and so forth—well-managed companies should shift their emphasis from customizing items to offering globally standardized products that are advanced, functional, reliable, and low-priced for all. Levitt’s strong position elicited an equally strong response. One ad executive commented, “There are about two products that lend themselves to global marketing—and one of them is Coca-Cola.” Other critics pointed out that even Coca-Cola did not standardize its marketing—as Branding Brief 14-2 illustrates—and noted the lack of standardization in other leading global brands, such as McDonald’s and Marlboro.

The experiences of these top marketers have been shared by others who found out—in many cases, the hard way—that differences in consumer behavior still prevail across countries. Many firms have been forced to tailor products and marketing programs to different national markets as a result. In short, it’s difficult to identify any one company applying the global marketing concept in the strict sense—by selling the same brand exactly the same way everywhere.

## Standardization *and* Customization

Increasingly, marketers are blending global objectives with local or regional concerns. From these perspectives, transferring products across borders may mean consistent positioning for the brand, but not necessarily the same brand name and marketing program in each market. Similarly, packaging may have the same overall look but be tailored as required to fit the local populace and market needs. For example, Danone’s kids’ yogurts are sold under a variety of names—Danonino, Danoontje, Danimals—in over 120 countries, while a general manager leads a central team that coordinates and oversees the local marketing efforts.<sup>32</sup>

In short, centralized marketing strategies that preserve local customs and traditions can be a boon for products sold in more than one country—even in diverse cultures. Fortunately, firms have improved their capabilities to tailor products and programs to local conditions. Flexible manufacturing technology has decreased the concentration of activities, and advances in information systems and telecommunications have allowed increased coordination.

Domino’s Pizza tried to maintain the same delivery system everywhere but had to adapt the model to local customs in launching its brand overseas. In Britain, customers thought anybody The most recognized brand name in the world got its start in an Atlanta pharmacy, where it sold for five cents a glass.
