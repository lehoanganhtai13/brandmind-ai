# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 1-1

## Understanding Business-to-Business Branding

Six specific guidelines—developed in greater detail in later chapters—can be defined for marketers of B2B brands.

1. **Ensure the entire organization understands and supports branding and brand management.**  
Employees at all levels and in all departments must have a complete, up-to-date understanding of the vision for the brand and their role in supporting it. A particularly crucial area is the sales force; personal selling is often the profit driver of a business-to-business organization. The sales force must be properly aligned so that the department can more effectively leverage and reinforce the brand promise. If branding is done right, the sales force can ensure that target customers recognize the brand’s benefits sufficiently to pay a price commensurate with the brand’s potential value.

2. **Adopt a corporate branding strategy if possible and create a well-defined brand hierarchy.**  
Because of the breadth and complexity of the product or service mix, companies selling business-to-business are more likely to emphasize corporate brands (such as Hewlett-Packard, ABB, or BASF). Ideally, they will also create straightforward sub-brands that combine the corporate brand name with descriptive product modifiers, such as with EMC or GE. If a company has a distinctive line of business, however, a more clearly differentiated sub-brand may need to be developed, like Praxair’s Medipure brand of medical oxygen, DuPont’s Teflon coating, and Intel’s Centrino mobile technology.

3. **Frame value perceptions.**  
Given the highly competitive nature of business-to-business markets, marketers must ensure that customers fully appreciate how their offerings are different. *Framing* occurs when customers are given a perspective or point of view that allows the brand to “put its best foot forward.” Framing can be as simple as making sure customers realize all the benefits or cost savings offered by the brand, or becoming more active in shaping how customers view the economics of purchasing, owning, using and disposing of the brand in a different way. Framing requires understanding how customers currently think of brands and choose among products and services, and then determining how they *should* ideally think and choose.

4. **Link relevant non-product-related brand associations.**  
In a business-to-business setting, a brand may be differentiated on the basis of factors beyond product performance, such as having superior customer service or well-respected customers or clients. Other relevant brand imagery might relate to the size or type of firm. For example, Microsoft and Oracle might be seen as “aggressive” companies, whereas 3M and Apple might be seen as “innovative.” Imagery may also be a function of the other organizations to which the firm sells. For example, customers may believe that a company with many customers is established and a market leader.

5. **Find relevant emotional associations for the brand.**  
B2B marketers too often overlook the power of emotions in their branding. Emotional associations related to a sense of security, social or peer approval, and self-respect can also be linked to the brand and serve as key sources of brand equity. That is, reducing risk to improve customers’ sense of security can be a powerful driver of many decisions and thus an important source of brand equity; being seen as someone who works with other top firms may inspire peer approval and personal recognition within the organization; and, beyond respect and admiration from others, a business decision-maker may just feel more satisfied by working with top organizations and brands.

6. **Segment customers carefully both within and across companies.**  
Finally, in a business-to-business setting, different customer segments may exist both within and across organizations. Within organizations, different people may assume the various roles in the purchase decision process: Initiator, user, influencer, decider, approver, buyer and gatekeeper. Across organizations, businesses can vary according to industry and company size, technologies used and other capabilities, purchasing policies, and even risk and loyalty profiles. Brand building must take these different segmentation perspectives in mind in building tailored marketing programs.
