## Applications

There is a long academic and industry tradition of exploring price premiums using marketing-based comparative approaches. In the mid-1950s, Edgar Pessemier developed a dollar-metric measure of brand commitment that relied on a step-by-step increase of the price difference between the brand normally purchased and an alternative brand.⁷ To reveal brand-switching and loyalty patterns, Pessemier plotted the percentage of consumers who switched from their regular brand as a function of the brand price increases.

A number of marketing research suppliers have adopted variations of this approach to derive similar types of demand curves, and many firms now try to assess price sensitivity and willingness-to-pay thresholds for different brands.⁸ For example, Intel would routinely survey computer shoppers to find out how much of a discount they would require before switching to a personal computer that did not have an Intel microprocessor in it (say, an AMD chip) or, conversely, what premium they would be willing to pay to buy a personal computer that did have an Intel microprocessor in it.

We can apply marketing-based comparative approaches in other ways, assessing consumer response to different advertising strategies, executions, or media plans through multiple test markets. For example, SymphonyIRI’s electronic test markets and similar research methodologies can permit tests of different advertising weights or repetition schedules as well as ad copy tests. By controlling for other factors, we can isolate the effects of the brand and product. Recall from Chapter 2 how Anheuser-Busch conducted an extensive series of test markets that revealed that Budweiser beer had such a strong image with consumers that advertising could be cut, at least in the short run, without hurting sales performance.

Marketers can also explore potential brand extensions by collecting consumer evaluations of a range of concept statements describing brand extension candidates. For example, Figure 10-1 displays the results of a consumer survey conducted at one time to examine reactions to hypothetical extensions of the Planters nuts brand. Contrasting those extensions provides some indication of the equity of the brand.

In this example, the survey results suggested that consumers expected any Planters brand extension to be “nut-related.” Appropriate product characteristics for a possible Planters brand extension seemed to be “crunchy,” “sweet,” “salty,” “spicy,” and “buttery.” In terms of where in the store consumers would have expected to find new Planters products, the snack and candy sections seemed most likely. On the other hand, consumers did not seem to expect to find new Planters products in the breakfast food aisle, bakery product section, refrigerated section, or frozen food section.

This data presents a hierarchical scale rating from 1 to 10, correlating average scale ratings with proposed extensions for food products. Higher ratings, such as 10, are associated with simple, direct applications like "Peanuts," while progressively lower ratings encompass more complex or varied product categories. For instance, a rating of 9 includes "Snack mixes, nuts for baking," and a rating of 7 covers "Pretzels, chocolate nut candy, caramel corn." As the scale decreases, the proposed extensions broaden to include items like "Snack crackers, potato chips, nutritional granola bars" at a rating of 6, and "Tortilla chips, toppings (ice cream/dessert)" at a rating of 5. Further down the scale, ratings of 4 and 3 involve "Lunchables/lunch snack packs, dessert mixes" and "Ice cream/ice cream bars, toppings (salad/vegetable)," respectively. The lowest ratings, 2 and 1, are linked to a wide array of products including "Cereal, toaster pastries, Asian entrees/sauces, stuffing mix, refrigerated dough, jams/jellies" and "Yogurt," indicating a spectrum from primary ingredients to more processed or composite food items.

Reactions to Proposed Planters Extensions

<sup>a</sup>Consumers rated hypothetical proposed extensions on an 11-point scale anchored by 0 (definitely would *not* expect Planter’s to sell it) and 10 (definitely would expect Planter’s to sell it).
