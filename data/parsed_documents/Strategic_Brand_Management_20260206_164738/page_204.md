This table outlines the key functions involved in the marketing of goods and services, illustrating a process-oriented structure. It begins with **Marketing research**, which focuses on gathering customer information. This is followed by **Communications** to develop and execute product/service messaging. **Contact** involves actively seeking and interacting with potential customers. The **Matching** function then adapts the offering to meet customer needs. **Negotiations** are crucial for finalizing terms of trade, including price. **Physical distribution** handles the logistics of transporting and storing goods. **Financing** facilitates transactions by providing credit or funds. **Risk-taking** encompasses assuming the inherent risks in moving products to market. Finally, **Service** addresses the ongoing customer relationship, encompassing maintenance and repair.

This figure illustrates the various services that channel members provide, categorized into three main groups: those that facilitate the exchange process, those that facilitate the physical distribution process, and those that facilitate facilitating functions. Exchange process services include information gathering and dissemination, promotion, negotiation, and ordering. Physical distribution services encompass matching buyers and sellers, physical handling, and storage. Facilitating functions include financing and risk-taking. These services collectively contribute to the efficient functioning of the marketing channel by bridging the gap between producers and consumers.

> **Channel Support.** A number of different services provided by channel members can enhance the value to consumers of purchasing and consuming a brand name product (see Figure 5-5). Although firms are increasingly providing some of the services themselves through toll-free numbers and Web sites, establishing a “marketing partnership” with retailers may nevertheless be critical to ensuring proper channel support and the execution of these various services.

> Manufacturers can take a number of steps to keep retail partners happy and prevent breaks in the supply chain. Resellers often sink significant amounts of money into maintaining their facilities and paying sales staffs. To compensate them, manufacturers can offer dealers exclusive access to new products, or branded variants, as described below. Experts also advise that manufacturers stick to fixed prices when they offer products directly to consumers. If they do offer big discounts, they should offer them at outlet malls, where they won’t confuse customers.  
>  
> Manufacturers also can back up their distributors by educating them about their products so the retail partners can shape an effective sales force. When makeup giant Mary Kay began selling its cosmetics online in 1997, it also helped the members of its direct sales force set up their own online stores. Sharing product information and also doing good advertising contributes to distributors’ success. John Deere effectively partnered with its channel members on customer service.

### JOHN DEERE

John Deere was founded in 1837 by a blacksmith who devised a new type of cast-steel plow that revolutionized Midwest farming. The firm is now best known, however, for its tractors and residential and commercial-use products, such as mowers, ATVs, and saws. Over the decades, Deere dealers sprouted throughout the country, growing to more than 10,000 in the 1920s. Consolidation led to a contraction of the dealer network, a trend that Deere has actively encouraged in recent years as it tries to ensure that dealers have the necessary technological and business expertise to deal with increasingly large and sophisticated farm conglomerates. In 2003, John Deere expanded beyond its mainly rural network of more than 2,500 dealers to gain access to an additional 100,000 customers by selling its products through Home Depot. In doing so, Deere avoided conflict by assigning dealers to handle the service for purchases made from the mass channel, ensuring that they gained immediate revenue and an opportunity for future sales.<sup>76</sup>

Ultimately, companies have to share the power to make decisions with their distributors and recognize that dealers’ success benefits them too. In many markets, dealers have captured more of the retail sales, so manufacturers must keep them happy and profitable if they want the benefits of a smooth supply chain.
