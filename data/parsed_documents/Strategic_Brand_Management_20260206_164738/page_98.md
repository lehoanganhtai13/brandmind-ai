# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 2-2

## Branding Inside the Organization

Brand mantras point out the importance of **internal branding**—making sure that members of the organization are properly aligned with the brand and what it represents. Much of the branding literature has taken an *external* perspective, focusing on strategies and tactics that firms should take to build or manage brand equity with customers. Without question, at the heart of all marketing activity is the positioning of a brand and the essence of its meaning with consumers.

Equally important, however, is positioning the brand **internally.**[^59] For service companies especially, it’s critical that all employees have an up-to-date and deep understanding of the brand. Recently, a number of companies have put forth initiatives to improve their internal branding.

One of the fastest growing and most successful restaurant chains in the United States, Panda Express, devotes significant resources to internal training and development for employees. Besides services training, privately owned Panda Express supports the personal improvement efforts of its staff—controlling weight, working on communications skills, jogging, and attending seminars—in the belief that healthier, happier employees increase sales and profitability.

Singapore Airlines also invests heavily in employee training: new recruits receive four months of training, twice as long as the industry average. The company also spends about $70 million a year on retraining each of its 14,500 existing employees. Training focuses on deportment, etiquette, wine appreciation, and cultural sensitivity. Cabin crew learn how to interact differently with Japanese, Chinese, and U.S. passengers as well as the importance of communicating at eye level and not “looking down” at passengers.

Companies need to engage in continual open dialogue with their employees. Branding should be perceived as participatory. Some firms have pushed B2E (business-to-employee) programs through corporate intranets and other means. Disney is seen as so successful at internal branding that its Disney Institute holds seminars on the “Disney Style” of creativity, service, and loyalty for employees from other companies.

In short, for both motivating employees and attracting external customers, internal branding is a critical management priority.

## REVIEW

Customer-based brand equity is the differential effect that brand knowledge has on consumer response to the marketing of that brand. A brand has positive customer-based brand equity when customers react more favorably to a product and the way it is marketed when the brand is identified than when it is not.

We can define brand knowledge in terms of an associative network memory model, as a network of nodes and links wherein the brand node in memory has a variety of associations linked to it. We can characterize brand knowledge in terms of two components: brand awareness and brand image. Brand awareness is related to the strength of the brand node or trace in memory, as reflected by consumers’ ability to recall or recognize the brand under different conditions. It has both depth and breadth. The depth of brand awareness measures the likelihood that consumers can recognize or recall the brand. The breadth of brand awareness measures the variety of purchase and consumption situations in which the brand comes to mind. Brand image is consumer perceptions of a brand as reflected by the brand associations held in consumers’ memory.

Customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer has a high level of awareness and familiarity with the brand and holds some strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in memory. In some cases, brand awareness alone is sufficient to result in more favorable consumer response—for example, in low-involvement decision settings where consumers are willing to base their choices merely on familiar brands. In other cases, the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of the brand associations play a critical role in determining the differential response making up the brand equity.
