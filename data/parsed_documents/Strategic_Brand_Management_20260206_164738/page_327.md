# BRANDING BRIEF 9-1

## Digging Beneath the Surface to Understand Consumer Behavior

For example, Hoover became suspicious when people claimed in surveys that they vacuumed their houses for an hour each week. To check, the company installed timers in certain models and exchanged them for the same models in consumers’ homes. The timers showed that people actually spent only a little over **half** an hour vacuuming each week. One researcher analyzed household trash to determine the types and quantities of food people consumed, finding that people really don’t have a very good idea of how much and what types of food they eat. Similarly, much research has shown that people report they eat healthier food than would appear to be case if you opened their cabinets!

DuPont commissioned marketing studies to uncover personal pillow behavior for its Dacron polyester unit, which supplies filling to pillow makers and sells its own Comforel brand (now part of INVISTA). One challenge: people don’t give up their old pillows. Thirty-seven percent of one sample described their relationship with their pillow as like “an old married couple,” and an additional 13 percent characterized their pillow like a “childhood friend.” The researchers found that people fell into distinct groups in terms of pillow behavior: stackers (23 percent), plumpers (20 percent), rollers or folders (16 percent), cuddlers (16 percent), and smashers, who pound their pillows into a more comfy shape (10 percent). Women were more likely to plump, while men were more likely to fold. The prevalence of stackers led the company to sell more pillows packaged as pairs, as well as to market different levels of softness or firmness.

Much of this type of research has its roots in *ethnography*, the anthropological term for the study of cultures in their natural surroundings. The intent behind these in-depth, observational studies is for consumers to drop their guard and provide a more realistic portrayal of who they are rather than who they would like to be. On the basis of ethnographic research that uncovered consumers’ true feelings, ad campaigns have been created for a Swiss chocolate maker with the theme “The True Confessions of a Chocoholic” (because chocolate lovers often hid stashes all though the house), for Tampax tampons with the theme “More Women Trust Their Bodies to Tampax” (because teen users wanted the freedom to wear body-conscious clothes), and for Crisco shortening with the theme “Recipe for Success” (because people often baked pies and cookies in a celebratory fashion).

Qualitative research has a long history in marketing. Ernest Dichter, one of the early pioneers in consumer psychoanalytic research, first applied these research principles in a study for Plymouth automobiles in the 1930s. His research revealed the important—but previously overlooked—role that women played in the automobile purchase decision. Based on his consumer analysis, Plymouth adopted a new print ad strategy that highlighted a young couple gazing admiringly at a Plymouth automobile under the headline “Imagine Us in a Car Like That.” Dichter’s subsequent work had an important impact on a number of different ad campaigns.

Some of his assertions were fairly controversial. For instance, he equated convertibles with youth, freedom, and the secret wish for mistresses; argued that women used Ivory soap to wash away their sins before a date; and maintained that baking was an expression of femininity and pulling a cake or loaf out of an oven for women was “in a sense like giving birth.” His suggested tagline “Putting a Tiger in the Tank” for Exxon resulting in a long-running and successful ad campaign, however.

This section next reviews a number of qualitative research techniques for identifying sources of brand equity such as brand awareness, brand attitudes, and brand attachment. These techniques also can identify outcomes of brand equity such as price elasticities and brand choice and preference.

### Free Association

The simplest and often the most powerful way to profile brand associations is free association tasks, in which subjects are asked what comes to mind when they think of the brand, without any more specific probe or cue than perhaps the associated product category. (“What does the Rolex name mean to you?” or “Tell me what comes to mind when you think of Rolex watches.””) Auto
