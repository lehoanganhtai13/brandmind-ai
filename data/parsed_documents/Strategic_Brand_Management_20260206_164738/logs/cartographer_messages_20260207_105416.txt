Analyze the document structure in this folder and create a global_map.json file.

Follow your cognitive workflow:
1. RECONNAISSANCE: Find the Table of Contents
2. TARGET ACQUISITION: For each section, verify location and pinpoint exact line numbers
3. CONTEXTUALIZATION: Create rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities
4. ARTIFACT GENERATION: Write the complete JSON to /global_map.json

Remember: Use write_file tool to save the final JSON. Do not output JSON in chat.

💭 Thinking:
  **My Approach to Document Analysis**

Okay, so I'm being tasked with a structured document analysis, aiming to produce a `global_map.json` file. The user's expectation is clear: I need to methodically dissect the document's structure, which aligns perfectly with my preferred approach. I'll execute this using a defined cognitive workflow: Reconnaissance, Target Acquisition, Contextualization, and finally, Artifact Generation.

First things first, I need a lay of the land. Before diving into the document, I need to understand the current environment. A quick check of the files in the directory is essential. This preliminary reconnaissance will give me context, letting me grasp how the document I need to analyze interacts with its surroundings. The goal is to avoid any unexpected dependencies or edge cases. With this initial scan, I can begin to assess the scope of the task and start formulating a plan of attack.

💭 Thinking:
  Okay, here's the summary of my thought process, keeping in mind I'm an expert and this is how I'd approach this:

**Initial Assessment: Navigating a Large File Set**

Alright, a set of files numbered `page_1.md` all the way to `page_591.md`. That's a decent chunk of documentation. My first instinct, as always with large sets like this, is to find a Table of Contents. It's almost a given that something this size will have one, and it's likely located at the beginning for ease of access. I'll need to confirm that.

Therefore, I'll quickly scan the initial few files – the first handful, maybe the first ten or so, focusing on `page_1.md` through `page_10.md`. This initial sweep should reveal the presence (or absence) of a ToC and give me a good lay of the land, so I don't go poking around blindly. It's the most efficient way to get an overview before diving into the details.

  Here's my thought process, as if I were reading this text:

**Initial Assessment: Navigating the Landscape**

Okay, first things first. Before diving deep, I need a roadmap. I'm going to scan the first five pages. This initial pass is all about finding the Table of Contents. If it's well-structured, that ToC will be invaluable in quickly grasping the scope, the organizational logic, and the key arguments this author is presenting. It’s the skeleton key to unlocking the whole structure. I need to understand the architecture of this argument. This is efficient; no need to waste time skimming aimlessly. I'm looking for the layout of the land.

  Here's the summary, assuming I'm an expert and this is a search for a table of contents:

**Locating the Elusive Table of Contents**

Alright, still no joy. This is a bit frustrating. I know these things *have* to be in here somewhere. Let's try a targeted approach. My experience tells me that it’s frequently situated near the beginning, usually within the first few pages. I’ll make a sweep through pages six to fifteen. I have a hunch that it's in that zone, so I'll methodically check for either a dedicated "Table of Contents" section or a clearly defined list that outlines the structure of the document. Time to delve into those pages and get this resolved quickly.

  Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Initial Assessment of Table of Contents Structure**

Right, so I've quickly zeroed in on the table of contents. Page 8, the "Brief Contents" – always a useful high-level overview to get my bearings. Then, diving deeper, page 10 starts the more detailed "Contents" proper.

My instinct now is to continue scanning through the ToC, page by page. I'm looking for the hierarchical organization, the main sections and their subsections, the flow of argument. Page 16 is likely to give me a more complete picture, or at least fill in some gaps in my understanding of the structure. I expect this will help me determine if the document meets my expectations in terms of depth, breadth, and logical arrangement.

💭 Thinking:
  Here's a breakdown of my current understanding of the document's structure.

**Initial Structural Overview and Potential Page Offset**

Okay, I've got a solid grasp of the organization. Let's see... we're looking at a book that seems to follow a pretty standard format for this kind of material, as it's broken down into logical parts and chapters, which is a good starting point. I can see the typical front matter: a Prologue, Preface, Acknowledgments, and About the Author. Then, the real meat of it, Part I begins with an introductory chapter on Brands and Brand Management, laying the foundation.

Following the introduction, Part II delves into the strategic aspects, starting with customer-based brand equity and positioning and then moving on to brand resonance and the value chain. This is the stage where the authors are talking about building a brand strategy, and at this point, it's all about laying the groundwork for the more practical elements to follow.

Part III is all about the execution, the practical application. Chapter 4 delves into choosing brand elements. Then, we get into actual marketing programs and their integration, as well as leveraging secondary brand associations. Now, we're talking about really developing the brand.

Part IV is focused on measuring the performance; equity measurement, capturing the customer mind-set, and overall market performance. This is the assessment stage.

The book moves on to the long-term, Part V deals with growth and sustainability: developing branding architecture, new product introductions, and brand extensions. There are also chapters on managing brands over time and across geographies. These chapters offer insight into the ongoing effort to cultivate a brand.

Finally, Part VI is closing up, with Closing Observations and a concluding Epilogue. Then the Index. That's a comprehensive overview.

The Table of Contents gives page numbers relative to a printed book, but the files are named sequentially, so I need to account for an offset. I must check a few examples – specifically, Chapter 1 which references page 29. I need to verify that `page_29.md` is actually the correct file to look at. A little adjustment might be necessary to correlate those. It's a small detail, but critical for proper indexing and linking.

  Okay, here's my take on those thoughts, tailored for an expert audience:

**Navigating the Metadata Maze**

Hmm, this is a classic metadata discrepancy. Page 29 is supposed to be the "About the Author" section, but the table of contents (ToC) explicitly lists it as page 28. This kind of inconsistency is a red flag. It could indicate a simple typo, a late edit that wasn't properly reflected in the ToC, or, worse, a deeper issue with the document's structure and indexing.

My immediate response, given this situation, is to pull up the source file for page 28. Let me check `page_28.md` and see what's actually in that file. That should clear up the most immediate issue and give me some context about how the error came to be. From there, I can determine the appropriate solution: a quick fix of the ToC or a deeper structural adjustment of the document and its indexing.

  **Navigating the Digital Table of Contents**

Okay, so I'm trying to reconcile the printed page numbers with the actual filenames here. It seems pretty straightforward at first – page `28` on the printed ToC should correspond to `page_28.md`, right? The initial assumption is that there's a direct alignment with maybe a consistent offset to account for introductory material or something.

But hold on... I'm a little thrown off now. The ToC claims "About the Author" is on page 28, which should be `page_28.md`, but I just checked that file and it's *not* the author bio. Hmm, interesting. I found "About the Author" in `page_29.md` instead! 

Alright, let's back up. Maybe there's a hidden printed page number somewhere in `page_29.md` that wasn't immediately apparent. I'll check the very bottom and scan the text for a printed page number, or any reference to a page number in the content. Nothing. Okay, let's keep going, what's in `page_30.md`?

💭 Thinking:
  **Navigating the Page Numbering Discrepancy**

Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The table of contents (ToC) indicates Chapter 1 begins on printed page 29. I saw that `page_30.md` contains content about "Brands and Brand Management," which seems like the right topic. I quickly rechecked `page_29.md` and it's the "About the Author" section, which the ToC *also* puts on page 28, and a check of the ToC on printed page 10 confirms this layout.

So, I'm trying to map printed page numbers to the actual `.md` filenames. Based on this, it looks like there's a +1 offset: `page_28.md` is actually "About the Author," corresponding to printed page 28. But the content in `page_30.md` matches the ToC description of what should be on printed page 29, "Brands and Brand Management".

To be certain, I need to check the page numbers within the files themselves. And yes, in `page_30.md`'s metadata, it clearly says `Page Number: 30/591`. That confirms my hypothesis of a +1 offset between the ToC's printed page number and the `.md` filename.

Now, I'll test it out with "Preview 30" mentioned in Chapter 1. If my +1 offset is correct, then "Preview" should be found in `page_31.md`. Let's confirm that.

  **Verifying the Page Offset Calculation**

Alright, let's nail this down. I've got this "Preview" section listed on `page_31.md`, but the Table of Contents (ToC) indicates "Preview 30". Hmm, looks like there's an offset of +1. It's a simple, elegant idea: `page_id` is essentially the ToC page number plus one.

Okay, let's apply that rule and rigorously test it. The ToC indicates "Preface 21". If my offset theory holds, that should correspond to `page_22.md`.  And let’s check “PART I Opening Perspectives 29” – based on my hypothesis, that should be on `page_30.md`.

Wait... I *think* I already saw that `page_30.md` included "Brands and Brand Management" and "Learning Objectives". Let's double-check the ToC entry: "PART I Opening Perspectives 29" and right below, "Chapter 1 Brands and Brand Management 29". Ah-ha! It’s all making sense. `page_30.md` must contain the start of Chapter 1. Then, `page_29.md` contained "About the Author", which the ToC lists as "About the Author 28". Yep, offset +1 works.

Okay, final test. Let's look at the "Index" at the end. The ToC lists "Index 577". Using the established offset, that should translate to `page_578.md`. I should check that. Let's go see.

  Okay, here's my quick mental rundown:

**Verifying the Page Numbering Logic**

Right, so the index entry, "Index", is definitely on `page_578.md`. The Table of Contents (ToC) entry, however, stated "Index 577". This discrepancy strongly suggests the simple offset I suspected is accurate: `page_id = ToC_page + 1`.

Now, before I commit to that as a universal rule, let's just quickly check another entry. Let's verify the "Preface" reference, "Preface 21". If this is consistent, I'd expect that to correspond with `page_22.md`, as that is the next page.

💭 Thinking:
  **Systematic Verification of Chapter and Part Start Pages**

Okay, so I'm starting by establishing the mapping between the Table of Contents (ToC) page numbers and the corresponding markdown files. It looks like the rule of thumb is `page_id = ToC_page + 1`. With that understanding, I'll methodically work through the document structure, chapter by chapter, part by part, and I'll confirm their start pages. I'm going to pay close attention to the "PART" headers, since those often precede the chapters and their relationships need to be precise.

Based on the initial parsing, I've got a preliminary hypothesis of the structure, but now I'll go through and verify the files at these key pages: `page_30.md`, `page_68.md`, `page_142.md`, `page_292.md`, `page_386.md`, and `page_548.md`.

Wait, I think I already started looking at `page_30.md`. And after a closer look, it doesn't seem to contain the expected "PART I" in the initial lines. I'll need to double-check this, or perhaps look back at `page_29.md`. After consulting the "Brief Contents" section on page 8, and the contents description on page 10, it looks like they are not perfectly aligned. It looks like the Part header is on one page, and the Chapter is on the next page. I should check `page_30.md` more carefully, especially from line 1.

**Checking for Missing Sections**

Alright, still no sign of that initial "PART I" I'm expecting. Hmm, I wonder if it's slipped into another file by mistake. Let me double-check that `page_29.md` file. I seem to recall reviewing that one already – wasn't that the "About the Author" section? Ah, yes, I remember now, it included the usual biographical details, nothing relevant to the actual analysis I'm doing here. But, just to be thorough, I should scan the very *end* of `page_29.md` again. Often, these files have notes or lingering fragments at the bottom that might shed some light on the organizational structure. You never know. It's a bit tedious, but it's important to be methodical when you're looking for something specific. Let's see...

  **Initial Assessment & Troubleshooting**

Okay, so I've been given a text or a sequence of pages, and the immediate thought is... nothing. There's literally nothing here to summarize or analyze. My initial instinct, as a seasoned professional, is to consider the possibility of a missing section. Perhaps I'm supposed to be looking at "PART I" or something, and it's on a separate page, which I overlooked.

Let's dive deeper. My next move is to check other nearby pages. Let's start with `page_7.md` and see if there are any hints. Hmm, a potential header leak... "This page intentionally left blank Brands and Brand Management 29". Okay, so it looks like it's a genuine intentionally blank page and that it's leaking header information.

Next, I'll move on and check `page_9.md`, which contains the text "Prologue: Branding Is Not Rocket Science 19". This text clearly does *not* match anything else.

Finally, I'll check `page_20.md`, which is clearly a part of this sequence, though I'm not sure why it's been selected.

I have yet to see any meaningful information to process.

**Analyzing the Grep Output**

Right, so the initial `grep` results seem to be dominated by Table of Contents entries, but there are a few other files that are standing out. I'm seeing `/page_65.md` and `/page_75.md` listed under *both* PART I and PART II, which is immediately suspicious. That doesn't make any sense. And there's `/page_473.md` listed under PART V.

My instinct is to check those pages, `page_65.md` and `page_75.md`, directly. But, before I do that, let me step back for a moment. This might be a mistake.

Instead, I'm going to quickly look for the *actual* Part headings in the text themselves, to get a better understanding of the overall structure. It's possible the authors used a consistent all-caps format, or perhaps a specific style for those headers, and that'll give me a more accurate picture than these preliminary matches.

Okay, let's refine this a bit, by grepping for those exact part titles:

*   "Opening Perspectives"
*   "Developing a Brand Strategy"
*   "Designing and Implementing Brand Marketing Programs"
*   "Measuring and Interpreting Brand Performance"
*   "Growing and Sustaining Brand Equity"
*   "Closing Perspectives"

That should give me a much better perspective on where these pages actually belong, and hopefully clear up this initial confusion.

**Investigating Part Header Visibility**

Alright, it's becoming clear that pinpointing those "Part" headers with these exact search terms within the main text files isn't as straightforward as it should be. It's either a case of the strings not appearing *exactly* as expected, or, more likely, they're confined to the Table of Contents. This indicates a potential issue with the search methodology. We need to confirm whether the page text of each chapter contains the part label.

So, let's zero in on `page_65.md` as a test case. That'll give us a practical point of reference to understand how these parts are structured and where their identifiers reside. I want to see if we can find any clues about the formatting here, the presence of the header labels in the main text, or if it's strictly a TOC-level declaration. Let's see what `page_65.md` reveals.

  **Navigating the Text's Structure**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the layout here. I saw that `page_65.md` contains "PART I • OPENING PERSPECTIVES" and that seemed out of place, given that's typically at the beginning of a section. I initially thought it might be at the end of Chapter 1, but I just confirmed Chapter 1 *started* on `page_30.md`, and the Table of Contents said the chapter *begins* on page 29. So there's an offset here of +1 between the ToC and the file naming. The text also includes "Notes," which is often placed at the end of a chapter.

Wait a second... actually, a lot of textbooks I've worked with do put the Part header on the first page of *each* chapter within that part. So, `page_65.md` having "PART I" might be perfectly normal in this structure. Need to get a better handle on this. I'll check `page_68.md` and see if that confirms my suspicion about the formatting.

Okay, so I'm looking at these files and need to make sure the page numbers are consistent. First up, `page_68.md`. The table of contents says Chapter 2 starts on page 67, but this file is named `page_68.md`. A simple offset of +1, which is common in these sorts of systems, makes the file name correct. That seems straightforward and expected. Now, I should double check to ensure that line 11 in this file contains the actual title; that's the next logical step.

Now, let's switch gears and investigate `page_107.md`. I should perform the same validation on this file.

  Here's my take on the thought process:

**Chapter Navigation and Metadata Verification**

Okay, so I'm looking at this file, `page_107.md`. The table of contents tells me Chapter 3 begins on page 106, which makes perfect sense because it's an offset. So, adding that +1 confirms `page_107.md` is the file for that chapter. All good so far. Just a quick sanity check to ensure the indexing is aligned. I see that Line 11 is the title, and it is correct. Now, let's turn our attention to the next file `page_142.md`. I wonder what information it contains.

  Here's my thought process, as if I were considering this myself:

**Navigating the Document Structure**

Okay, so I'm looking at `page_142.md`. The table of contents indicates that it should be on page 141, but that's a common indexing offset error. Checking the ToC confirms that an offset of +1 is expected. So, assuming it is chapter four, then the ToC is correct, and my current file is the correct one. I'll need line 11 for the title later.

But hold on, before I jump in further, I need to check for a "PART III" header. The ToC indicates that "PART III" begins on page 141. So, it's either going to be on `page_141.md` or, potentially, on `page_142.md`, the start of Chapter 4. Best to look at `page_141.md` first to determine the structure.

  Okay, here's my summarized thought process, presented as if I'm analyzing this:

**Analyzing the Missing "PART" Header**

Hmm, there's no "PART" header on `page_141.md`. That's a bit odd, isn't it? My immediate instinct is to think, "Well, maybe it *is* there, just not in the format I was expecting." Perhaps it's not simply a top-level header but part of a deeper section.

So, instead of just assuming it's absent, I'm going to take a more systematic approach. My next step will be to actively search for any variations of "PART" within the headers of the whole document.

I'll use `grep`, because that's the most efficient tool for this kind of pattern-matching on text. I'll add context to my `grep` command, just to make sure I don't miss anything that might be related, and to confirm whether it is actually there. With this approach, I should be able to quickly determine if there are any "PART" headers, even if they're formatted in a slightly unexpected way, and to see if the missing header on page 141 is part of a larger issue.

**My Immediate Assessment**

Okay, let's break this down. They've asked me to summarize some text, but specifically, to channel the internal monologue *as if* the thoughts were my own. Interesting. This isn't just about distilling the information; it's about interpreting and then *embodying* the thought process. I need to be sure the summary isn't just a restatement, but a genuine reflection of how *I* would approach understanding the core ideas, if the original thoughts were mine. I’ll make sure to add Roman numerals to match the original request.

💭 Thinking:
  **My Analysis of the Text's Structure**

Okay, so I'm diving into this text and immediately I need to understand how the sections are organized. I noticed these "PART" headers, but they're a bit deceptive. They don't always signal the true *beginning* of a section, sometimes appearing as footers or just in the Table of Contents. It seems like the "PART" headers are not exactly consistent.

My initial assumption was that Part I starts at Chapter 1, Part II at Chapter 2, Part III at Chapter 4, and so on. Now that I have gone through it, this assumption is correct!

To get a handle on this, I'm verifying the start of each key section: Prologue, Preface, Acknowledgments, About the Author, and then each Part (and its chapters) that follows. I am using the ToC entries and correlating them with the page numbers. I am adding a +1 offset to account for the actual content starting on the following page (the title pages). For each chapter, I need to know where the content *begins* (line 11 on the given page). This approach will enable me to extract the data systematically.

  **My Mental Road Map: Summarizing Keller's "Strategic Brand Management"**

Alright, let's get down to it. I've got a roadmap: a collection of Markdown files, each representing a page or a section of Keller's book. My task? To distill each piece into a concise summary, ultimately creating a structured JSON representation of the entire text. As a seasoned expert, I'm going to process it in batches to ensure thoroughness and clarity.

First, I'm checking that `page_577.md` is what I think it is: either blank or transitionary. Then, that `page_578.md` starts the Index. Got it. Now, batch by batch, here's how I'm thinking about breaking down this content.

### **Batch 1: Front Matter & Part I – Laying the Groundwork**

*   **Prologue:** Okay, Keller starts with a personal anecdote about his father, a rocket scientist. It's an analogy – branding, while not *literally* rocket science, is just as complex and requires the same kind of methodical approach and creative thinking to be successful. It's about combining art with science to improve the odds.
*   **Preface:** The core concept is brand equity. It's the added value a brand accumulates because of marketing investments. Keller's laying out three key questions that the book will answer: How to *create*, *measure*, and *sustain* this equity.
*   **Acknowledgments:** A quick nod to the team – Pearson, the editors, research assistants, and industry partners who helped bring this fourth edition to life.
*   **About the Author:** We get a biographical sketch of Keller. He's the E.B. Osborn Professor of Marketing at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, with a background in academia, research (especially on brand equity), and consulting gigs with big players like Nike and Coca-Cola. Solid credentials.
*   **PART I Opening Perspectives:** This is setting the stage. Branding's importance and the definition of a brand.
    *   **Chapter 1: Brands and Brand Management:** Okay, he’s defining what a brand *is* – differentiating it from a product – and why brands matter. To consumers, it’s about simplifying choices. To firms, it's legal protection and a competitive edge. He addresses the realities of branding, such as savvy consumers and a fragmented media landscape.

### **Batch 2: Part II – Developing Brand Strategy**

*   **PART II Developing a Brand Strategy:** Now, he's diving into the heart of the matter – how to position a brand and build resonance.
    *   **Chapter 2: Customer-Based Brand Equity and Brand Positioning:** Here's the Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) model. Brand positioning, for Keller, is a deliberate effort to create a distinct image in the minds of the target consumer. It's about points-of-parity (POPs) and points-of-difference (PODs), of course.
    *   **Chapter 3: Brand Resonance and the Brand Value Chain:** It seems he’s breaking brand building down into a four-step process: identity, meaning, responses, and relationships. And, of course, the Brand Resonance Pyramid (Salience, Performance, Imagery, Judgments, Feelings, Resonance). The Brand Value Chain gives us a way to track how value is created.

### **Batch 3: Part III – Implementing Marketing Programs**

*   **PART III Designing and Implementing Brand Marketing Programs:** This is the tactical side of things – the marketing activities used to grow that brand equity.
    *   **Chapter 4: Choosing Brand Elements to Build Brand Equity:** Here he's laying out the criteria for selecting brand elements—those memorable names, logos, characters, slogans, and packaging—all of which must be memorable, meaningful, likeable, transferable, adaptable, and protectable.
    *   **Chapter 5: Designing Marketing Programs to Build Brand Equity:** This is all about how product, pricing, and channel strategies can build equity. He addresses the importance of "aftermarketing" and perceived quality.
    *   **Chapter 6: Integrating Marketing Communications to Build Brand Equity:** A close look at today's communication landscape—advertising, promotions, online, events, mobile. Introduces Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC).
    *   **Chapter 7: Leveraging Secondary Brand Associations to Build Brand Equity:** How can you borrow some equity by linking up with other entities (companies, countries, channels, celebrities, events).

### **Batch 4: Part IV – Measuring and Interpreting Brand Performance**

*   **PART IV Measuring and Interpreting Brand Performance:** Now we get into the assessment of brand health.
    *   **Chapter 8: Developing a Brand Equity Measurement and Management System

Alright, let's see, the structure is fairly straightforward. I'm looking for the "Closing Observations" section – a quick scan confirms that it's located precisely at line 11. Good, that's where I expected it to be. Now, just to be thorough and ensure I've got the full picture, I'll need to double-check Chapter 14 as well. It's best to be comprehensive when analyzing this, especially in the context of [your field], so a quick cross-reference will provide the full context that I need.

Alright, let's break this down. The instruction is very direct; I'm being given a couple of very specific markers. The initial "Yes, line 11" immediately tells me I need to focus on a particular text or data set and zoom in on line 11 of that document. I know to expect a detailed piece of information in that line. Whatever context I'm in will be absolutely vital to understand the significance of this.

Then, there's "One more: Chapter 13." This is even less specific, but it points me to a larger scope. I know I have a document I need to reference, and it must have chapters. I need to now find the chapter 13, and this is where the important information will be contained. I need to focus my mental attention on these distinct pieces of information.

Okay, here's what's running through my head. Line 11, yes. That's a key reference point. Now, I need to get this structured properly. Time to build out the JSON, I can visualize the hierarchy of this content.

First, I need to organize this into its core components. I see a clear structure here: we have Parts, each encompassing a set of Chapters. Then, there are a few stand-alone sections at the beginning and the end. I need to make sure to account for those. Prologue, Preface, Acknowledgments, About the Author, Epilogue, and Index - they need to be slotted in appropriately.

Wait a second, let me re-think this... those "Parts" themselves, like "PART I Opening Perspectives" should be nodes in the structure. Need to make sure I represent that correctly.

I recall I already identified where the Part headers are. I just checked `page_65.md` and confirmed "PART I • OPENING PERSPECTIVES" is on line 11. Now, let's just confirm where PART II starts. Let me check `page_75.md` . Got it.

  **Analyzing the Section Headers**

Okay, so I'm looking at these files and I'm trying to figure out the structure of this document, specifically how the "Parts" and "Chapters" are organized. I noticed that `page_75.md` has "PART II • DEVELOPING A BRAND STRATEGY" at line 11, which seems odd because I thought Chapter 2 starts on page 67 according to the Table of Contents. Then again, Chapter 2 is a *part* of Part II, so I would expect the Part header to come *before* the first chapter.

The Table of Contents clearly lists "PART II ... 67", and Chapter 2 also says "Chapter 2 ... 67". So ideally, both should start on page 67. But, `page_68.md` (which is presumably page 67, based on the ToC) only includes "Chapter 2". No "PART II" at all. I need to recheck `page_68.md`. Ah yes, it only has the chapter header.

Hold on, `page_75.md` *does* have the "PART II" header. It's likely this is the part header that *appears* on every page of that particular section.

Let me test this hypothesis: I'm going to jump ahead and check `page_142.md` to see if it starts with "PART III." No, it doesn't. And then I'll check `page_292.md` for "PART IV." Still no, it's missing. Looks like the part header is *only* on `page_75.md`

💭 Thinking:
  **Structuring the Document Outline**

Okay, so I'm finally getting a handle on the structure here. Parts are definitely logical groupings of chapters, just as I suspected. I need to represent this in a JSON format for easy access, and it's looking like a parent-child relationship between Parts and Chapters is the way to go.

Right, so for the `start_page_id` of each Part, I'll grab the page number of the very first chapter contained within it. Now, if there isn't an explicit Part header on that initial chapter's page, I can just grab the first line of the chapter start, or failing that, line 11 as a fallback. I'll need to figure out which approach is best after looking at the data.

Hold on a second... the "Brief Contents" on page 8 is really helpful! It provides explicit page numbers for *each* Part. That saves a lot of guesswork! Let me jot these down...

*   PART I: 29 -> `page_30.md`
*   PART II: 67 -> `page_68.md`
*   PART III: 141 -> `page_142.md`
*   PART IV: 291 -> `page_292.md`
*   PART V: 385 -> `page_386.md`
*   PART VI: 547 -> `page_548.md`

Okay, fantastic! I can use those page numbers directly to create the filenames. I'll take a look at `page_386.md` to confirm the structure - specifically, is Chapter 11 where I expect it? That will confirm I am on the right path.

💭 Thinking:
  **My JSON Blueprint: A Branding Masterclass**

Okay, everything's lining up. The data's all there, and I'm ready to craft that `global_map.json` file. My goal here is to ensure these summaries are detailed and truly reflect the depth of these concepts.

Here's my mental walkthrough of the material, a refresher before I translate it into the file:

*   **Prologue:** I'm seeing this as a personal touch, the "art and science" blend, stressing that branding is about *doing* as much as theory. Implementation is the key.
*   **Preface:** I'm crystal clear on this: Brand equity is all about that "added value" from marketing. My focus is on how it's created, measured, and sustained.
*   **About the Author:** Time to present Kevin Lane Keller’s bio: I'm making sure to highlight his key works, like *Strategic Brand Management* and *Marketing Management*, and the impact his consulting has had on the field.
*   **Chapter 1:** The fundamentals! The difference between a product and a brand. Brands are a form of risk reduction and identification, but they face challenges from informed customers, brand proliferation, and media fragmentation.
*   **Chapter 2:** The Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) framework! It's about that differential effect of brand knowledge. Positioning is essential: Points-of-Parity (POPs) and Points-of-Difference (PODs) are key. Also, brand mantras are useful for internal and external clarity.
*   **Chapter 3:** The Brand Resonance Pyramid. This is my go-to: from Identity (Salience) to Meaning (Performance/Imagery), Response (Judgments/Feelings), all the way to Relationships (Resonance). The Brand Value Chain model is also worth highlighting.
*   **Chapter 4:** Brand elements are vital: names, URLs, logos, characters, slogans, jingles, and packaging. I'll make sure to note the criteria of memorability, meaningfulness, likability, transferability, adaptability, and protectability.
*   **Chapter 5:** I'm considering the marketing programs (product, price, distribution). Relationship marketing, mass customization, aftermarketing, and value-based pricing are all on the list.
*   **Chapter 6:** Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)! The communication options: advertising, sales promotion, online/mobile, events. The key to making these choices lies in those IMC criteria: coverage, contribution, commonality, complementarity, conformability, and cost.
*   **Chapter 7:** I'll be clear about leveraging secondary associations, borrowing equity. Companies, countries, distribution channels, co-branding, licensing, celebrity endorsements, and events.
*   **Chapter 8:** Brand equity measurement: brand audits (inventory and exploratory), tracking studies (awareness and image over time). It’s all about a Brand Equity Management System (Brand Charter, Report, Responsibilities).
*   **Chapter 9:** Qual and Quant research are my bread and butter. Qualitative: free association, projective techniques, ZMET, neural research. Quantitative: recognition/recall, image associations, multi-dimensional scaling.
*   **Chapter 10:** Comparative methods: brand-based, blind tests; marketing-based, conjoint analysis. Holistic methods, like residual approaches, valuation: Interbrand/Prophet are worth considering.
*   **Chapter 11:** Brand architecture: the brand-product matrix, brand portfolios (flankers, cash cows, low-end entry level, high-end prestige). I'm also thinking of brand hierarchies (corporate, family, individual brands), corporate branding, and cause marketing.
*   **Chapter 12:** Brand extensions: line vs. category extensions. The pros (lower risk, feedback) and cons (cannibalization, dilution), along with academic research guidelines, are all important.
*   **Chapter 13:** Long-term management: brand reinforcement (consistency). Brand revitalization (repositioning, expanding awareness). Adjustments to the portfolio (migration, retirement) must be noted.
*   **Chapter 14:** Global branding: the rationale for international expansion. Standardization vs. customization. Global brand equity. I’m thinking in particular of developing markets like China and India.
*   **Chapter 15:** A synthesis of brand management principles, Brand Report Card (10 criteria). Six future brand imperatives. Finding that "branding sweet spot" is key.

Now, with this mental map set, I'm ready to write that file.

💭 Thinking:
  **Global Map Creation: A Success**

Alright, I've got it. The `global_map.json` file is locked and loaded. Thinking back, the process was pretty textbook. It went down exactly as planned:

First, the **RECONNAISSANCE** phase. I zeroed in on the Table of Contents on those pages, 8 through 19, and mapped the terrain. From there, it was **TARGET ACQUISITION**. I quickly confirmed that +1 offset between the ToC page numbers and the corresponding file IDs, verifying start pages and line indices for all the major sections. That offset is key to the overall framework, and it's good to have it verified.

Then came **CONTEXTUALIZATION**. That's where things really came alive. I generated detailed, concept-rich summaries for each section and chapter. It's the crux of understanding the whole work, and essential for any effective navigation tool.

Finally, the **ARTIFACT GENERATION** phase. I wrote the full JSON output to `/global_map.json`. It's done.

Now, I'll update the task list and mark those todos as completed. Time to move on to the next challenge.
