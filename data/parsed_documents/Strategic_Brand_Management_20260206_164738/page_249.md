Numerous firms are embracing this broad-based approach to developing their communications program. Kellogg launched its largest integrated marketing campaign ever in Q1 2011.86 The campaign, called “Share Your Breakfast,” included a Web site where consumers could upload pictures of their breakfast and for which Kellogg, in turn, would donate a meal through a partnership with the nonprofit, Action for Healthy Kids. In addition to the Web site, the campaign included broadcast, digital, social, and print media. Kellogg worked with several different agencies across different media. The campaign extended to specific retailer promotions and applied across many of the company’s brands.

## Criteria for IMC Programs

In assessing the collective impact of an IMC program, the marketer’s overriding goal is to create the most effective and efficient communication program possible. Here are six relevant criteria, known as “the 6 Cs” for short:87

1. **Coverage**  
2. **Contribution**  
3. **Commonality**  
4. **Complementarity**  
5. **Conformability**  
6. **Cost**

After considering the concept of coverage and how it relates to the other five criteria, let’s look quickly at each in turn.

### Coverage.

Coverage is the proportion of the audience reached by each communication option, as well as how much overlap exists among communication options. In other words, to what extent do different communication options reach the designated target market, and the same or different consumers making up that market? As Figure 6-6 shows, the unique aspects of coverage relate to the direct main effects of any communication; the common aspects relate to the interaction or multiplicative effects of two communication options working together.

The unique aspect of coverage is the inherent communication ability of a marketing communication option, as suggested by the second criterion, contribution. If there is some overlap in communication options, however, marketers must decide how to design their communication program to reflect the fact that consumers may already have some communication effects in memory prior to exposure to any particular communication option.

This table outlines three distinct communication options (A, B, and C) that are all presented as serving a common "Audience." Option A is presented as a singular choice, while Options B and C are also presented as individual alternatives. The structure suggests a comparative analysis of these communication strategies, all directed towards a unified recipient group. The overarching theme is the presentation of multiple communication pathways, implying a decision-making process where one of these options would be selected to engage the specified audience.
