For example, Progressive has become one of the most successful auto insurers, in part due to consistent innovations in service. A pioneer in direct sales of insurance online, the firm was the first to offer prospective customers the ability to instantly compare price quotes from up to three other insurers. Other Progressive innovations include an accident “concierge service” through which its representatives handle all aspects of the claims and repair process for its customers, and online policy management that lets customers make payments and change coverage at any time. See Branding Brief 13-1 for a summary of how Gillette has built equity in its razor and blades categories through innovation.

Failure to innovate can have dire consequences. Smith Corona, after struggling to sell its typewriters and word processors in a booming personal computer market, finally filed for bankruptcy. As one industry expert observed, “Smith Corona never realized they were in the document business, not the typewriter business. If they had understood that, they would have moved into software.”<sup>8</sup> Guitar Hero was once touted as the first game franchise of the twenty-first century, but oversaturation and an inability to introduce engaging new products led its owner Activision to shutter the division after lackluster 2010 holiday sales.<sup>9</sup>

Product innovations are therefore critical for performance-based brands whose sources of equity reside primarily in product-related associations. In some cases, product advances may include brand extensions based on a new or improved product ingredient or feature. In fact, in many categories, a strong family sub-brand has emerged from product innovations associated with brand extensions (such as Wilson Hammer wide-body tennis racquets). In other cases, product innovations may center on existing brands. For example, General Mills’ “Big G” cereal division historically strived to improve at least a third of its nearly two dozen brand lines each year.

At the same time, it is important not to change products too much, especially if the brand meaning for consumers is wrapped up in the product design or makeup. Recall the strong consumer resistance encountered by New Coke, described in Chapter 1. In making product changes to a brand, marketers want to reassure loyal consumers that it is a better product, but not necessarily a *different* one. The timing of the announcement and the introduction of a product improvement are also important: if the brand improvement is announced too soon, consumers may stop buying existing products; if too late, competitors may already have taken advantage of the market opportunity with their own introductions.

### Non-Product-Related Imagery Associations.

For brands whose core associations are primarily non-product-related attributes and symbolic or experiential benefits, relevance in user and usage imagery is especially critical. Because of their intangible nature, non-product-related

Although once hugely popular—Annie Leunghe shown here had the highest score on Guitar Hero 3 for a female—the Guitar Hero brand eventually suffered from a lack of engaging new products to attract and retain users.
