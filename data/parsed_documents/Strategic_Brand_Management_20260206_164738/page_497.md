Another opportunity to increase frequency of use occurs when consumers’ *perceptions* of their usage differ from the reality. For many products with relatively short life spans, consumers may fail to buy replacements soon enough or often enough. Here are two possible solutions:

* Tie the act of replacing the product to a certain holiday, event, or time of year. For example, several brands, such as Oral-B toothbrushes, have run promotions tied in with the springtime switch to daylight saving time.
* Provide consumers with better information about either (1) when they first used the product or need to replace it, or (2) the current level of product performance. For example, batteries offer built-in gauges that show how much power they have left, and toothbrushes and razors have color indicators to indicate when they have worn out.

Finally, perhaps the simplest way to increase usage occurs when it is at less than the optimal or recommended level. Here, we want to persuade consumers of the merits of more regular usage and overcome any potential hurdles to increased usage, such as by making product designs and packaging more convenient and easier to use.

### Identifying New and Completely Different Ways to Use the Brand.

The second approach to increasing frequency of use is to identify completely new and different applications. Food product companies have long advertised new recipes that use their branded products in entirely different ways. Perhaps the classic example of finding creative new applications is Arm & Hammer baking soda, whose deodorizing and cleaning properties have led to a number of new uses.

Other brands have taken a page from Arm & Hammer’s book: Clorox has run ads stressing the many benefits of its bleach, such as how it eliminates kitchen odors; Wrigley’s chewing gum advertising touts it as a substitute for smoking; and Tums promotes its antacid’s benefits as a calcium supplement. Coach managed to expand usage and increase frequency for both the brand and the category, even in recessionary times.

## COACH

Coach has played a key role over the past decade in getting U.S. women to buy more handbags; most now make three new purchases annually. Coach’s strategy was to fill “usage voids”—situations where existing bag options were not appropriate—with a plethora of different bag options for almost every occasion, including evening bags, backpacks, satchels, totes, briefcases, coin purses, and duffels. Rather than owning a small number of bags suitable for a limited number of uses, women were encouraged to treat handbags as “the shoes of the 21st century: a way to frequently update wardrobes with different styles without shelling out for new clothes.” When the recession of 2008 challenged many providers of luxury fashion accessories, who began to introduce steep discounts, Coach was an exception. The company maintained prices on its regular product lines and instead introduced new low-priced items. Coach always conducts much research, and here it engaged with consumers to confirm two facts: First, the new products would not cheapen or damage its image. Second, the resulting decreases in margin would be more than offset by increases in volume. Through renegotiated deals with suppliers, new sources of leather, fabric, and hardware, and other steps, the company assured itself the handbags could have the proper designs at the necessary price points. Thus, the youthful and somewhat eclectic Poppy line was launched with an average price of $260, about 20 percent less than the typical Coach purse. The percentage of sales of low-priced handbags increased from about one-third to one-half of sales as a result of the shift in consumer willingness to pay. Handbags make up almost two-thirds of Coach sales.

Coach’s introduction of the youthful Poppy line at a lower price point helped the company weather a tough recession.
