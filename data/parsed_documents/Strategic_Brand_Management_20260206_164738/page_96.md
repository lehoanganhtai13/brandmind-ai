# BRANDING BRIEF 2-3

## Disney Brand Mantra

In the late 1980s, Disney became concerned that some of its characters, like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, were being used inappropriately and becoming overexposed. To investigate the severity of the problem, Disney undertook an extensive brand audit. As part of a brand inventory, it first compiled a list of all Disney products that were available (licensed and company manufactured) and all third-party promotions (complete with point-of-purchase displays and relevant merchandising) from stores across the country and all over the world. At the same time, Disney launched a major consumer research study—a brand exploratory—to investigate how consumers felt about the Disney brand.

The results of the brand inventory revealed some potentially serious problems: the Disney characters were on so many products and marketed in so many ways that in some cases it was difficult to discern the rationale behind the deal to start with. The consumer study only heightened Disney’s concerns. Because of the broad exposure of the characters in the marketplace, many consumers had begun to feel that Disney was exploiting its name. In some cases, consumers felt that the characters added little value to products and, worse yet, involved children in purchase decisions that they would typically ignore.

Because of its aggressive marketing efforts, Disney had written contracts with many of the “park participants” for copromotions or licensing arrangements. Disney characters were selling everything from diapers to cars to McDonald’s hamburgers. Disney learned in the consumer study, however, that consumers did not differentiate between all the product endorsements. “Disney was Disney” to consumers, whether they saw the characters in films, records, theme parks, or consumer products. Consequently, *all* products and services that used the Disney name or characters had an impact on Disney’s brand equity. Consumers reported that they resented some of these endorsements because they felt that they had a special, personal relationship with the characters and with Disney that should not be handled so carelessly.

As a result of the brand audit, Disney moved quickly to establish a brand equity team to better manage the brand franchise and more carefully evaluate licensing and other third-party promotional opportunities. One of the mandates of this team was to ensure that a consistent image for Disney—reinforcing its key brand associations—was conveyed by all third-party products and services. To facilitate this supervision, Disney adopted an internal brand mantra of “fun family entertainment” to serve as a screening device for proposed ventures.

Opportunities that were not consistent with the brand mantra—no matter how appealing—were rejected. For example, Disney was approached to cobrand a mutual fund in Europe that was designed as a way for parents to save for the college expenses of their children. The opportunity was declined despite the consistent “family” association, because Disney believed that a connection with the financial community or banking suggested other associations that were inconsistent with its brand image (mutual funds are rarely intended to be entertaining!).

The *brand functions* term describes the nature of the product or service or the type of experiences or benefits the brand provides. It can range from concrete language that reflects the product category itself, to more abstract notions (like Nike’s and Disney’s), where the term relates to higher-order experiences or benefits that a variety of different products could deliver. The **descriptive modifier** further clarifies its nature. Thus, Nike’s performance is not just any kind (not artistic performance, for instance) but only *athletic* performance; Disney’s entertainment is not just any kind (not adult-oriented) but only *family* entertainment (and arguably an additional modifier, “magical,” could add even more distinctiveness).
