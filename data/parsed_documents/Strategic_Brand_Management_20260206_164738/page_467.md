The simultaneous introduction of two brand extensions (e.g., two digital cameras) had an effect on consumer evaluations of the extensions independent of their similarity or fit to the parent brand (e.g., Xerox). Consumers appear to view a related set of products from a single manufacturer as inherently appealing.⁹⁴ Mao and Krishnan point out that consumers may form their perceptions of extension fit very differently when a brand operates in multiple product domains.⁹⁵

**11. An unsuccessful extension hurts the parent brand only when there is a strong basis of fit between the two.** The general rule of thumb emerging from academic research and industry experience is that an unsuccessful brand extension can damage the parent brand only when there is a high degree of similarity or fit—for example, in the case of a failed line extension in the same category.

Roedder John and Loken found that perceptions of quality for a parent brand in the health and beauty aids area decreased with the hypothetical introduction of a lower-quality extension in a similar product category (shampoo). Quality perceptions of the parent brand were unaffected, however, when the proposed extension was in a dissimilar product category (facial tissue).⁹⁶

Similarly, Keller and Aaker, as well as Romeo, found that unsuccessful extensions in dissimilar product categories did not affect evaluations of the parent brand.⁹⁷ When the brand extension is further removed, it seems easier for consumers to compartmentalize the brand’s products and disregard its performance in what is seen as an unrelated product category.

Additional research reinforces and amplifies this conclusion. Roedder John, Loken, and Joiner found that dilution effects were less likely to be present with flagship products; they occurred with line extensions but were not always evident for more dissimilar category extensions.⁹⁸

Gürhan-Canli and Maheswaran extended the results of these studies by considering the moderating effect of consumer motivation and extension typicality.⁹⁹ In high-motivation conditions, they found that incongruent extensions were scrutinized in detail and led to the modification of family brand evaluations, regardless of the typicality of the extensions. In low-motivation conditions, however, brand evaluations were more extreme in the context of high (than low) typicality. Because consumers considered the less typical extension an exception, it had reduced impact.

Consistent with these high-motivation findings, Milberg and colleagues found that negative feedback effects were present when (1) consumers perceived extensions as belonging to product categories dissimilar from those associated with the family brand, and (2) extension attribute information was inconsistent with image beliefs that consumers associated with the family brand.¹⁰⁰

In terms of individual differences, Lane and Jacobson found some evidence of a negative reciprocal impact from brand extensions, especially for high-need-for-cognition subjects, but did not explore extension similarity differences.¹⁰¹ Kirmani, Sood, and Bridges found dilution effects with owners of prestige-image automobiles when low-priced extensions were introduced, but not with owners of nonprestige automobiles or nonowners of either automobile.¹⁰²

Finally, Morrin examined the impact of brand extensions on the strength of parent brand associations in memory. Two computer-based studies revealed that exposing consumers to brand extension information strengthened rather than weakened parent brand associations in memory, particularly for parent brands that were dominant in their original product category. Higher fit also resulted in greater facilitation, but only for non-dominant parent brands. Moreover, the advertised introduction of an extension did not improve memory of the parent brand as much as the same level of advertising directly promoting the parent.¹⁰³

**12. An unsuccessful extension does not prevent a firm from backtracking and introducing a more similar extension.** The Keller and Aaker study also showed that unsuccessful extensions do not necessarily prevent a company from retrenching and later introducing a more similar extension. The failure of Levi’s Tailored Classics is instructive in that regard.
