their trademarks to local companies, entering into joint ventures, or creating wholly owned subsidiaries. *Rolling Stone* has 20 international editions outside the United States; *Maxim* has 27 overseas editions; and *Elle* has 42 editions targeting the same demographic group but tailored to the country where each is published.

Each country has its own unique media challenges and opportunities. When Colgate-Palmolive decided to further penetrate the market of the 630 million or so people who lived in rural India, the company had to overcome the fact that more than half of all Indian villagers are illiterate and only one-third live in households with television sets. Its solution was to create half-hour infomercials carried through the countryside in video vans. [38] To sell Tampax tampons in Mexico, Procter & Gamble created in-home informational gatherings or “bonding sessions” akin to Tupperware parties led by company-designated counselors. Although about 70 percent of women in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe used tampons, just 2 percent of women in most of Latin America did. To overcome cultural inhibitors, P&G developed its unorthodox approach. [39]

Sponsorship programs have a long tradition in many countries outside the United States because of a historical lack of advertising media there. Increasingly, marketers can execute sponsorship on a global basis. Entertainment and sports sponsorships can be an especially effective way to reach a younger audience.

**Distribution Strategy.** Channels present challenges to many firms because there are few global retailers, especially supermarkets and grocery stores, although some progress has been made with Germany’s Aldi and France’s Carrefour. Established British retailers Sainsbury, Tesco, and Marks and Spencer have all struggled to enter the U.S. market. The common English language may actually have been a barrier—assumptions were made about consumers that didn’t hold true on the other side of the Atlantic. In developing its Fresh & Easy store concept for California, Tesco found that U.S. shoppers liked to pick up and touch their fruit and vegetables and stock up with more frozen food than their British customers.

Lacking many global retail powerhouses, companies often differ in their approach to distribution, and the results can be dramatic. Coca-Cola’s intensive deployment of vending machines in Japan was a key to success in that market. From 1981 to 1993, Coca-Cola invested over $3 billion internationally in infrastructure and marketing.
