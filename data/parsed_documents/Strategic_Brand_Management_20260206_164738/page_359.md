This figure presents a comparative analysis of Google's new product introductions, specifically focusing on Chrome and Android, within a brand stature framework. The data is structured to visualize the relative success or positioning of these products. Chrome is positioned at the highest level of brand stature (100), with its associated category identified as "Google Mobile." Android by Google is also represented, though its specific positioning on the brand stature scale is not explicitly detailed in relation to Chrome's 100. Additionally, Google Buzz and Google News are depicted, with Google Buzz appearing to have a lower brand stature than Chrome, and Google News's stature also not precisely quantified in this visual. The overarching structure is comparative, using brand stature as the metric to differentiate and position these Google products.

Specifically, financial analysis of global brands has shown that brands that have consistently high Brand Strength and consistently high common meaning (attribute factor scores) will deliver better margin growth rates and are more efficient at producing higher pretax margins.

Google has achieved leadership status in global markets the same way it achieved leadership status in the USA—by quickly “maxing out” on Brand Strength and Brand Stature. In all countries recently surveyed, Google is a super-leadership brand on the PowerGrid (see Figure 9-20). Reviewing the key image factors across countries shows that Google ranks in the high 90s on each factor and each dimension, <i>according to consumers in each local market</i>. This is true consistency, which Google has built by focusing on the important factors within each local market.

This table presents a comparative analysis of brand imagery factors across different countries, focusing on three key dimensions: Superior, Customer Centric, and Cutting Edge. Each dimension is further defined by a set of associated attributes, such as "Obliging," "Gaining Popularity," and "Energetic." The table then provides percentile ranks for the USA across these three imagery factors, indicating a high standing in all categories (99.8 for Superior, 97.7 for Customer Centric, and 99.8 for Cutting Edge). A separate column, "Energized Brand Strength," is visually represented by flags of various countries and a numerical scale, suggesting a potential cross-national comparison or a measure of overall brand vitality, though specific data for this column is not detailed in the provided snippet. The structure is hierarchical, with broad imagery factors broken down into specific attributes and then quantified by country-specific percentile ranks.

This figure, "Google Is Consistently a Global Brand Leader," presents a comparative analysis of Google's brand strength across various countries. The data is structured around two primary axes: "Brand Stature," ranging from 0 to 100, and "Energized Brand Strength," also scaled from 0 to 100. The table lists several countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Russia, Japan, and Italy, with implicit data points indicating Google's standing on these metrics within each nation. While the specific values are not explicitly detailed in the provided table structure, the visual representation suggests a multi-dimensional assessment of Google's brand presence, likely illustrating how its stature and energized strength vary geographically, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating its global leadership.
