Handset makers are racing to produce ever better smartphones, with bigger and higher definition screens, faster processors, and easier access to social networks. These new technologies are creating more targeted, interactive, and useful mobile ads than ever before.⁶⁹

One of the fastest-growing areas in mobile ad spending is Apple’s new iAd mobile network, which allows marketers to place interactive banner ads in iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad software applications, or apps. Unilever successfully used iAd to promote its Dove soap. When touched, Unilever’s banner ad opened into a library of videos and other content promoting Dove. More than 20 percent of people who opened the ad returned to it a second time.⁷⁰ Many ads are also being developed for Google’s Android operating system.

Smartphones present a unique opportunity for marketers because they can be in consumers’ hands at the point of sale or consumption.⁷¹ IHOP restaurants experienced a 10 percent mobile coupon redemption rate with one of its campaigns. The goal of Domino’s mobile campaign was to increase awareness about the new Legends Pizza, drive foot traffic to store locations, and increase sales. A marketer can put different short-code key words into calls for consumers to text the various print and electronic media and then determine which ad medium is most effective in driving consumer awareness and interaction.

*Geotargeting* occurs when marketers take advantage of digital technology to send messages to consumers based on their location and the activities they are engaging in.⁷² A simple application uses Web IP addresses to display ads letting browsers know of opportunities in their area. Some of the more exciting recent developments include using mobile phones in this way as marketers strive to find when and how to reach consumers as they travel through their days.

Enormous privacy and regulatory concerns surround mobile advertising. *Opt-in* advertising will be key, whereby users agree to allow advertisers to use specific, individual information about time, location, and shopping preferences in order to send them targeted ads and promotions.⁷³ Increasingly, consumers are choosing to opt in to different services and share their locations in return for coupons, discounts, and more relevant promotional material and messages. One popular example is Foursquare.⁷⁴

## FOURSQUARE

Created in 2009 by Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai, Foursquare is a Web and mobile application that allows registered users to connect with friends and update their location. When they arrive at a restaurant, bar, or other site, users can “check in” and announce their location to others on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Points awarded for checking in at venues can be used for discounts and prizes. The title of “Mayor” is bestowed to users who check in the most times at a certain location over a 60-day period. Foursquare is experiencing rapid growth, as companies such as Starbucks, Bergdorf Goodman, and Crunch gyms have experimented with ways to leverage its location-based knowledge to offer customer promotions.
