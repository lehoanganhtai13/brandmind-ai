What they often need reassurance about, however—and what should often be the focus of the marketing program—is whether the extension also has the necessary points-of-parity.

For example, Nivea became a leader in the skin cream category by creating strong points-of-difference on the benefits of “gentle,” “mild,” “caring,” and “protective,” which consumers value in many categories. Through skillful product development and marketing, the Nivea brand was successfully expanded across a wide variety of skin care and personal care product categories. When it leveraged its brand equity into categories such as deodorants, shampoos, and cosmetics, Nivea found it necessary to establish category points-of-parity before it could promote its points-of-difference. These were of little value unless consumers believed its deodorant was strong enough, its shampoo would produce beautiful enough hair, and its cosmetics would be colorful enough. Once points-of-parity were established, Nivea’s core brand associations could be introduced as compelling points-of-difference.

### Contributing to Parent Brand Equity.

To contribute to parent brand equity, an extension must strengthen or add favorable and unique associations to the parent brand and not diminish the strength, favorability, or uniqueness of any existing associations. The effects of an extension on consumer brand knowledge will depend on four factors:

1. How *compelling* the evidence is about the corresponding attribute or benefit association in the extension context—that is, how attention-getting and unambiguous or easily interpretable the information is. Strong evidence is attention-getting and unambiguous. Weak evidence may be ignored or discounted.  
2. How *relevant* or diagnostic the extension evidence is for the attribute or benefit for the parent brand, that is, how much consumers see evidence on product performance or imagery in one category as predictive of product performance or imagery for the brand in other categories. Evidence will affect parent brand evaluations only if consumers feel extension performance is indicative of the parent brand in some way.  
3. How *consistent* the extension evidence is with the corresponding parent brand associations. Consistent extension evidence is less likely to change the evaluation of existing parent brand associations. Inconsistent extension evidence creates the potential for change, with the direction and extent of change depending on the relative strength and favorability of the evidence. Note, however, that consumers may discount or ignore highly inconsistent extension evidence if they don’t view it as relevant.<sup>37</sup>  
4. How *strongly* existing attribute or benefit associations are held in consumer memory for the parent brand, that is, how easy an association might be to change.

Feedback effects that change brand knowledge are thus most likely when consumers view information about the extension as equally revealing about the parent brand, and when they hold only a weak and inconsistent association between the parent brand and that information.<sup>38</sup> Note that negative feedback effects are not restricted to product-related performance associations. As we saw earlier, if a brand has a favorable prestige image association, then consumers may disapprove or even resent a vertical extension (a new version of the product at a lower price). Michelin is a premium brand that has extended carefully.

### MICHELIN

From its travel roots, Michelin, famous for the safety and dependability for its tires, has extended its brand into a variety of different categories. The company has long published guidebooks, the Red Guides to hotels and restaurants and the Green Guides for tourism. It has also published a series of road maps for locales and regions all over the world. More recently, a new division called Michelin Lifestyle began to sell additional licensed merchandise in four distinct areas:  
* (1) tire accessories, such as foot pumps, floor mats, and windshield wipers;  
* (2) “high-specification lifestyle products,” such as bicycle helmets, scuba suits, and golf balls;  
* (3) clothing and accessories featuring Michelin’s brand mascot Bibendum; and  
* (4) safety products developed with other companies, including ear plugs, safety goggles, and gloves.  

Michelin intended these brand extensions to “enhance the value of our brand and add emotional-type values, not just functionality, and reach out to…a new generation that doesn’t yet associate with us.” Still, Michelin Lifestyle management was careful not to stretch the brand too far by moving into “fragrances and other things that have some legitimacy for a lifestyle brand.
