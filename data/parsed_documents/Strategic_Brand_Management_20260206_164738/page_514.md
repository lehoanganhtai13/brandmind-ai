# BRANDING BRIEF 14-1

## Marketing to African Americans

Census and marketing surveys have revealed that African Americans represent almost 13 percent of the U.S. population, and their buying power will rise from $957 billion to $1.2 trillion—an increase of 25 percent—from 2010 to 2015. Although much marketing has targeted baby boomers, millennials, Hispanics, and other demographic and psychographic groups, many critics argue that firms have not effectively targeted the African American market. African Americans occupy every income, education, and geographic segment; 2.4 million affluent households (17 percent of the total) account for 45 percent of total African American buying power.

Because almost all African Americans speak English as their first language and watch much network television, many companies rely on general marketing campaigns to reach them. But unique attitudes and behaviors distinguish this audience. Black media executives such as Thomas Burrell, founder and chairman emeritus of Burrell Advertising in Chicago, the largest black-owned agency in the United States, says: “Black people aren’t dark-skinned white people. We have different preferences and customs, and we require special effort.” Many observers note the important role of religion, church, and family. As a result of their historical experiences, African Americans are often thought to exhibit a strong togetherness and pride in their heritage. They are also seen as style leaders who set fashion trends, especially among younger people.

African Americans spend a disproportionate amount of their income on apparel, footwear, and home electronics. They are more likely to spend money on luxury items such as cruise-ship vacations, new cars, and designer clothes. Many companies have capitalized on these purchasing preferences.

* Recognizing that African Americans often prefer larger helpings of sugar, cream, or nondairy creamer in their coffee, CoffeeMate began marketing to African Americans more specifically through black radio, magazines, and billboards, with a corresponding increase in sales.
* Recognizing that African Americans account for 30 percent of total U.S. hair care expenditures, L’Oréal made separate acquisitions of Soft Sheen Products and Carson Products to target that multi-billion-dollar market.
* Recognizing that Coke “over-indexes” or is comparatively bought more often in single-parent-family African American households, Coca-Cola targets African American moms in their role as gatekeeper.

African American consumers make a disproportionate amount of purchases of menthol cigarettes, certain types of hard liquors—brandy, scotch, cognac—and malt liquor beers. Alcohol and tobacco companies were among the first to specifically target this group, although these strategies have been somewhat controversial. Given that African Americans are prone to certain health risks, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, food and drug advertising often also specifically target them. Ads for St. Joseph Aspirin highlighted the fact that the product contains the dosage recommended by the Association of Black Cardiologists.

The challenge for building brand equity among African Americans is to create relevant marketing programs and communication campaigns that accurately portray brand personality and user and usage imagery and avoid fostering stereotypes, offending sensibilities, or lumping market segments together. The president of one black-owned agency says the formula for marketing to blacks consists of relevance, recognition, and respect. As with global brand programs in general, marketers should blend standardization and customization as appropriate.
