Rust and colleagues advocate customer-centered brand management to firms with the following directives that, they maintain, go against current management convention:

1. Make brand decisions subservient to decisions about customer relationships.  
2. Build brands around customer segments, not the other way around.  
3. Make your brands as narrow as possible.  
4. Plan brand extensions based on customer needs, not component similarities.  
5. Develop the capability and the mind-set to hand off customers to other brands in the company.  
6. Take no heroic measures to try to save ineffective brands.  
7. Change how you measure brand equity to make individual-level calculations.  

**Kumar and Colleagues.**  
In a series of studies, Kumar and his colleagues explore a number of questions concerning customer lifetime value and how firms should allocate their marketing spending to customer acquisition and retention efforts.[50] The authors show that marketing contacts across various channels influence CLV nonlinearly. Customers who are selected on the basis of their lifetime value provide higher profits in future periods than do customers selected on the basis of several other customer-based metrics. Kumar and his colleagues show how each customer varies in his or her lifetime value to a firm, and how customer lifetime value computations require different approaches depending on the business application. They also demonstrate how their framework, which incorporates projected profitability of customers in the computation of lifetime duration, can be superior to traditional methods such as the recency, frequency, and monetary value framework and past customer value.

**Relationship of Customer Equity to Brand Equity.**  
Brand equity management can be related to customer equity management in different ways. One way to reconcile the two points of view is to think of a matrix where all the brands and sub-brands and variants that a company offers are rows, and all the different customer segments or individual customers that purchase those brands are columns (see Figure 3-7). Effective brand and customer management would necessarily take into account both the rows and the columns to arrive at optimal marketing solutions.

**Differences Between the Two Points of View.**  
As they have been developed conceptually and put into practice, however, the two perspectives tend to emphasize different aspects (see Figure 3-8). The customer equity perspective puts much focus on the bottom-line financial value created by customers. Its clear benefit is the quantifiable measures of financial performance it provides. In its calculations, however, the customer equity perspective largely ignores some of the important advantages of creating a strong brand, such as the ability of a strong brand to attract higher quality employees, elicit stronger support from channel and supply chain partners, create growth opportunities through line and category extensions and licensing, and so on.  
The customer equity perspective also tends to be less prescriptive about specific marketing activities beyond general recommendations toward customer acquisition, retention, and cross-selling. The customer equity perspective does not always fully account for competitive response.

This table illustrates a brand segmentation strategy, depicting the relationship between multiple brands and various customer segments. The structure is organized with brands listed vertically (Brand 1, Brand 2, ..., Brand M) and customer segments arrayed horizontally (Segment 1, Segment 2, ..., Segment N). A key feature is the overarching "CUSTOMERS" category spanning multiple segments, suggesting a broader grouping of these individual segments. The visual representation, indicated by the shaded cells, highlights that each brand (Brand 1, Brand 2, and Brand M) is associated with all customer segments from Segment 1 through Segment N. This implies a comprehensive market coverage approach where each brand targets the entire spectrum of identified customer segments.
