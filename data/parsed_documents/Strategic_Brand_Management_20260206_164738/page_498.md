Sometimes they can arise from new packaging. For example, Arm & Hammer introduced a “Fridge-Freezer Pack” (with “freshflo vents”) for its natural baking soda that was specially designed to better freshen and deodorize refrigerators and freezers.

### Improving Brand Image

Although changes in brand awareness are probably the easiest means of creating new sources of brand equity, more fundamental changes are often necessary. We may need to create a new marketing program to improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations making up the brand image. As part of this repositioning—or recommitment to the existing positioning—we may need to bolster any positive associations that have faded, neutralize any negative associations that have been created, and create additional positive associations. These repositioning decisions require us to clearly specify the target market and the nature of the competition to set the competitive frame of reference.

#### Identifying the Target Market.

Marketers often focus on taking action with one or more of four key target market segments as part of a brand revitalization strategy:

1. **Retaining vulnerable customers**  
2. **Recapturing lost customers**  
3. **Identifying neglected segments**  
4. **Attracting new customers**

There is a clear hierarchy in these strategic targeting options. In an attempt to turn sales around, some firms mistakenly focus initially on the fourth one, chasing after new customers. This is the riskiest option. If it fails, two bad things can happen: the firm may fail to attract any new customers, but even worse, it may lose existing ones.

When Talbots, seller of women’s suits, blouses, and dresses in roughly 580 predominately suburban locations, ran into sales troubles after the 2008 recession, it decided to expand its target market. Bold jewelry and metallic suits appeared next to classic pearls and seasonal sweaters in an attempt to reach a younger audience than its traditional over-35-year-old woman. The result was a disaster that confused existing customers as well as hoped-for new prospects, and sales plunged. Asia’s leading chain of low-priced casual wear, Uniqlo, ran into the exact same predicament when stores began to stock too many fashion-forward items at the expense of popular basics.[19]

To avoid this double whammy and steady the course in the face of a sales decline, it is often best to try to halt the erosion first and ensure that no more customers are lost in the short run before chasing after new ones. Some of the same marketing efforts to retain existing customers can also help recapture lost customers who are no longer using the brand. This may mean simply reminding consumers of the virtues of a brand they have forgotten about or begun to take for granted. Recall how the New Coke debacle described in Chapter 1—although not intended to do so—accomplished just that, in a roundabout way. Kellogg’s Corn Flakes once ran a successful ad campaign with the slogan “Try Them Again for the First Time.”

The third approach—segmenting on the basis of demographic variables or other means and identifying neglected segments—is the next-most viable brand revitalization option. Of course, the final strategic targeting option for revitalizing a fading brand is simply to more or less abandon the consumer group that supported it in the past to target a completely new market segment.

Many firms have reached out to new customer groups to build brand equity. The Home Shopping Network (HSN) found success in going after fashion-oriented power shoppers by dumping a slew of unknown brands with me-too products to make the cable channel more designer-friendly to celebrities such as Badgley Mischka, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Stefani Greenfield, and Serena Williams.[20]

Market segments the firm currently serves with other products may represent potential growth targets for the brand. Effectively targeting these segments, however, typically requires some changes or variations in the marketing program, especially in advertising and other communications, and the decision whether to do so ultimately depends on the outcome of a cost–benefit analysis.
