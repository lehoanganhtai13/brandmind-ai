Besides direct expenditures, firms spent hundreds of millions more on related marketing efforts. A long-time Olympics supporter since the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, McDonald’s always runs a number of promotional campaigns to tie in with its sponsorship. Building on prior McDonald’s kids’ programs at the Olympic Games in Beijing and Vancouver, McDonald’s “Champions of Play for the Olympic Games” brought up to 200 children from around the world to London (each with a guardian) as part of a new global program to encourage a balanced approach to nutrition and activity for children.<sup>52</sup>

Participating McDonald’s countries initiated grassroots activities for children ages 6–10.

“For the first time ever, McDonald’s Champions of Play for the Olympic Games will tour and play with athletes at the actual Olympic venues,” said Kevin Newell, McDonald’s global chief brand officer. “This will be an unforgettable, inspiring moment for our champions, along with attending the Games, seeing McDonald’s Chef demonstrations, taking an exclusive tour of the Olympic Village dining area, visiting London’s cultural sites, and making new friends.”

McDonald’s Olympic Games program also targeted families across the globe through:

* A Web site offering balanced eating and fun play facts, and challenges.
* Digital engagement—allowing kids everywhere to track their physical activities online.
* Special Happy Meal packaging featuring information and tips on balanced eating and fun play.

McDonald’s also selected 2,000 of its top-performing restaurant staff from the UK and around the world—the largest Olympic team ever assembled—to serve the world’s top athletes, coaches, spectators, media, and officials at the Games. In 2012, these brand ambassadors had the opportunity to meet Olympic athletes, attend competitions, participate in their own sports and activities in the Royal Parks, visit cultural sites in London, and socialize with their international peers.

A relative newcomer beginning its sponsorship with the Vancouver Olympics in 2010, Procter & Gamble launched its “Proud Sponsor of Mums (or Moms)” campaign that it extended throughout P&G’s sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympic Games. P&G’s Olympic Games partnership is the first to cover multiple brands under one sponsor and will span the next 10 years, more than 30 product categories, and 205 National Olympic Committees to raise awareness of and reward mothers’ contributions globally.<sup>53</sup>

GE, Coca-Cola, Dow, Omega, and Visa have also extended their sponsorship through 2020. In announcing GE’s sponsorship, Jeff Immelt, chairman and CEO, stated, “The Olympic Games provide a unique opportunity to showcase our innovative technologies and services. Hosting a successful Olympic Games is a transformational opportunity for every host city. We are committed to working with the IOC and the local organizing committees to deliver world-class infrastructure solutions and a sustainable legacy to future generations.”

GE works closely with host countries, cities, and organizing committees to provide infrastructure solutions for Olympic Games venues including power, water treatment, transportation and security, and to supply hospitals with ultrasound and MRI equipment to help doctors treat athletes.<sup>54</sup>

### Sponsorship ROI

Although several firms have long-term relationships and commitments with the Olympics, in recent years other long-time sponsors have cut their ties. Kodak ended over a century of sponsorship after the Beijing Olympic Games, and General Motors ended its decades-long support at that time too. Other TOP partners that chose not to renew after the 2008 Games included Johnson & Johnson, Lenovo, and Manulife.

Although many factors affect the decision to engage in or renew an Olympic sponsorship, its marketing impact is certainly widely debated. For example, one survey of 1,500 Chinese city residents just prior to the 2008 Beijing Games revealed that only 15 percent could name two of the 12 global sponsors, and just 40 percent could name one: Coca-Cola. After virtually every Olympic Games, surveys show that many spectators at the Games and even avid viewers of the broadcasts mistakenly identify a nonsponsoring company as an official sponsor.<sup>55</sup>

### Ambush Marketing

In some cases, sponsorship confusion may be due to *ambush marketing*, in which advertisers attempt to give consumers the false impression they are Olympic sponsors without paying for the right to do so. Nonsponsoring companies attempt to attach themselves to the Games by, for instance, running Olympic-themed ads that publicize other forms of sponsorship like sponsoring a national team, by identifying the brand as an official supplier, or by using current or former Olympians as endorsers.<sup>56</sup>

For the Beijing Games, not only did popular former Chinese gymnastics champion Li Ning light the Olympic cauldron in the opening ceremony, he did so wearing shoes from the sportswear company he had founded. His actions drew tremendous attention to the Li Ning line while the official athletic sponsor, Adidas, which had spent millions for its rights, could only sit and watch. To improve the marketing effectiveness of sponsorship, the Olympic Committee has declared that it will vigorously fight ambush marketing. It has reduced the number of sponsors to avoid clutter.<sup>57</sup>

Containing ambush marketing requires much diligence. In the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, free Ocean Spray Cranberry Cocktail drinks were handed out to commuters at the Games as a promotion despite Coca-Cola’s being the official beverage sponsor. Bank of Nova Scotia launched a navigational mobile application to help people get around the Games while Royal Bank of Canada was the official banking sponsor, and Subway ran an advertising campaign featuring U.S. Olympic swim champion Michael Phelps although McDonald’s was the official restaurant of the Olympics. In each case, the IOC warned the offending company of employing ambush marketing tactics.<sup>58</sup>

### Beijing 2008 Summer Games

Every Olympic Games presents special opportunities for host countries and sponsoring companies. The 2008 Summer Games in Beijing held special appeal for some advertisers because the Games represented a connection to the burgeoning Chinese market. General Electric began its first global campaign revolving around the Beijing Games in 2005. GE chose the Olympics to position the company as global and innovative to Chinese consumers.
