Although many product categories may seem to be good candidates for a brand extension, as we will develop in greater detail in Chapter 12, marketers would be wise to heed the “Spandex Rule” espoused by Scott Bedbury, former VP-Advertising for Nike and VP-Marketing for Starbucks: “Just because you can . . . doesn’t mean you should!” Marketers must evaluate extending their brand carefully and launch new products selectively.

A “broad” brand is one with an abstract positioning that is able to support a higher-order promise relevant in multiple product settings. It often has a transferable point-of-difference, thanks to a widely relevant benefit supported by multiple reasons-to-believe or supporting attributes. For example, Delta Faucet Company has taken its core brand associations of “stylish” and “innovative” and successfully expanded the brand from faucets to a variety of kitchen and bathroom products and accessories.

Nevertheless, all brands have boundaries. It would be very difficult for Delta to introduce a car, tennis racquet, or lawnmower. Japanese carmakers Honda, Nissan, and Toyota chose to introduce their luxury brands in North America under new brand names, Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus, respectively. Even considering its own growth, Nike chose to purchase Cole Haan to sell into the dressier, more formal shoe market. Some brands have struggled to stretch into new markets, as did VW Phaeton.

## VW PHAETON

Auto industry insiders were surprised when VW chose to introduce the $85,000 VW Phaeton luxury sedan in 2002. Named after the son of the Greek god Helios, the vehicle racked up more than $1.3 billion in development costs. Although VW also owned Audi, management wanted to make the VW brand more upscale to better compete with BMW and Mercedes. But after Phaeton failed to meet sales goals in the United States—selling only 2,253 cars from 2004 to 2006—the brand was pulled from the market in 2006. After continuing to experience annual losses in the highly competitive U.S. market, VW announced in 2011 that it would relaunch a newly redesigned Phaeton at a later date, with a higher-quality interior, renewed front and rear exterior, and new engine choices. VW sees a strong presence in the U.S. luxury car segment as vital to its goals of tripling its share in the United States and surpassing Toyota worldwide in sales and profitability.⁴

To improve market coverage, companies target different segments with multiple brands in a portfolio. They have to be careful to not over-brand, however, or attempt to support too many brands. The trend among many top marketing companies in recent years has been to focus on fewer, stronger brands. Each should be clearly differentiated and appeal to a sizable enough market segment to justify its marketing and production costs.
