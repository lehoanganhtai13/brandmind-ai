# Reinforcing Brands

In considering these two topics, we’ll look at a number of different brand reinforcement issues and brand revitalization strategies. The Brand Focus 13.0 at the end of the chapter considers how to deal with a marketing crisis, with specific emphasis on Johnson & Johnson’s experiences with the Tylenol brand through the years.

How should we reinforce brand equity over time? How can marketers make sure consumers have knowledge structures that support brand equity for their brands? Generally, we reinforce brand equity by marketing actions that consistently convey the meaning of the brand to consumers in terms of brand awareness and brand image. As we have discussed before, questions marketers should consider are as follows:

* _What products does the brand represent, what benefits does it supply, and what needs does it satisfy?_ Nutri-Grain has expanded from cereals into granola bars and other products, cementing its reputation as “makers of healthy breakfast and snack foods.”
* _How does the brand make those products superior? What strong, favorable, and unique brand associations exist in the minds of consumers?_ Through product development and the successful introduction of brand extensions, Black & Decker is now seen as offering “innovative designs” in its small appliance products.

Both these issues—brand meaning in terms of products, benefits, and needs as well as in terms of product differentiation—depend on the firm’s general approach to product development, branding strategies, and other strategic concerns, as we discussed in Chapters 11 and 12. This section reviews some other important considerations for brand reinforcement, including the advantages of maintaining brand consistency, the importance of protecting sources of brand equity, and trade-offs between fortifying and leveraging brands.

If there is one rule for modern branding, however, it is that brands can never stand still. Brands must be constantly moving forward. A vivid example is the way Coldplay chose to launch their latest album.

## Coldplay

Having sold 55 million albums in their careers, British rock band Coldplay might find the release of a new album to be nothing special. After all, their fourth album *Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends* sold 2.8 million units in the United States alone, and their U.S. tour grossed more than $126 million.

When launching their fifth album, *Mylo Xyloto*, however, Chris Martin, lead singer and frontman for the band, noted how aggressively they had to approach the release. “Because of the speed of media and entertainment, with every album you have to think like a new act,” noted Martin, “just because they liked *A Rush of Blood to the Head* doesn’t mean they’re gonna like this one. So we start again.”

Before even launching a worldwide tour in 2012 that was scheduled to last over a year, the band had made 60 appearances of various sorts in 2011 to help promote the album: a video shoot in South Africa; a live-streamed *Amex Unstaged* launch show in Madrid shot by famed video and film director Anton Corbijn; a student union gig in Norwich, UK; guest spots on a host of U.S. talk shows; an acoustic show in a church in Hackney, East London; and headlining performances at the Q Music Awards and *X Factor* finale back in the UK. Performances of new songs appeared on YouTube and elsewhere. The band also released several singles online prior to the worldwide album release on October 24, 2011, all part of a viral campaign to generate fan interest and involvement. Leaving nothing to chance paid off for the band. *Mylo Xyloto* went to #1 in album sales in 17 countries, and most venues for the world tour sold out in minutes. The band did not stand still with respect to their world tour, either. In a concert first, each concertgoer received a RF-driven Xyloband flashing wristband that changed colors for different songs after receiving a signal.<sup>2</sup> Despite being one of the most successful bands in the world, Coldplay took nothing for granted in launching their *Mylo Xyloto* album.
