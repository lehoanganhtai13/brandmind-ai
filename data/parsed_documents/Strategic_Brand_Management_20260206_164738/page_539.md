# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 14-1

## Brand Recall and Language

A series of studies addressing this issue found significant differences in the ways Chinese- and English-speaking consumers processed brand names. In one study, Chinese speakers were more likely to recall brand names in written rather than spoken recall, whereas English speakers were more likely to recall the names in spoken rather than written recall; this suggests that mental representations of verbal information are coded mainly visually among Chinese and in a phonological manner among English speakers. Results for bilinguals depend on their proficiency with the languages.

Another study showed that more positive brand attributes resulted when peripheral features of a brand name (“script” aspects, such as the type of font employed, or “sound” aspects, such as the way the name is pronounced) matched the associations or meaning of the brand: Chinese native speakers were affected primarily by script matching, whereas English native speakers’ attitudes were primarily affected by sound matching. The researchers interpreted these results in terms of structural differences between logographic systems (such as Chinese, where characters stand for concepts and not sounds) and alphabetic systems (such as English, where the writing of a word is a close cue to its pronunciation) and their resulting visual and phonological representations in memory.

A related study investigated perceptions of brand names translated into Chinese. There are three possible types of translation for names. The first is phonetic: Chinese characters are used that sound most like the English word. The second is semantic: Chinese characters are chosen that approximate the meaning of the English word. The third is phono-semantic: a translation is formed that shares similarities in meaning and sound with the English original. It is common for products in China to use “bilingual” packaging that carries the brand name both in logographic form (Chinese characters) and in the English alphabet. Typically, a package will emphasize one name over the other by making it appear larger on the package. The study found that consumers preferred phonetic translations if a hypothetical product emphasized the English name, while they favored phono-semantic and semantic translations equally regardless of which name was emphasized.

A different study demonstrated that “classifiers,” a grammatical feature present in Chinese but not English, affected perceived similarity among objects and the way words are clustered upon recall. Chinese speakers were more likely to cluster names according to classifiers than English speakers, suggesting that judicious selection of classifiers could influence the way consumers perceive a brand. The study also showed that for Chinese speakers, images in hypothetical advertisements that corresponded with a classifier present in the ad copy were preferable to images that had no correspondence.

More likely to be helpful in creating brand awareness than brand image, however, which may require more explicit meaning and direct statements. If the meaning of a brand element is visually clear, it can be an invaluable source of brand equity worldwide. As the old saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” so it is not surprising that the right brand logo, symbol, or character can have a huge impact on global marketing effectiveness.

The image of Ronald McDonald clearly communicates McDonald’s association with kids without the need for words. Similarly, Mr. Peanut, the Apple logo, and the M&M characters need no translation. The Nike swoosh connotes sports, Coke’s contour bottle connotes refreshment, and the Mercedes star connotes status and prestige worldwide. Perhaps the most compelling example of the importance of brand symbols is the Marlboro man.
