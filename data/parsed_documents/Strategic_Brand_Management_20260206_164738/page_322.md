# Points-of-Parity  
They all make their watches in Switzerland, which is renowned for superior craftsmanship in watch making, and they all deliver high quality. All pride themselves on their attention to detail and ongoing innovation in the watch industry.

# Points-of-Difference  
Rolex separates itself from the competition in several ways. One, Rolex watches have a distinct look with their Crown logo, big face, and wide band. Two, Rolex has kept a strategically tight control on its distribution channel and production levels, creating a sense of prestige, importance, and exclusivity in the minds of consumers. Three, it has kept the brand pure, remaining focused only on watches and never licensing its name. Through careful selection of event sponsorships and brand ambassadors, Rolex has cut through the clutter, resonated with consumers around the world, and maintained an air of prestige.

# Brand Mantra  
Rolex has been extremely successful in building a global name through clever marketing and communications, without compromising the integrity of the brand. It has nurtured the belief that acquiring a Rolex represents a milestone in one’s life and has built a well-known brand recognized for its elegance and status throughout the entire world. A brand mantra that captures these ideas might be, “Classic Designs, Timeless Status.”

## TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS  
The Rolex brand audit proved that Rolex is a very strong brand with significant brand equity. It also identified a few opportunities and challenges:

### Leverage the Company’s Independent, Continuous Heritage and Focus  
* Rolex is the largest and most successful watch company in the world. As a result, many consumers don’t realize it is privately owned and competes against major conglomerates such as TAG Heuer’s parent company, LVMH, and OMEGA’s parent company, Swatch Group. While being privately owned is a good thing for many reasons, it also brings up several challenges. For example, Rolex has to compete against companies that are 10 times its size. Larger companies have lower labor costs, wider distribution, and significant advertising synergies.  
* Rolex may want to leverage and promote the fact that in some ways it has to work harder to succeed. It is doing what it has done for 100 years—making durable, reliable, premium watches on its own. Due to the currently popular anti-Wall Street vibe, this positioning may resonant well with consumers.

### Leverage the Company’s Elite Craftsmanship and Innovation  
* Research from the Luxury Institute group suggested that consumers do not consider Rolex the top brand in quality and exclusivity. History has proved that Rolex watches are in fact leaders in both craftsmanship and innovation and Rolex may want to run a campaign focused more on these aspects.

### Connect with the Female Consumer  
* Women make up the majority of jewelry and watch purchases. However, as Mintel’s 2008 study revealed, women are more and more interested in purchasing unisex mechanical watches rather than feminine-styled watches. This is a great opportunity for Rolex, whose watches are primarily masculine in design. The firm could move away from its decorative, jeweled watches and introduce more powerful, gender-neutral watches. Its 2009 Oyster Perpetual Datejust Rolesor 36 mm is one example—robust, with large utilitarian numbers, and waterproof to a depth of 100 meters.<sup>46</sup> However, its floral dial design and diamond-set bezel possibly give it an unnecessary feminine angle.  
* Rolex may want to tweak its female ambassador list to coincide with a more unisex product line. Women who have succeeded in a male-dominated environment such as Condoleezza Rice or Katie Couric could be powerful brand endorsers.

### Attack the Online Counterfeit Industry  
* Counterfeits damage the company’s brand equity and present a huge risk to the brand. The boom in e-commerce has taken counterfeit Rolexes from the street corner to the Internet, where fakes can reach far more consumers. Consequently, the age-old problem of counterfeiting is a bigger threat than ever before. To maintain its limited distribution, Rolex does not authorize any of its watches to be sold on the Internet. In order to combat the online sale of counterfeits, however, Rolex might consider building an exclusive online store, or an exclusive distribution site to which all official e-retailers must link. In fact, Rolex dedicates extensive resources to fight the illegal use of the brand, including sponsoring the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition and suing companies that allow the sale of counterfeit Rolexes.

### Use Marketing to Reach Younger Consumers  
* Research has shown that younger consumers do not value watches the same way older generations did. As a result, Rolex should be researching the questions: How will prestige be defined in the twenty-first century? Who or what symbolizes prestige, ruggedness, precision? Will the same formula work for the millennial generation as they age and move into the Rolex target market?

### Communicate Long-Term Value  
* Rolex competes for a share of the luxury buyer’s wallet with a host of other types of goods, such as clothes, shoes, and handbags. Many are less durable over time than a Rolex watch and are susceptible to falling out of fashion. Rolex should leverage its superior value retention—both in its resale value and in its “heirloom” quality—in order to better compete for luxury spending with brands outside its category.  
* Swiss luxury watch competitor Patek Philippe used print advertising to communicate the heirloom quality of its watches. Rolex could pursue a similar approach, perhaps using its more visible ambassadors, to communicate its own heirloom quality.
