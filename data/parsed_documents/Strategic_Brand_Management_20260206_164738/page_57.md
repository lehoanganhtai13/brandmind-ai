Lions Gate used social media to get consumers engaged, with tight targeting, planning, and execution. The campaign hinged on fan-based communication.  
The marketing campaign was an extension to the movie, rather than a marketing overlay. Games, chat room sessions, media downloads, podcasts, and other interactive links made consumers feel they were just reading up on a compelling movie. Even the casting announcement was done online.

## THE HUNGER GAMES

Lions Gate successfully deployed social media to merge the movie brand with its consumers’ individual identities. *The Hunger Games* is set in a place called Panem, comprising 12 districts, run by The Capitol. Following an uprising 70 years earlier, the Capitol organizes the Hunger Games, in which one boy and one girl chosen from each District (aged 12 to 18 years) battle to the death, until one child is left standing and is rewarded with food and supplies for a lifetime.  
Lions Gate built up interest in the plot using YouTube and Facebook. The trailer was released online and achieved 8 million views within 24 hours. During the launch week, Yahoo!Movies delivered over 8 million streams of the movie, with over 30 million page views. *The Hunger Games* achieved 3.6 million likes on Facebook, and 400,000 followers on Twitter.<sup>36</sup>

### Increased Competition

One reason marketers have been forced to use so many financial incentives or discounts is that the marketplace has become more competitive. Both demand-side and supply-side factors have contributed to the increase in competitive intensity. On the demand side, consumption for many products and services has flattened and hit the maturity stage, or even the decline stage, of the product life cycle. As a result, marketers can achieve sales growth for brands only by taking away competitors’ market share. On the supply side, new competitors have emerged due to a number of factors, such as the following:

* *Globalization:* Although firms have embraced globalization as a means to open new markets and potential sources of revenue, it has also increased the number of competitors in existing markets, threatening current sources of revenue.  
* *Low-priced competitors:* Market penetration by generics, private labels, and low-priced “clones” imitating product leaders has increased on a worldwide-basis. Retailers have gained power and often dictate what happens within the store. Their chief marketing weapon is price, and they have introduced and pushed their own brands and demanded greater compensation from trade promotions to stock and display national brands.  
* *Brand extensions:* We’ve noted that many companies have taken their existing brands and launched products with the same name into new categories. Many of these brands provide formidable opposition to market leaders.  
* *Deregulation:* Certain industries like telecommunications, financial services, health care, and transportation have become deregulated, leading to increased competition from outside traditionally defined product-market boundaries.

### Increased Costs

At the same time that competition is increasing, the cost of introducing a new product or supporting an existing product has increased rapidly, making it difficult to match the investment and level of support that brands were able to receive in previous years. In 2008, about 123,000 new consumer products were introduced in the United States, but with a failure rate estimated at over 90 percent. Given the millions of dollars spent on developing and marketing a new product, the total failure cost was conservatively estimated by one group to exceed billions of dollars.<sup>37</sup>

### Greater Accountability

Finally, marketers often find themselves responsible for meeting ambitious short-term profit targets because of financial market pressures and senior management imperatives. Stock analysts value strong and consistent earnings reports as an indication of the long-term financial health of a firm. As a result, marketing managers may find themselves in the dilemma of having to make decisions with short-term benefits but long-term costs (such as cutting advertising expenditures). Moreover, many of these same managers have experienced rapid job turnover and promotions Marketers clearly face a number of competitive challenges, and some critics feel the response of many has been ineffective or, worse, has further aggravated the problem.
