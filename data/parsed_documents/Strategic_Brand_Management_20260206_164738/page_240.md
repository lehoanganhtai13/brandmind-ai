Special-interest community sites such as GoFISHn, with over 150,000 loyal anglers, and Dogster, with over 600,000 dog lovers, present even more focused targets.^56

Some brands have fully embraced social media. Lego has always involved lead users and fans in its brand marketing activities, so it is no surprise it has thousands of YouTube videos and Flickr photos. Even top executives of some brands, such as Virgin’s Richard Branson and Zappos’s Tony Hsieh, weigh in with their comments. When companies choose to engage in social media, speed of response and the proper tone is critical.

There is no question that some consumers are choosing to become engaged with a brand at a deeper and broader level, and marketers must do everything they can to encourage them to do so. P&G invested heavily in 2010 to expand its Facebook presence with its brands. Fifteen of its brands quickly gained over 100,000 followers, and Pringles and Old Spice gained 9 million and 1.3 million, respectively. Its “Mean Girls Stink” antibullying Facebook app for Secret deodorant was downloaded more than 250,000 times.^57

As exciting as these kinds of prospects are, marketers must also bear in mind that not everyone actively participates in social media. Only *some of the consumers* want to get involved with only *some of the brands* and, even then, only *some of the time*. Understanding how to best market a brand given such diversity in consumer backgrounds and interests is crucially important and will separate digital marketing winners and losers in the years to come.

*Putting It All Together.* Interactive marketing communications work well together. Attention-getting online ads and videos can drive consumers to a brand’s Web sites, where they can learn and experience more about the brand. Company-managed bulletin boards and blogs may then help create more engagement. Interactive marketing communications reinforces other forms of marketing communications as well.

Many experts maintain that a successful digitally based campaign for a brand often skillfully blends three different forms of media: paid, owned, and earned media. *Paid media* is all the various forms of more traditional advertising media described above, including TV and print. *Owned media* are those media channels the brand controls to some extent—Web sites, e-mails, social media, etc. *Earned media* are when consumers themselves communicate about the brand via social media, word-of-mouth, etc. It should be recognized that the lines sometimes blur, and communications can perform more than one function. For example, YouTube costs marketers to maintain, is under their control, but is also importantly social.

The interplay between the three forms of media is crucial. As one critic noted, “Paid media jump starts owned; owned sustains earned; and earned drives costs down and effectiveness up.”^58 Procter & Gamble’s highly successful “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” starring ex-football player Isaiah Mustafa started with humorous tongue-in-cheek ads (paid media) that migrated online to YouTube, Facebook, and a brand microsite (owned media) before gaining heightened public attention via word-of-mouth, media reports, and social network interactions (earned media).

It is important to track all form of social media formally and informally. A number of firms have popped up to assist firms in this pursuit. For its Gatorade brand, PepsiCo actually created its own “Mission Control” where four full-time employees monitor social-media posts 24 hours a day. Any mention of Gatorade on Twitter, Facebook, or elsewhere is flagged, allowing the company to join conversations when needed and appropriate, such as when a Facebook poster incorrectly noted that Gatorade contains high-fructose corn syrup.^59

Marketers have become more thoughtful about how to measure social media and classify interactive marketing success. The fact is, no matter how many they are, Facebook fans and Twitter followers will not matter if they are not engaged with the brand. Popular viral videos—like Burger King’s “Subservient Chicken”—will mean little if they don’t help to drive sales in some way.^60

### Events and Experiences

As important as online marketing is to brand management, events and experiences play an equally important role. Brand building in the virtual world must be complemented with brand building in the real or physical world. Events and experiences range from an extravagant multi-million dollar sponsorship of a major international event to a simple local in-store product demonstration or sampling program. What all these different kinds of events and experiences share
