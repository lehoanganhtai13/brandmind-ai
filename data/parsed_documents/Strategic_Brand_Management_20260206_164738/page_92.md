# BMW

When BMW first made a strong competitive push into the U.S. market in the early 1980s, it positioned the brand as being the only automobile that offered both *luxury* and *performance*. At that time, U.S. luxury cars like Cadillac were seen by many as lacking performance, and U.S. performance cars like the Chevy Corvette were seen as lacking luxury. By relying on the design of its cars, its German heritage, and other aspects of a well-designed marketing program, BMW was able to simultaneously achieve (1) a point-of-difference on performance and a point-of-parity on luxury with respect to luxury cars and (2) a point-of-difference on luxury and a point-of-parity on performance with respect to performance cars. The clever slogan, “The Ultimate Driving Machine,” effectively captured the newly created umbrella category—luxury performance cars.

While a straddle positioning often is attractive as a means of reconciling potentially conflicting consumer goals and creating a “best-of-both-worlds” solution, it also carries an extra burden. If the points-of-parity and points-of-difference with respect to both categories are not credible, consumers may not view the brand as a legitimate player in *either* category. Many early PDAs that unsuccessfully tried to straddle categories ranging from pagers to laptop computers provide a vivid illustration of this risk.

## Updating Positioning over Time

The previous section described some positioning guidelines that are especially useful for launching a new brand. With an established brand, an important question is how often to update its positioning. As a general rule, positioning should be fundamentally changed very infrequently, and only when circumstances significantly reduce the effectiveness of existing POPs and PODs.

Positioning, however, will evolve over time to better reflect market opportunities or challenges. A point-of-difference or point-of-parity may be refined, added, or dropped as situations dictate. One common market opportunity that often arises is the need to deepen the meaning of the brand to permit further expansion—*laddering*. One common market challenge is how to respond to competitive actions that threaten an existing positioning—*reacting*. We consider the positioning implications of each in turn.

### Laddering.

Although identifying PODs to dominate competition on benefits that are important to consumers provides a sound way to build an initial position, once the target market attains a basic understanding of how the brand relates to alternatives in the same category, it may be necessary to deepen the meanings associated with the brand positioning. It is often useful to explore underlying consumer motivations in a product category to uncover the relevant associations. For example, Maslow’s hierarchy maintains that consumers have different priorities and levels of needs.<sup>54</sup> From lowest to highest priority, they are as follows:
