# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 3-2

## Putting Customers First

But according to authors Larry Selden and Geoffrey Colvin, a few companies, such as Dell, Best Buy, and Royal Bank of Canada, have been solid stocks for shareholders through the years because of their customer-centric approach.

According to these authors, **customer-centricity** means that all employees understand how their actions affect share price. Selden and Colvin maintain that customer-centric companies are a good bet for investors because they hold an advantage that can lead to a jump in share price. To determine whether a company is truly customer-focused, Selden and Colvin suggest asking the following five questions:

1. **Is the company looking for ways to take care of you?**  
   Only a few companies identify customer needs first, and then create ways to meet them. Too many companies try to make customers buy the products and services they already offer. Royal Bank of Canada is an example of a company that found a customer segment with unique needs and met those needs. Many of the bank’s customers were Canadians who spent winters in Florida or Arizona. Those customers, who tended to be affluent, wanted to borrow money in the United States for homes and get a U.S. credit rating that reflected their Canadian record. They also wanted to be served by employees who knew the United States as well as Canada. To serve those customers, the bank opened a branch in Florida through its U.S. subsidiary. The results were exceptional: customers signed up in droves, and the new branch was profitable in months rather than the typical years. Opening new branches aimed at specific customer segments represented a growth opportunity for the bank’s shareholders.

2. **Does the company know its customers well enough to differentiate between them?**  
   True differentiation means knowing who your various customer segments are, what each group wants, where the groups are shopping, and how to serve the customers individually. For example, Best Buy configures some stores to serve its “soccer-mom” customer segment and others to entice a segment of affluent entertainment lovers with stores that have home-theater demo rooms.

3. **Is someone accountable for customers?**  
   At most companies, various departments own pieces of customer segments, but no one owns any specific one. At companies with customer-centric approaches, however, things are different. At Best Buy, for example, one manager is accountable for the “soccer-mom” segment across multiple stores.

4. **Is the company managed for shareholder value?**  
   If a company is managed for shareholder value, employees know about earning a return on invested capital that exceeds the cost of capital, plus investing increasing amounts of capital at that positive spread and maintaining that spread for as long as possible. Customer-centric companies apply those criteria to customer segments. They know how much capital they’ve invested in a segment and how much return they earn on it. They maintain the positive spread by creating and reinventing enduring customer relationships.

5. **Is the company testing new customer offers and learning from the results?**  
   Constant learning about what customers want and a formal process for sharing it are critical to customer-centricity. 7-Eleven Japan has done this well. Every week, employees from all over Japan would meet to discuss hypotheses tested and verified in the stores. Ideas such as changing the lunch menu for the next day based on the predicted weather (like serving hot noodles on a cool day) were heard throughout the company.
