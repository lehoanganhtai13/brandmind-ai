# TREMOR

Procter & Gamble’s proprietary word-of-mouth technology, Tremor, consists of 500,000 women who are part of their Vocalpoint panel and qualify as “connectors.” According to P&G, a connector is a person with a social network five to six times larger than the average person’s, and with a deep propensity to talk about ideas with that network. To identify a connector, a questionnaire weeds out 90 percent of potential respondents. Connectors, who are not paid, are attracted to the idea of hearing things first and being able to communicate directly back to the company. P&G has used Tremor for its own products, such as Noxzema and Pringles, and leased it to other companies, including WD-40, Kashi, and Kellogg. For its own Secret deodorant, it created a disruptive message, “The More You Move, the Better You Smell,” to counteract the perception that activity equates with sweat and a worse smell. The message was a well-designed complement to the advertising message, “Live Life. Don’t Sweat It,” and 51,000 posts were made to its Web site as a result. Steve Knox, former CEO of the P&G unit, claims the real key to success is creating messaging that creates word-of-mouth. “The way we phrase this to people is there’s a message that the consumer wants to hear and then there’s a message they want to share with their friends and those are two different messages.” He claims the biggest mistake made with word-of-mouth is to say, “Here’s my marketing message. Make them talk about this.” Based in part on the success of Tremor, General Mills and Kraft launched their own word-of-mouth marketing programs in 2008.81

Buzz marketing works well when the marketing message appears to originate with an independent source and not with the brand. Because consumers are becoming increasingly skeptical and wary of traditional advertising, buzz marketers seek to expose consumers to their brands in a unique and innocuous fashion.82 One approach is to enlist genuine consumers able to give authentic-seeming endorsements of the brand. An ad executive with Bates USA explained the goal of this strategy: “Ultimately, the brand benefits because an accepted member of the social circle will always be more credible than any communication that could ever come directly from the brand.”83

Some criticize buzz marketing as “a form of cultural corruption” in which marketers are actually creating the culture at a fundamental level. Critics claim that buzz marketing’s interference in consumers’ lives is insidious because participants cannot always detect the pitch. Another potential problem with buzz marketing is that it requires a buzz-worthy product. As one marketing expert said, “The bad news is that [buzz marketing] only works in high-interest product categories.”

# DEVELOPING INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS

We’ve examined in depth the various communication options available to marketers. Now we consider how to develop an integrated marketing communication (IMC) program by choosing the best set options and managing the relationships between them.84 Our main theme is that marketers should “mix and match” communication options to build brand equity—that is,

Kellogg’s “Share Your Breakfast” campaign—shown here at a press event with actress Melissa Joan Hart at New York’s Grand Central Terminal—was backed by a fully integrated marketing communications program.
