shampoos and conditioners, deodorants, and cosmetics and other beauty products, its key “gentleness” point-of-difference transferred relatively easily. With line extensions, on the other hand, marketers have to create a new association that can serve as an additional point-of-difference and help distinguish the extension from the parent brand too.

For line extensions, consumers must also understand how the new product relates to existing products in order to minimize possible cannibalization or confusion. For example, when Anheuser-Busch first launched Bud Select, the low-carb beer with no aftertaste was positioned as an “upscale, white-collar brew.” The emphasis on no aftertaste, however, drew an implicit comparison that cast other Anheuser-Busch products in a dim light and caused some consumers to abandon their usual Bud or Bud Light in favor of the new brand. As a result, nearly all of Bud Select’s 1.3 percent share of supermarket sales earned in the month after its launch came at the expense of other Anheuser-Busch beers, which lost a share point during the same period.<sup>56</sup>

### Leveraging Secondary Brand Associations.

Brand extensions will often leverage the same secondary associations as the parent brand, although competing in the extension category may require some additional fortification like linking to other entities. A brand extension differs in that, by definition, there is always some leveraging of another brand or company. The extent to which these other associations become linked to the extension, however, depends on the branding strategy the firm adopts and how it brands the extension. As we’ve seen, the more common the brand elements and the more prominence they receive, the more likely it is that parent brand associations will transfer.

### Evaluate Extension Success and Effects on Parent Brand Equity

The final step in evaluating brand extension opportunities is to assess the extent to which an extension is able to achieve its own equity as well as contribute to the equity of the parent brand. To help measure its success, we can use brand tracking based on the customer-based brand equity model or other key measures of consumer response, centered on both the extension and the parent brand as a whole. Brand Focus 12.0 contains a simple checklist and describes a more detailed scorecard to help in evaluating brand extension opportunities.
