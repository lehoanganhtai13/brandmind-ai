This data presents a comparative analysis of product usage across different stages, illustrating a decline in user engagement as usage frequency increases. The categories range from "Aware" to "Most Often Use," with corresponding percentages indicating the proportion of users at each stage. A significant majority, 72%, are "Aware" of the product, while 46% have "Ever Tried" it. The percentage of users decreases substantially for "Recent Trial" (58%), "Occasional Use" (50%), and "Regular Use" (56%). The smallest user group, 5%, falls into the "Most Often Use" category, highlighting a steep drop-off in consistent engagement. This structure reveals a funnel-like progression where initial awareness and trial lead to progressively smaller segments of dedicated, frequent users.

Hypothetical Examples of Funnel Stages and Transitions

### Criteria.

A number of criteria have been offered to guide segmentation and target market decisions, such as the following:  
* Identifiability: Can we easily identify the segment?  
* Size: Is there adequate sales potential in the segment?  
* Accessibility: Are specialized distribution outlets and communication media available to reach the segment?  
* Responsiveness: How favorably will the segment respond to a tailored marketing program?

The obvious overriding consideration in defining market segments is profitability. In many cases, profitability can be related to behavioral considerations. Developing a segmentation scheme with direct customer lifetime value perspectives can be highly advantageous. To improve the long-term profitability of their customer base, drugstore chain CVS considered the role of beauty products for its customers at three distinct stages of life, producing the following hypothetical profiles or personas:

* **Caroline**, a single 20-something, is relatively new to her career and still has an active social life. She is an extremely important beauty customer who visits the chain once a week. Her favorite part of shopping is getting new beauty products, and she looks to CVS to help her cultivate her look at a price she can afford.  
* Caroline will grow into **Vanessa**, the soccer mom with three children; she may not be as consumed with fashion as she once was, but preserving her youthful appearance is definitely still a major priority. She squeezes in trips to the store en route to or from work or school, and convenient features such as drive-through pharmacies are paramount for Vanessa.  
* Vanessa becomes **Sophie**. Sophie isn’t much of a beauty customer, but she is CVS’s most profitable demographic—a regular pharmacy customer who actively shops the front of the store for key OTC items.

### Nature of Competition

At least implicitly, deciding to target a certain type of consumer often defines the nature of competition, because other firms have also decided to target that segment in the past or plan to do so in the future, or because consumers in that segment already may look to other brands in their purchase decisions. Competition takes place on other bases, of course, such as channels of distribution. Competitive analysis considers a whole host of factors—including the resources, capabilities, and likely intentions of various other firms—in order for marketers to choose markets where consumers can be profitably served.
