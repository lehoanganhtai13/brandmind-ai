# BRANDING BRIEF 4-3

## Do-Overs with Brand Makeovers

With more markets characterized by intense competition, rapidly changing products, and increasingly fickle customers, many marketers are looking at makeovers to breathe new life into their brands. Logos, symbols, packaging, and even brand names are being updated to create greater meaning, relevance, differentiation. Unfortunately, in an increasingly networked world, consumer reaction to changes to any brand element—both pro and con—can be quickly spread. Here are some high-profile examples and the challenges and difficulties their brand makeovers encountered.

**Tropicana.** In February 2009, Pepsi introduced a dramatic overhaul to its category-leading orange juice. Gone was the visual image of an orange with a straw protruding from it (designed to evoke freshness); in its place was a close-up image of a glass of orange juice and the phrase “100% Orange.” Consumer reaction was swift and largely negative. Customers complained about being unable to differentiate between the company’s pulp-free, traditional, and other juice varieties. Even worse, customers also felt the look was too generic. Facing online fury and with the words “ugly,” “stupid,” and “bargain brand” ringing in their ears, Pepsi capitulated. Announcing that it had “underestimated the deep emotional bond” consumers had with the original packaging, the company reverted to the old versions after only six weeks.

**The Gap.** Another brand walking into a digital brand-makeover firestorm, The Gap actually asked for it. After unexpectedly unveiling a new logo (the word *Gap* in a basic black Helvetica font with a small blue square over the upper-right hand portion of the p), the company asked consumers on its Facebook page for comments and further logo ideas. Feedback was far from kind, and after enduring a long week of criticism, Gap management announced that “We’ve heard loud and clear that you don’t like the new logo” and reverted to its iconic white text logo and unique brand font.

**Gatorade & Pepsi.** Around the same time as the Tropicana makeover, Pepsi also completely overhauled its Gatorade brand as well as its classic Pepsi-cola product lineup. Gatorade’s makeover included introducing a whole new system of thirst quenchers and fluid restoration for before (Prime 01), during (Perform 02), and after (Recover 03) exercise. The new brand goal was to reach athletes in a wide range of sports and experience levels while positioning itself as the one-stop source for hydration and other needs before, during, and after their workouts. Pepsi’s makeover included a new logo—a white band in the middle of the Pepsi circle that appeared to loosely form a smile. Both brand makeovers received some negative feedback and the products experienced sluggish sales afterwards, although several factors may have contributed, including the severe recession.

**Lessons.** When changing a well-received or even iconic brand element—a character, logo, or packaging—two issues are key. One, the new brand element must be inherently highly regarded. Part of the problems some brands have run into is that their new logos or packaging are just not that appealing to consumers, leading the consumer to wonder why a change needed to be made. Two, regardless of the inherent appeal of a new brand element, changes are hard for consumers and should be handled carefully and patiently.

No wonder Starbucks went to great pains in 2010 to carefully explain the rationale of its logo makeover, its fourth since the brand was created in 1971. The change was prompted by the company’s fortieth anniversary and the new directions it was considering, which would take the brand outside the coffee category. Founder Howard Schultz explained that the iconic green Siren in the center of the logo was made more prominent—by dropping the words “Starbucks Coffee”—to reflect new business lines and new international markets. Like many brand makeovers, it initially met mixed public reaction.

Some strong brands have a number of valuable brand elements that directly reinforce each other. For example, consider Charmin toilet tissue. Phonetically, the name itself conveys softness. The brand character, Mr. Whipple, and the brand slogan, “Please Don’t Squeeze the Charmin,” also help reinforce the key point-of-difference for the brand of “softness.”

Brand names characterized by rich, concrete visual imagery often can yield powerful logos or symbols. Wells Fargo, a large California-based bank, has a brand name rich in Western heritage that can be exploited throughout its marketing program. Wells Fargo has adopted Cornell University’s Brian Wansink has conducted a series of research studies into the consumer psychology of packaging.
