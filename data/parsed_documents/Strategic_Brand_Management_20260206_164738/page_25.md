# REVISION STRATEGY FOR FOURTH EDITION

The overarching goal of the revision of *Strategic Brand Management* was to preserve the aspects of the text that worked well, but to improve it as much as possible by updating and adding new material as needed. We deliberately avoided change for change’s sake. Our driving concern was to create the best possible textbook for readers willing to invest their time and energy at mastering the subject of branding.

We retained the customer-based brand equity framework that was the centerpiece of the third edition, and the three dimensions of depth, breadth, and relevance. Given all the academic research progress that has been made in recent years, however, as well as all the new market developments and events, the book required—and got—some important updates.

1. *New and updated Branding Briefs and in-text examples:* Many new Branding Briefs and numerous in-text examples have been added. The goal was to blend classic and contemporary examples, so many still-relevant and illuminating examples remain.  
2. *Additional academic references:* As noted, the branding area continues to receive concerted academic research attention. Accordingly, each chapter incorporates new references and sources for additional study.  
3. *Tighter chapters:* Chapters have been trimmed and large boxed material carefully screened to provide a snappier, more concise read.  
4. *Stronger visuals:* The text includes numerous engaging photos and graphics. These visuals highlight many of the important and interesting concepts and examples from the chapters.  
5. *Updated and new original cases:* To provide broader, more relevant coverage, new cases have been added to the *Best Practices in Branding* casebook including PRODUCT (RED), King Arthur Flour, and Target. Each of the remaining cases has been significantly updated. All of the cases are considerably shorter and tighter. Collectively, these cases provide insights into the thinking and activities of some of the world’s best marketers while also highlighting the many challenges they still face.

In terms of content, the book continues to incorporate material to address the changing technological, cultural, global, and economic environment that brands face. Some of the specific new topics reviewed in depth in the fourth edition include:
