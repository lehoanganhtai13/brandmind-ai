For example, if you ask the average consumer what comes to mind when he or she thinks of Heineken beer, a common response is a “green bottle.” The package can become an important means of brand recognition and convey or imply information to build or reinforce valuable brand associations. Molson’s beer sales increased by 40 percent in the United States after the company modified the bottle’s back labels to include cheeky “ice-breakers” for bar patrons such as “On the Rebound,” “Sure, You Can Have My Number,” and “Fairly Intimidated by Your Beauty.” Buoyed by that success, they later introduced “Answer Honestly” bottle back labels that gave drinkers challenging choices to mull over.⁶¹

Structural packaging innovations can create a point-of-difference that permits a higher margin. New packages can also expand a market and capture new market segments. Packaging changes can have immediate impact on customer shopping behavior and sales: a redesign of Häagen-Dazs packaging increased flavor shoppability by 21 percent; General Mills saw an increase in sales of 80 percent after redesigning Bisquick Shake n’ Pour package to improve its ergonomics and by creating a “smooth, curvy form that reinforces the brand equity”; and a redesign on the packaging for Jimmy Dean’s Biscuit Sandwiches lead to an increase of 13 percent in household penetration.⁶²

One of the major packaging trends of recent years is to make both bigger and smaller packaged versions of products (as well as portions) to appeal to new market segments.⁶³ Jumbo sizes have been successfully introduced for hot dogs, pizzas, English muffins, frozen dinners, and beer. Pillsbury’s Grands! biscuits—40 percent larger than existing offerings—were the most successful new product in the company’s 126-year history when introduced. But sometimes smaller has proven to be successful too.

### 100-CALORIE PACKS

By 2007, a few years after their introduction by Kraft, 100-calorie snack packs of crackers, chips, cookies, and candy had passed the $200-million mark. Truly a consumer-driven packaging innovation, they had an appeal that was plain and simple—portion control made easy. The products were identical to those in larger packages but conveniently placed in handy 100-calorie packs for which calorie-conscious consumers were willing to pay a premium. With sales of the packs growing at almost 30 percent a year by 2007, most top food manufacturers—including Kraft’s Nabisco, Hershey, PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, and Campbell’s Pepperidge Farm—introduced their own versions. In the years that followed, however, the 100-calorie snack pack market began to slow down. A number of factors contributed to the cooling off, such as market saturation (190 products were introduced in 2008 and at least 68 in 2009) and customer concerns about their actual effectiveness in controlling caloric intake, their relatively high price, and the amount of wasteful packaging.⁶⁴

Though they were a very successful packaging innovation, 100-calorie snack packs did find it hard to sustain their sales growth over time.
