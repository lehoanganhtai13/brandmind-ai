only 23 of the top brands in the 100 categories remained market leaders in 1997, and 28 percent of the leading brands had failed by 1997. The clothing and fashion category experienced the greatest percentage of failures (67 percent) and had no brands that remained leaders in 1997. Leaders in the food and beverage category fared better, with 39 percent of brands maintaining leadership while only 21 percent failed.

One 1923 leader that did not maintain leadership was Underwood typewriters. Underwood’s primary mistake was lack of innovation. Rather than invest in research and development, Underwood followed a harvesting strategy that sought the highest margin possible for its products. By 1950, several competitors had already invested in computer technology, whereas Underwood acquired a small computer firm only in 1952. Subsequent developments in the market further damaged Underwood’s position. Between 1956 and 1961, lower-priced foreign competitors more than doubled their share of manual typewriter sales. Sales of electric typewriters, which Underwood did not make, overtook sales of manual typewriters in the early 1960s. Olivetti acquired Underwood in the mid-1960s, and the brand name was dropped in the 1980s.

By failing to innovate beyond manual typewriters, Underwood was left behind when consumers moved on to electric typewriters.

Golder uses Wrigley, which has dominated the chewing gum market for nine decades, as an example of a long-term leader. According to Golder, Wrigley’s success is based on three factors: “maintaining and building strong brands, focusing on a single product, and being in a category that has not changed much.” Wrigley has consistently marketed its brand with high-profile sponsorship and advertising. It also used subsidiaries to extend into new product categories like sugarless gum and bubblegum, so as not to dilute the brand. Wrigley’s sole focus on chewing gum enables the company to achieve maximum results in what is considered a mature category. During the 1990s, sales of Wrigley’s products grew almost 10 percent annually. Finally, the chewing gum market is historically stable and uncomplicated. Still, Wrigley’s makes considerable investments in product and packaging improvement to maintain its edge.

Golder and his co-author Gerard Tellis argue that dedication to the brand is vital for sustained brand leadership, elucidating five factors for enduring market leadership (see Figure 1-7). They comment:

> The real causes of enduring market leadership are vision and will. Enduring market leaders have a revolutionary and inspiring vision of the mass market, and they exhibit an indomitable will to realize that vision. They persist under adversity, innovate relentlessly, commit financial resources and leverage assets to realize their vision.

Follow-up research by Golder and his colleagues of brand leaders in 126 categories over a span from 1921 to 2005 found the following:

* Leading brands are more likely to persist during economic slowdowns and when inflation is high, and less likely to persist during economic expansion and when inflation is low.
* Half the leading brands in the sample lost their leadership over periods ranging from 12 to 39 years.
* The rate of brand leadership persistence has been substantially lower in recent eras than in earlier eras.
* Once brand leadership is lost, it is rarely regained.
* Category types with above-average rates of brand leadership persistence are food and household supplies; category types with below-average rates of brand leadership persistence are durables and clothing.
