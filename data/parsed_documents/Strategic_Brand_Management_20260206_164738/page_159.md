**Cautions.** There are some cautions and drawbacks to using brand characters. Brand characters can be so attention getting and well liked that they dominate other brand elements and actually *dampen* brand awareness.

### EVEREADY

When Ralston Purina introduced its drumming pink bunny that “kept going . . . and going . . . and going” in ads for the Eveready Energizer battery, many consumers were so captivated by the character that they paid little attention to the name of the advertised brand. As a result, they often mistakenly believed that the ad was for Eveready’s chief competitor, Duracell. Eveready had to add the pink bunny to its packages, promotions, and other marketing communications to create stronger brand links. Through its concerted marketing efforts through the years, however, the Energizer Bunny has now achieved iconic status. Many marketing experts view the character as the “ultimate product demo” because of how effectively it showcases the product’s unique selling proposition—long-lived batteries—in an inventive, fresh way. As the company’s CEO noted, “The message of the Energizer Bunny has remained consistent over the last two decades; he speaks to longevity, determination and perseverance.” The bunny celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009, having achieved several milestones, including 95 percent awareness among consumers and an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. Perhaps the greatest compliment, however, is how often everyone from politicians to sport stars have used the Energizer Bunny to describe their own staying power.[^50]

Characters often must be updated over time so that their image and personality remain relevant to the target market. Japan’s famous Hello Kitty character, which became a multibillion dollar product and license powerhouse, found its sales shrinking over the last decade, a victim in part of overexposure and a failure to make the character modern and appealing across multiple media.[^51]

In general, the more realistic the brand character, the more important it is to keep it up-to-date. One advantage of fictitious or animated characters is that their appeal can be more enduring and timeless than that of real people. Branding Brief 4-1 describes the efforts by General Mills to evolve the Betty Crocker character over time. Finally, some characters are so culturally specific that they do not travel well to other countries. The Science of Branding 4-2 describes some guidelines from a leading consultant.

### Slogans

*Slogans* are short phrases that communicate descriptive or persuasive information about the brand. They often appear in advertising but can play an important role on packaging and in other aspects of the marketing program. When Snickers advertised, “Hungry? Grab a Snickers,” the slogan also appeared on the candy bar wrapper itself.

Slogans are powerful branding devices because, like brand names, they are an extremely efficient, shorthand means to build brand equity. They can function as useful “hooks” or “handles” to help consumers grasp the meaning of a brand—what it is and what makes it special.[^52] They are an indispensable means of summarizing and translating the intent of a marketing program in a few short words or phrases. For example, State Farm Insurance’s “Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm Is There” has been used for decades to represent the brand’s dependability and aura of friendship.

**Benefits.** Some slogans help build brand awareness by playing off the brand name in some way, as in “The Citi Never Sleeps.” Others build brand awareness even more explicitly by making strong links between the brand and the corresponding product category, like when Lifetime would advertise that it was “Television for Women.” Most important, slogans can help reinforce the brand positioning as in “Staples. That Was Easy.” For HBO, a slogan was critical to conveying its unique positioning.
