The main ones are brand names, URLs, logos, symbols, characters, spokespeople, slogans, jingles, packages, and signage. The customer-based brand equity model suggests that marketers should choose brand elements to enhance brand awareness; facilitate the formation of strong, favorable, and unique brand associations; or elicit positive brand judgments and feelings. The test of the brand-building ability of a brand element is what consumers would think or feel about the product *if they knew only that particular brand element* and not anything else about the product and how else it would be branded or marketed. A brand element that provides a positive contribution to brand equity conveys or implies certain valued associations or responses.

This chapter considers how marketers choose brand elements to build brand equity. After describing the general criteria for choosing brand elements, we consider specific tactical issues for each of the different types of brand elements and finish by discussing how to choose the best brand elements to build brand equity. Brand Focus 4.0 at the end of the chapter highlights some legal issues for branding.

## CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING BRAND ELEMENTS

In general, there are six criteria for brand elements (with more specific subchoices for each, as shown in Figure 4-1):

1. Memorable  
2. Meaningful  
3. Likable  
4. Transferable  
5. Adaptable  
6. Protectable  

This table outlines six key attributes of strong branding, presented as distinct but interconnected qualities. The attributes are: Memorable, Meaningful, Likable, Transferable, Adaptable, and Protectable. Each attribute is further elaborated with specific characteristics. Memorable branding is defined by being easily recognized and recalled. Meaningful branding is characterized by being descriptive and persuasive. Likable branding encompasses being fun and interesting, possessing rich visual and verbal imagery, and being aesthetically pleasing. Transferable branding allows for application within and across product categories, as well as across geographic boundaries and cultures. Adaptable branding is flexible and updatable. Finally, Protectable branding ensures legal and competitive safeguarding. The structure suggests a framework for evaluating and developing effective brand elements, with each attribute contributing to the overall strength and longevity of a brand.
