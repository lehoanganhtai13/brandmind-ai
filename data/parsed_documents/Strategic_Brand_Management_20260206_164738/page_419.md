## Corporate Name Changes

### Rationale

A merger or acquisition is often the impetus to reevaluate naming strategies and weigh the existing and potential equity of each brand in its new context.[53]

* A new corporate name arising from a merger or acquisition may be based on some combination of two existing names, if they are strong. For example, when Glaxo Wellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham, the new company became GlaxoSmithKline. J.P. Morgan & Co. and Chase Manhattan Corporation became JP Morgan Chase after their merger. United’s name was combined with Continental’s globe logo when those two air carriers merged.
* If there is an imbalance in brand equity, the firm typically chooses the name with more inherent brand equity and relegates the other to a sub-brand role or eliminates it altogether. When Citicorp merged with Travelers, the latter’s name was dropped, although its familiar red umbrella symbol was retained as part of the new Citigroup brand look.
* Finally, if neither name has the desired brand equity, a completely new name can signal new capabilities. When Bell Atlantic purchased GTE in 2000, the newly merged company adopted the Verizon brand name, which combined *veritas*, the Latin word for reliability, and *horizon*, which was intended to signify a forward-looking attitude.

Corporate names also change because of divestitures, leveraged buyouts, or the sale of assets. When Andersen Consulting was allowed to separate from Arthur Andersen following an arbitrator’s ruling in 2000, it was required to stop using its old name by the end of the year. After an extensive naming search and rebranding project, the firm was renamed “Accenture”—an employee suggestion meant to connote an “accent on the future.” Having a new name proved especially fortuitous when Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2002 in the wake of the Enron scandal and ceased to operate as a business. Some residual negative perceptions from Arthur Andersen would likely have transferred to the Andersen Consulting brand.

Corporate names can also change to correct public misperceptions about the nature of the company’s business.[54] For example, Europe’s third-largest food company, BSN, renamed itself for its Danone brand—a hugely successful fresh dairy products subsidiary, second only to Coca-Cola in terms of branded sales in Europe—because many consumers didn’t know what the old name stood for. Moreover, BSN was already used by other companies in other countries, including a bank in Spain, a textile firm in the United States, and a television station in Japan.[55]

Significant shifts in corporate strategy may necessitate name changes. US Steel changed its name to USX to downplay the importance of steel and metal in its product mix. Allegheny Airlines changed its name to USAir when it moved from being a regional to a national carrier, and then later to USAirways when it wanted to be seen as an international carrier. Its later acquisition of America West did not require a change in strategy or implementation but brought significant logistical hurdles.

Sometimes a name change just reflects the fact that the original name wasn’t all that good and probably shouldn’t have been chosen to begin with.

### BOLOCO

A small New England restaurant chain selling burritos, bowls, and smoothies was called The Wrap, derived from its original name, Under Wraps. In 2005, the founders felt a name change was in order because the word “wrap” had come to mean something that was typically cold, full of lettuce, and wrapped in pita bread and then cellophane, with a packet of mayonnaise and mustard on the side. The Wrap, on the other hand, had always been about hot, grilled, fresh ingredients wrapped in steamed tortillas, more like a burrito than a wrap. The new name, Boloco, and the tag line “Inspired Burritos” were much more evocative of what the chain sold. As cofounder and CEO John S. Pepper explained, 

> “The name has a bit of a Latin flair with ‘loco,’ reflecting what our menu focuses on—inspired burritos. Furthermore, Boloco—Boston Local Company—is a tribute to the city of Boston and our customers who gave us a chance to be successful.” Another reason for the name change was that The Wrap was too generic to be protected legally.
