TOMS Shoes used cause marketing to launch its brand.

## TOMS SHOES

When entrepreneur and former reality-show contestant Blake Mycoskie visited Argentina in 2006, he saw masses of children who suffered health risks and interrupted schooling due to a simple lack of shoes. Once home, Mycoskie started TOMS Shoes, whose name conveys “Shoes for a Better Tomorrow” and whose One for One program delivers a free pair of shoes to a needy child for each pair sold. The shoes themselves are based on the classic *alpargata* style found in Argentina. They’re sold online and through top retailers such as Whole Foods, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. TOMS’s donated shoes—black, unisex canvas slip-ons with a sturdy sole—can now be found on the feet of more than 2 million kids in developing countries such as Argentina and Ethiopia. TOMS has a strong social media presence with almost a million Facebook friends. In 2011, Mycoskie launched TOMS Eyewear, using a similar One for One model in which for every pair of glasses sold, a child in need will receive either medical care, prescription glasses, or sight-saving surgery.<sup>44</sup>

Brand Focus 11.0 outlines the advantages of cause marketing, the obstacles they face, and how to successfully design a successful campaign, with particular emphasis on green marketing.

### Corporate Image Campaigns.

*Corporate image campaigns* are designed to create associations to the corporate brand as a whole; consequently, they tend to ignore or downplay individual products or sub-brands.<sup>45</sup> As we would expect, some of the biggest spenders on these kinds of campaigns are well-known firms that use their company or corporate name prominently in their branding strategies, such as GE, Toyota, British Telecom, IBM, Novartis, and Deutsche Bank.

Corporate image campaigns have been criticized as an ego-stroking waste of time, and they can be easy for consumers to ignore. However, a strong campaign can provide invaluable marketing and financial benefits by allowing the firm to express itself and embellish the meaning of its corporate brand and associations for its individual products, as Philips did.
