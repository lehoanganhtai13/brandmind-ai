The Infosys “think flat” campaign proposed that Infosys could enable clients to shift from:  
* Managing information to making money from it;  
* Achieving customer satisfaction to creating customer loyalty;  
* Withstanding turbulence to getting ahead during industry cycles; and  
* Growing passively to driving growth by becoming global producers.  

Infosys’s sales rose from $2 billion to $3 billion in just 12 months. Infosys became the first Indian company to be added to a major global index when it joined the NASDAQ-100 in December 2006.  
Infosys announced its March 2013 revenue forecast at approximately $7.5 billion. It continues to evolve the brand to appeal to more businesses as a reliable and effective partner.  

**High-tech Products.** Many technology companies have struggled with branding. Managed by technologists, these firms often lack any kind of brand strategy and sometimes see branding as simply naming their products. In many of their markets, however, financial success is no longer driven by product innovation alone, or by the latest and greatest product specifications and features. Marketing skills are playing an increasingly important role in the adoption and success of high-tech products.  

### CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY  
Famous for its Sound Blaster series of PC soundcards that became the gold standard for Windows-based multimedia PCs in the 1990s, Creative Technology and its subsidiary ZiiLABS announced the launch of the Creative HanZpad tablet computer in February 2012.  

What sets Creative apart from other tablet manufacturers is that the HanZpad has Chinese language content developed specifically for it, including textbooks for mathematics, science, and other subjects. Sim Wong Hoo, CEO of Creative Technology believes that it is this that will give them the competitive advantage over competitors such as Apple that do not have Chinese content.  

For a start, Creative is targeting China’s vast education market. Instead of going it alone, it has formed the HanZpad Alliance, a collaborative network of more than 20 Chinese and Taiwanese companies that manufacture, market, and distribute the new product. This alliance allows Creative to tap into its partners’ local knowledge and competencies to provide fully integrated solutions and supply chain management for the design, development, and marketing of tablet computers based on the HanZpad platform. To create awareness and establish its presence in the education segment, Creative is also working with a number of Chinese schools in a Creative-led e-learning pilot project with HanZpad tablets. CEO Sim’s dream is that every single Chinese student will be able to use a HanZpad for his or her education.  

Creative Technologies aims to tap into the Chinese market by creating Chinese language content for their tablet - HanZpad.
