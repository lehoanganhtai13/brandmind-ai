From a consumer behavior perspective, branded ingredients are often a signal of quality. In a provocative academic research study, Carpenter, Glazer, and Nakamoto found that the inclusion of a branded attribute (“Alpine Class” fill for a down jacket) significantly affected consumer choices even when consumers were explicitly told that the attribute was not relevant to their decision.<sup>27</sup> Clearly, consumers inferred certain quality characteristics as a result of the branded ingredient.

The uniformity and predictability of ingredient brands can reduce risk and reassure consumers. As a result, ingredient brands can become industry standards and consumers will not want to buy a product that does not contain the ingredient. In other words, ingredient brands can become, in effect, a category point-of-parity. Consumers do not necessarily have to know exactly how the ingredient works—just that it adds value.

Ingredient branding has become more prevalent as mature brands seek cost-effective means to differentiate themselves on the one hand, and potential ingredient products seek means to expand their sales opportunities on the other hand. Some companies create their own ingredient brands, such as Chevron with its Techron gasoline additive, Westin with its Heavenly Bed, and Best Buy with its Geek Squad technical support team.<sup>28</sup> To illustrate the range of alternatives in ingredient branding, consider how Singapore Airlines uses both co-branded and self-branded ingredients in their service delivery.

### SINGAPORE AIRLINES

In its Suites class of service, Singapore Airlines offers bedding and tableware from Givenchy as well as new chairs hand stitched by “master Italian craftsman” Poltrona Frau. The First Class SkySuites feature leather seats trimmed with Burrwood. The airline offers the Krisworld entertainment system and Givenchy fleece blankets. In the more expensive Suites, first, and business classes, customers can enjoy Bose QuietComfort 2 acoustic noise-canceling headphones (economy flyers get Dolby). For its cuisine, Singapore Airlines’s meals are prepared by its International Culinary Panel and premium classes enjoy ethnically branded meals such as Shahi Thali (Suites and first class) and Hanakoireki (business class). All passengers can join the KrisFlyer frequent flyer program.<sup>29</sup>

Thus, as in this example, one product may contain a number of different branded ingredients. Ingredient brands are not restricted to products and services. For example, through the years, electronics specialty retailer RadioShack has established strategic alliances with Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, RCA, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, and others that let the manufacturers set up kiosks within many of RadioShack’s 7,000 U.S. stores. RadioShack itself has set up mobile phone kiosks in almost 1,500 Target stores in the United States, served by Radio Shack’s own black-shirted employees and using its own point-of-sale systems.<sup>30</sup> The pros and cons of ingredient branding are similar to those of co-branding.
