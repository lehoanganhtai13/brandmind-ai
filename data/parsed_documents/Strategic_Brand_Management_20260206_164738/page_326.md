Ideally, marketers would be able to construct detailed “mental maps” to understand exactly what exists in consumers’ minds—all their thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, beliefs, and attitudes toward different brands. These mental blueprints would then provide managers with the insights to develop a solid brand positioning with the right points-of-parity and points-of-difference and the strategic guidance to help them make good brand decisions. Unfortunately, such brand knowledge structures are not easily measured because they reside only in consumers’ minds.

Nevertheless, effective brand management requires us to thoroughly understand the consumer. Often a simple insight into how consumers think of or use products and the particular brands in a category can help create a profitable change in the marketing program. That’s why many large companies conduct exhaustive research studies (or brand audits, as described in Chapter 8) to learn as much as possible about consumers.

A number of detailed, sophisticated research techniques and methods now exist to help marketers better understand consumer knowledge structures. A host of primary and secondary data sources exist online. Many industry or company studies can be accessed and surveys can be efficiently distributed and collected. This chapter highlights some of the important considerations critical to the measurement of brand equity.<sup>1</sup> Figure 9-1 outlines general considerations in understanding consumer behavior, and Branding Brief 9-1 describes the lengths to which marketers have gone in the past to learn about consumers.

According to the brand value chain, sources of brand equity arise from the customer mindset. In general, measuring sources of brand equity requires that the brand manager fully understand how customers shop for and use products and services and, most important, what customers know, think, and feel about and act toward various brands. In particular, measuring sources of customer-based brand equity requires us to measure various aspects of brand awareness and brand image that can lead to the differential customer response making up brand equity.

Consumers may have a holistic view of brands that is difficult to divide into component parts. But many times we can, in fact, isolate perceptions and assess them in greater detail. The remainder of this chapter describes qualitative and quantitative approaches to identifying potential sources of brand equity—that is, capturing the customer mind-set.

## QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

There are many different ways to uncover the types of associations linked to the brand and their corresponding strength, favorability, and uniqueness. *Qualitative research techniques* often identify possible brand associations and sources of brand equity. These are relatively unstructured measurement approaches that permit a range of both questions and answers and so can often be a useful first step in exploring consumer brand and product perceptions.

> Who buys our product or service?  
> Who makes the decision to buy the product?  
> Who influences the decision to buy the product?  
> How is the purchase decision made? Who assumes what role?  
> What does the customer buy? What needs must be satisfied?  
> Why do customers buy a particular brand?  
> Where do they go or look to buy the product or service?  
> When do they buy? Any seasonality factors?  
> What are customers’ attitudes toward our product?  
> What social factors might influence the purchase decision?  
> Does the customers’ lifestyle influence their decisions?  
> How is our product perceived by customers?  
> How do demographic factors influence the purchase decision?  

This figure outlines a model for understanding consumer behavior, presented as a cyclical process. It begins with the identification of **Needs**, which triggers **Motives**. These motives then influence the consumer's **Perception** of available **Information**. This information is processed, leading to **Learning** and the formation of **Attitudes**. Attitudes, in turn, guide the consumer's **Decision Process**, which culminates in **Purchase Behavior**. Following the purchase, the consumer engages in **Post-purchase Evaluation**, which feeds back into their future needs and perceptions, thus completing the cycle and influencing subsequent behaviors. The model emphasizes the interconnectedness of these stages in shaping how consumers make choices. Because the consumer behavior we observe can differ from the behavior consumers report in surveys, useful marketing insights sometimes emerge from unobtrusively observing consumers rather than talking to them.
