very safe. 'The big question from consumers is, 'How safe is it?' ... the engineers of the smart did their homework and designed a high level of safety into a very small package.' Adrian Lund, President of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)  2002. smartusa.com open your mind.

Besides these strategic considerations, marketers must enter into and execute co-branding ventures carefully. They must ensure the right kind of fit in values, capabilities, and goals in addition to an appropriate balance of brand equity. When it comes to execution, marketers need detailed plans to legalize contracts, make financial arrangements, and coordinate marketing programs. As one executive at Nabisco put it, “Giving away your brand is a lot like giving away your child—you want to make sure everything is perfect.” The financial arrangement between brands may vary, although typically the firm using the other brand will pay some type of licensing fee and/or royalty from sales. The aim is for the licensor and the licensee to benefit from these agreements as a result of the shared equity, increased awareness for the licensor, and greater sales for the licensee.

More generally, brand alliances, such as co-branding, require marketers to ask themselves a number of questions, such as:

* What capabilities do we *not* have?  
* What resource constraints do we face (people, time, money)?  
* What growth goals or revenue needs do we have?  

In assessing a joint branding opportunity, marketers will ask themselves:

* Is it a profitable business venture?  
* How does it help to maintain or strengthen brand equity?  
* Is there any possible risk of dilution of brand equity?  
* Does it offer any extrinsic advantages such as learning opportunities?  

One of the highest-profile brand alliances was that of Disney and McDonald’s, which had the exclusive global rights from 1996 to 2006 in the fast-food industry to promote everything from Disney movies and videos to TV shows and theme parks. McDonald’s has partnerships with a number of different brands, including leading toy and entertainment companies for its Happy Meals, and Kraft’s Oreo, Hershey’s M&M’s, and Rolo brands for its McFlurry dessert.

### Ingredient Branding

A special case of co-branding is **ingredient branding**, which creates brand equity for materials, components, or parts that are necessarily contained within other branded products.<sup>26</sup> Some successful ingredient brands over the years include Dolby noise reduction, Gore-Tex water-resistant fibers, Teflon nonstick coatings, Stainmaster stain-resistant fibers, and Scotchgard fabrics. Ingredient brands attempt to create enough awareness and preference for their product that consumers will not buy a host product that does not contain the ingredient.
