A highly credible company may be treated more favorably by other external constituencies, such as government or legal officials. It also may be able to attract better-qualified employees and motivate existing employees to be more productive and loyal. As one Shell Oil employee remarked as part of some internal corporate identity research, “If you’re really proud of where you work, I think you put a little more thought into what you did to help get them there.”

A strong corporate reputation can help a firm survive a brand crisis and avert public outrage that could otherwise depress sales or block expansion plans. As Harvard’s Stephen Greyser notes, “Corporate reputation . . . can serve as a capital account of favorable attitudes to help buffer corporate trouble.”

**Summary.** Many intangible brand associations can transcend the physical characteristics of products, providing valuable sources of brand equity and serving as critical points-of-parity or points-of-difference. Companies have a number of means—indirect or direct—of creating these associations. But they must “talk the talk” and “walk the walk” by communicating to consumers and backing up claims with concrete programs consumers can easily understand or even experience.

### Managing the Corporate Brand

A number of specific issues arise in managing a corporate brand. Here we consider three: corporate social responsibility, corporate image campaigns, and corporate name changes.

#### Corporate Social Responsibility.

Some marketing experts believe consumers are increasingly using their perceptions of a firm’s role in society in their purchase decisions. For example, consumers want to know how a firm treats its employees, shareholders, local neighbors, and other stakeholder or constituents. As the head of a large ad agency put it: “The only sustainable competitive advantage any business has is its reputation.”

Consistent with this reasoning, 91 percent of respondents in a large global survey of financial analysts and others in the investment community agreed that a company that fails to look after its reputation will endure financial difficulties. Moreover, 96 percent said the CEO’s reputation was fairly, very, or extremely important in influencing their ratings.

The realization that consumers and others may be interested in issues beyond product characteristics and associations has prompted much marketing activity to establish the proper corporate image. Some firms are putting corporate social responsibility at the very core of their existence.<sup>43</sup> Ben & Jerry’s has created a strong association as a “do-gooder” by using Fair Trade ingredients and donating 7.5 percent of its pretax profits to various causes.
