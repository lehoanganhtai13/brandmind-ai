# BRANDING BRIEF 15-1

## The Brand Report Card

Rate your brand on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = extremely poor; 10 = extremely good) for each of the characteristics below. Create a similar report card for your major competitors. Compare and contrast the results with all the relevant participants in the management of your brand. Doing so should help you identify where you excel, pinpoint areas that need improvement, and learn more about how your particular brand is configured. Be brutally honest in answering the questions—approach them as an outsider and from a consumer perspective.
