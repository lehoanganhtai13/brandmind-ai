### Maintaining Brand Consistency

Without question, the most important consideration in reinforcing brands is consistency in the nature and amount of marketing support the brand receives. Brand consistency is critical to maintaining the strength and favorability of brand associations. Brands with shrinking research and development and marketing communication budgets run the risk of becoming technologically disadvantaged—or even obsolete—as well as out-of-date, irrelevant, or forgotten.

*Market Leaders and Failures.* Inadequate marketing support is an especially dangerous strategy when combined with price increases. An example of failure to adequately support a brand occurred in the kitchen and bath fixtures market.

### DELTA

Delta Faucet, the first company to advertise faucets on television in the 1970s, was the market leader in the 1980s with more than 30 percent market share. Beginning in the 1990s, however, two major factors contributed to a decline in market share. First, whereas Delta had built a strong business model based on the loyalty of professional plumbers, the advent of hardware superstores and online shopping empowered consumers to make their own choices and repairs. Second, Delta’s support for its brand through innovation and advertising diminished during this time. These factors combined to give rival Moen an opportunity to gain market share, and by 2005 each company held 25 percent of the U.S. faucet market. That same year, Delta countered by raising its advertising budget 60 percent and conducting thousands of interviews and other forms of consumer research to feed R&D efforts.<sup>3</sup>

Even a cursory examination of the brands that have maintained market leadership for the last 50 or 100 years or so testifies to the advantages of staying consistent. Brands such as Disney, McDonald’s, Mercedes Benz, and others have been remarkably true to their strategies once they achieved a preeminent market leadership position.

Perhaps an even more compelling demonstration of the benefits of consistency is the fortunes of brands that have constantly repositioned or changed ad agencies. Consider how Michelob’s constant repositioning coincided with a steady sales decline.
