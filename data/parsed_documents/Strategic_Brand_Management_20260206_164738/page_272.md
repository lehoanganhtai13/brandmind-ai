Figure 7-4 presents a comparative analysis of co-branding and licensing, outlining their respective advantages and disadvantages. Co-branding's advantages include increased brand awareness, shared marketing costs, and access to new customer segments, while its disadvantages can involve potential brand dilution, loss of control, and conflicts between partners. Licensing, on the other hand, offers revenue generation through royalties and brand expansion into new product categories, but its drawbacks include potential damage to brand reputation if the licensee produces low-quality goods, loss of direct control over product development and marketing, and the risk of creating a competitor. The figure's structure facilitates a direct comparison of these two distinct brand-leveraging strategies.

Co-branding can reduce the cost of product introduction because it combines two well-known images, accelerating potential adoption. Co-branding also may be a valuable means to learn about consumers and how other companies approach them. In poorly differentiated categories especially, co-branding may be an important means of creating a distinctive product.<sup>20</sup>

The potential disadvantages of co-branding are the risks and lack of control that arise from becoming aligned with another brand in the minds of consumers. Consumer expectations about the level of involvement and commitment with co-brands are likely to be high. Unsatisfactory performance thus could have negative repercussions for both (or all) brands.<sup>21</sup> If the brands are very distinct, consumers may be less sure about what each brand represents.<sup>22</sup> If the other brand has entered into a number of co-branding arrangements, there also may be a risk of overexposure that would dilute the transfer of any association. It may also result in distraction and a lack of focus on existing brands.

### Guidelines  
The *Science of Branding 7-2* provides some academic insight about how consumers evaluate co-branded products. To create a strong co-brand, both brands should have adequate brand awareness; sufficiently strong, favorable, and unique associations; and positive consumer judgments and feelings. Thus, a necessary but not sufficient condition for co-branding success is that the two brands *separately* have some potential brand equity. The most important requirement is a logical fit between the two brands, so that the combined brand or marketing activity maximizes the advantages of the individual brands while minimizing the disadvantages.<sup>23</sup>

### SMART CAR  
Some eyebrows were raised when DaimlerChrysler AG’s Mercedes Benz unit agreed to manufacture a “Swatchmobile,” named after SMH’s colorful and fashionable lines of Swatch watches. Personally championed by SMH’s charismatic chairman, Nicolas Hayek, the Smart Car, as it came to be known, was designed to be small (less than 10 feet long) and low cost (under $10,000). The car combined the three most important features of Swatch watches—affordability, durability, and stylishness—with important features of a Mercedes Benz automobile—safety and security in a crash. A number of critics believed the Mercedes-Benz image could suffer if the car was unsuccessful, which was a possible outcome given the fact that many products bearing the Swatch name (like clothes, bags, telephones, pagers, and sunglasses) had disappointing sales or were dropped altogether. However, those concerns were quickly proven to be incorrect, with their successful launch in Europe. Since then Smart has been a worldwide hit with the Smart Fortwo being sold in over 35 countries worldwide.<sup>24</sup> small can be safe.
