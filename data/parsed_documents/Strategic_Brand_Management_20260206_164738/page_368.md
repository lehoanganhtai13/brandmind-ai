A brand like Planters has many extension opportunities that it should research carefully. Source: Jarrod Weaton/Weaton Digital, Inc.

Consistent with these survey results, besides selling a variety of nuts (peanuts, mixed nuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and so on), Planters now sells trail mix, sunflower seeds, peanut bars, and peanut butter.

**Critique.**  
The main advantage of the marketing-based comparative approach is ease of implementation. We can compare virtually any proposed set of marketing actions for the brand. At the same time, the main drawback is that it may be difficult to discern whether consumer responses to changes in the marketing stimuli are being caused by brand knowledge or by more generic product knowledge. In other words, it may be that for *any* brand in the product category, consumers would be willing to pay certain prices, accept a particular brand extension, and so forth. One way to determine whether consumer response is specific to the brand is to conduct similar tests of consumer response with competitive brands. A statistical technique well suited to do just that is described next.

### Conjoint Analysis  
*Conjoint analysis* is a survey-based multivariate technique that enables marketers to profile the consumer decision process with respect to products and brands.<sup>9</sup> Specifically, by asking consumers to express preferences or choose among a number of carefully designed product profiles, researchers can determine the trade-offs consumers are making between various brand attributes, and thus the importance they are attaching to them.<sup>10</sup>

Each profile consumers see is made up of a set of attribute levels chosen on the basis of experimental design principles to satisfy certain mathematical properties. The value consumers attach to each attribute level, as statistically derived by the conjoint formula, is called a *part worth*. We can use the part worths in various ways to estimate how consumers would value a new combination of the attribute levels. For example, one attribute is the brand name. The part worth for the “brand name” attribute reflects its value.

One classic study of conjoint analysis, reported by Green and Wind, examined consumer evaluations of a spot-remover product on five attributes: package design, brand name, price, *Good Housekeeping* seal, and money-back guarantee.<sup>11</sup> These same authors also applied conjoint analysis in a landmark research study to arrive at the design that became the Courtyard by Marriott hotel chain.<sup>12</sup>

*Applications.*  
Conjoint analysis has a number of possible applications. In the past, Ogilvy & Mather ad agency used a brand/price trade-off methodology as a means of assessing advertising effectiveness and brand value.<sup>13</sup> Brand/price trade-off is a simplified version of A comprehensive conjoint analysis project helped design Courtyard by Marriott to better satisfy consumer needs and desires.
