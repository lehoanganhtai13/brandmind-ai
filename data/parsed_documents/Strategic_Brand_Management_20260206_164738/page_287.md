Eight different ways to leverage secondary associations to build brand equity are linking the brand to (1) the company making the product; (2) the country or some other geographic location in which the product originates; (3) retailers or other channel members that sell the product; (4) other brands, including ingredient brands; (5) licensed characters; (6) famous spokespeople or endorsers; (7) events; and (8) third-party sources.

In general, the extent to which any of these entities can be leveraged as a source of equity depends on consumer knowledge of the entity and how easily the appropriate associations or responses to the entity transfer to the brand. Overall credibility or attitudinal dimensions may be more likely to transfer than specific attribute and benefit associations, although the latter can be transferred, too. Linking the brand to other entities, however, is not without risk. Marketers give up some control, and managing the transfer process so that only the relevant secondary associations become linked to the brand may be a challenge.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. The Boeing Company makes a number of different types of aircraft for the commercial airline industry, for example, the 727, 747, 757, 767, 777, and now the 787 jet models. Is there any way for Boeing to adopt an ingredient branding strategy with its jets? How? What would be the pros and cons?  
2. After winning major championships, star players often complain about their lack of endorsement offers. Similarly, after every Olympics, a number of medal-winning athletes lament their lack of commercial recognition. From a branding perspective, how would you respond to the complaints of these athletes?  
3. Think of the country in which you live. What image might it have with consumers in other countries? Are there certain brands or products that are highly effective in leveraging that image in global markets?  
4. Which retailers have the strongest image and equity in your mind? Think about the brands they sell. Do they contribute to the equity of the retailer? Conversely, how does that retailer’s image help the image of the brands it sells?  
5. Pick a brand. Evaluate how it leverages secondary associations. Can you think of any ways that the brand could more effectively leverage secondary brand associations?

## Going for Corporate Gold at the Olympics

Competition at the Olympics is not restricted to just the athletes. A number of corporate sponsors also vie to maximize the return on their sponsorship dollars. Corporate sponsorship is a significant part of the business side of the Olympics and contributes almost one-third of the revenue of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Countries themselves vie for the rights to host the Games. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, won the rights to host the 2016 Games over Chicago, Madrid, and Tokyo.

### Corporate Sponsorship

Corporate sponsorship of the Olympics exploded with the commercial success of the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. At that time, many international sponsors, like Fuji, achieved positive image building and increased market share.

Eleven companies have paid for the highest level of Olympic sponsorship (TOP)—estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $80 million—for exclusive worldwide marketing rights to the Summer, Winter, and Youth Olympic Games: Acer, Atos Origin, Coca-Cola, Dow, GE, McDonald’s, Omega, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung, and Visa. In addition to exclusive worldwide marketing opportunities, partners receive:

* Use of all Olympic imagery, as well as appropriate Olympic designations on products  
* Hospitality opportunities at the Olympic Games  
* Direct advertising and promotional opportunities, including preferential access to Olympic broadcast advertising  
* On-site concessions/franchise and product sale/showcase opportunities  
* Ambush marketing protection (see below)  
* Acknowledgement of their support though a broad Olympic sponsorship recognition program  

Other tiers at lower levels of sponsorship also exist. For example, London 2012 Official Partners included Adidas, BP, British Airways, BT, EDF Energy, Lloyds TSB, and Nortel.
