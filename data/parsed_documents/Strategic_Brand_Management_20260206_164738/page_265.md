# BRANDING BRIEF 7-1

## IBM Promotes a Smarter Planet

IBM’s long tradition as “Big Blue” helped it become one of the world’s most successful companies of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, many of the product areas on which this success was built became highly competitive and increasingly commoditized in the new millenium. As a result, IBM decided it needed to radically transform itself from a product-focused company to a value-added, services-oriented company.

IBM Chairman and CEO Sam Palmisano spun off the company’s famous PC division and began to invest heavily in software and business consulting. Another critical aspect of the transformation was aligning the public perception of IBM with this new vision. The vision itself—and thus the corresponding marketing communication program—was rooted in a basic belief that the world was changing in three significant ways that provided clear direction to IBM’s new mission. In other words, the world was becoming:

* Instrumented (“Instrument the world’s systems”)
* Interconnected (“Interconnect them”)
* Intelligent (“Make them intelligent”)

IBM wanted to be the leader in each of these three areas. The original name chosen to reflect this new positioning was the very literal “Integrated Intelligent Infrastructure,” but further work led to the snappier, more inspiring “Smarter Planet” phrase that also became the slogan for the corporate campaign. The basic premise of the campaign was that every business would become a technology company and be forced to face new and challenging policy changes, especially with respect to sustainability, security, and privacy. IBM was positioned to be the ideal partner to assist in these efforts. Given the ambitious scope of the positioning, government officials became the target as much as business leaders.

The “Smarter Planet” positioning had its roots in some of IBM’s recent accomplishments. For example, in Stockholm, Sweden, IBM smart traffic systems cut gridlock by 20 percent, reduced emissions by 12 percent, and resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of public transportation. Smart grid projects in various locales had already helped consumers save 10 percent on their bills and reduced peak demand by 15 percent.

With these accomplishments in mind, the initial goal of the “Smarter Planet” campaign was to position IBM as a leader in solving the world’s most pressing problems. Specifically, the marketing objectives were to:

* Be established in 50+ countries.
* Create 300 new client references and business opportunities.
* Change perceptions of and likelihood of doing business with IBM.

Launched in November 2008, one of the first campaign activities was an op-ad series, “Building a Smarter Planet,” targeting forward-thinking leaders. The full-page ads appeared in major newspapers such as the *Wall Street Journal*, *New York Times* and *Financial Times*. They were unusual in the lengthy text that they included. Figure 7-3 has an excerpt from the first ad that describes the rationale behind the campaign.

The campaign also included TV ads and targeted ads to three groups: business and government leaders in large organizations, IT professionals, and the mid-market. It included a strong digital component, with an expanded IBM Web site and a Smarter Planet blog. Videos were created and distributed across eight of the largest video-sharing sites. IBM also launched a “Smarter Cities” global tour to bring key policy and decision makers together to discuss the topical issues they faced, such as transportation, energy, health care, education, and public safety.

IBM analysts estimated that the Smarter Planet strategy expanded its market potential by as much as 40 percent globally, or by an additional $2.3 billion in revenue. IBM’s brand tracking revealed increases across the board on a variety of image measures (such as “making the world a better place” and “an expert in how the world works”) and overall judgments related to consideration, preference, and likelihood of doing business. IBM’s stock price during the campaign increased by 64 percent, while the Dow index grew only 14 percent over the same time.
