with a study administrator, who uses advanced interview techniques to explore the images with the participant and reveal their deep ideas, archetypes, themes, and emotions through a “guided conversation.”  
The interview consists of a series of steps, each with a specific purpose in mind:  
1. *Storytelling*: Exploring individual visual metaphors  
2. *Expand the Frame*: Expanding the metaphoric meaning of images  
3. *Sensory Metaphor*: Eliciting metaphors about the research topic from each sensory modality  
4. *Vignette*: Using the mind’s eye to create a short story about the research topic  
5. *Digital Image*: Integrating the images to create a visual summary of the research topic  

Once the participants’ interviews have been completed, researchers identify key themes or constructs, code the data, and assemble a consensus map of the most important constructs. Quantitative analyses of the data can provide information for advertising, promotions, and other marketing decisions.  

ZMET has been applied in a variety of different ways, including as a means to help understand consumers’ images of brands, products, and companies. Marketers can employ ZMET for a variety of consumer-insight research topics. Zaltman lists several of these:  

> ZMET is useful in understanding consumers’ images of brands, products, companies, brand equity, product concepts and designs, product usage and purchase experiences, life experiences, consumption context, and attitudes toward business.  

For example, DuPont enlisted Zaltman to research women’s attitudes toward hosiery. Conventional research yielded the conclusion that “women mostly hated wearing pantyhose,” but DuPont market researchers were not convinced that this conclusion provided a complete picture. Zaltman used ZMET with 20 subjects in order to uncover deeper answers to the question, “What are your thoughts and feelings about buying and wearing pantyhose?” He discovered that women had a “like–hate” relationship with pantyhose; they disliked the discomfort and run-proneness of pantyhose but liked the feel of elegance and sexiness they got from wearing it. This discovery prompted a number of hosiery manufacturers to include more sexy and alluring imagery in their advertising. Figure 9-3 displays a consensus map that emerged from a study of intimate apparel.  

## Neural Research Methods  
Taking ZMET one step further to dig even deeper into the subconscious, some marketing researchers are bypassing any verbal response from consumers to literally get inside the minds of consumers through various neural research methods. *Neuromarketing* is the study of how the  

This table outlines perceived attributes and outcomes associated with garments, categorized by "Garment attributes" and "Quality garment." Under "Garment attributes," several concepts are presented, including "Coordinated," "Expense," "Sexy," "Attractive to others," "Self-confidence," and "Achievement." These are further elaborated with related concepts such as "Aggravation," "Acceptance by others," and "Project self-image." The "Quality garment" section introduces "Physical imprisonment," "Physical comfort," "Obligatory wearing," "Emotional freedom" (crossed out), "Happy," and "Elegant." Additional related concepts in this section include "Concern," "Emotionally comfortable," "Variety of design," "Feel thin," and "Physical control," alongside "Anger." The structure appears to be a comparative or associative mapping of garment characteristics to psychological and social outcomes.

This table outlines a fundamental structural model for representing relationships between concepts. It defines three core construct types: an "Originator construct" which initiates or is the source of a relationship, a "Destination construct" which is the target or recipient of that relationship, and a "Connector construct" that explicitly defines and links the originator and destination. This structure implies a directed relationship, where information, influence, or causality flows from the originator, through the connector, to the destination. The overall organization is hierarchical or relational, emphasizing the directed nature of interactions and dependencies between distinct conceptual entities. brain responds to marketing stimuli, including brands.¹⁶ For example, some firms are applying sophisticated techniques such as EEG (electroencephalograph) technology to monitor brain activity and better gauge consumer responses to marketing.
