This data presents a multi-faceted framework for understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics, structured around distinct categories. Economic indicators such as interest rates, unemployment, and income levels are juxtaposed with media indicators like media consumption time and advertising expenditure. Retail metrics, including total supermarket spending and house brand growth, are presented alongside demographic profiles detailing population characteristics and geographic distribution. Technological adoption, encompassing home computer ownership, internet access, and various electronic devices, is contrasted with other products and services, such as transportation ownership and travel habits. Finally, personal attitudes and values, including confidence, security, and environmental concerns, are explored in relation to attitudes towards brands and shopping, such as price sensitivity, preference for new products, and the importance of brand familiarity and advertising. This structure suggests a comprehensive approach to market analysis, linking macro-economic and media trends with micro-level consumer attributes and preferences.

### MILLWARD BROWN

Millward Brown has led the innovation and implementation of tracking studies for the last 30 years. In general, the firm interviews 50–100 people a week and looks at the data with moving averages trended over time. Then it relates specific marketing activity and events to the trend data to understand their impact. Client brands are typically compared to a competitive set to determine relative performance within the product category. Millward Brown collects data on a variety of topics as dictated by the client needs. Modules include brand equity (current and future potential), brand positioning, value perceptions, awareness and response to marketing communications and in-store promotions, consumer profiles, and so on. The survey data is analyzed in conjunction with a variety of other data sources (traditional and social media, search data, sales data, etc.) to provide guidance on improving marketing ROI. Interviews on average run from 15 to 20 minutes in length (on the Web, the phone—both landline and mobile—and in-person in emerging markets). A 20-minute weekly interview with 50 nationally representative consumers can cost roughly $300,000 annually for a typical consumer product, depending on modality.<sup>11</sup>

When the brand has more stable and enduring associations, tracking on a less frequent basis can be enough. Nevertheless, even if the marketing of a brand does not appreciably change over time, competitive entries can change consumer perceptions of the dynamics within the market, making tracking critical. Finally, the stage of the product or brand life cycle will affect your decision about the frequency of tracking: Opinions of consumers in mature markets may not change much, whereas emerging markets may shift quickly and perhaps unpredictably.
