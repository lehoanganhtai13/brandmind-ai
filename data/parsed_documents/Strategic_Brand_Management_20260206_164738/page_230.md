# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 6-1

## The Importance of Database Marketing

Regardless of the particular means of direct marketing, database marketing can help create targeted communication and marketing programs tailored to the needs and wants of specific consumers. When customers place orders, send in a coupon, fill out a warranty card, or enter a sweepstakes, database marketers collect their names and information about their attitudes and behavior, which they compile in a comprehensive database.

Database marketing is generally more effective at helping firms retain existing customers than in attracting new ones. Many marketers believe it makes more sense the higher the price of the product and the more often consumers buy it. Database marketing is often at the heart of a successful loyalty rewards program. Best Western uses both online and mail outlets to contact its program participants and relies on database information to improve the relevance and timeliness of its messages.

> Database marketing pioneers include a number of financial services firms and airlines. Even packaged-goods companies, however, are exploring the possible benefits of database marketing. For example, Procter & Gamble created a database to market Pampers disposable diapers, allowing it to send out individualized birthday cards for babies and reminder letters to parents to move their child up to the next size. Combining this effort with a well-developed help line and Web site and in-store couponing, P&G is creating interactive, individualized, value-added contacts.

> Database management tools will become a priority to marketers as they attempt to track the lifetime value (LTV) of customers. Some database marketing activities that can occur through the application of LTV analysis include predictive modeling, multiple campaign management, targeted promotions, up-selling, cross-selling, segmentation, churn management, multichannel management, product personalization, and acquisition and retention management.

Broadly defined category that captures advertising outside traditional media. Increasingly, ads and commercials are showing up in unusual spots, sometimes as parts of experiential marketing programs.

The rationale is that because traditional advertising media—especially television advertising—are becoming less effective, marketers are better off reaching people in other environments, such as where they work, play, and, of course, shop. Out-of-home advertising picked up as the economy started to pick up in 2010, when it was estimated that $6.1 billion was spent.<sup>28</sup> Some of the options include billboards and posters; movies, airlines, lounges, and other places; product placement; and point-of-purchase advertising.

### Billboards and Posters

Billboards have a long history but have been transformed over the years and now employ colorful, digitally produced graphics, backlighting, sounds, movement, and unusual—even three-dimensional—images to attract attention. The medium has improved in terms of effectiveness (and measurability), technology (some billboards are now digitized), and provide a good opportunity for companies to sync their billboard strategies with mobile advertising.

Billboard-type poster ads are now showing up everywhere in the United States each year to increase brand exposure and goodwill. Transit ads on buses, subways, and commuter trains—around for years—have now become a valuable means to reach working women. Street furniture (bus shelters, kiosks, and public areas) has also become a fast-growing area. In Japan, cameras and sensors are being added to signs and electronic public displays so that—combined with cell-phone technology—they can become more interactive and personalized.<sup>29</sup>

Billboards do not even necessarily have to stay in one place. Marketers can buy ad space on billboard-laden trucks that are driven around all day in marketer-selected areas. Oscar Mayer sends seven “Wienermobiles” traveling across the country each year. New York City became the Oscar Meyer’s Weinermobile, with its two Hotdoggers drivers, tour the country and make appearances at various events.
