Often, the strongest brand positioning relies on performance advantages of some kind, and it is rare that a brand can overcome severe performance deficiencies. Five important types of attributes and benefits often underlie brand performance, as follows:  

1. **Primary ingredients and supplementary features.** Customers often have beliefs about the levels at which the primary ingredients of the product operate (low, medium, high, or very high), and about special, perhaps even patented, features or secondary elements that complement these primary ingredients. Some attributes are essential ingredients necessary for a product to work, whereas others are supplementary features that allow for customization and more versatile, personalized usage. Of course these vary by product or service category.  
2. **Product reliability, durability, and serviceability. Reliability** measures the consistency of performance over time and from purchase to purchase. *Durability* is the expected economic life of the product, and *serviceability,* the ease of repairing the product if needed. Thus, perceptions of product performance are affected by factors such as the speed, accuracy, and care of product delivery and installation; the promptness, courtesy, and helpfulness of customer service and training; and the quality of repair service and the time involved.  
3. **Service effectiveness, efficiency, and empathy.** Customers often have performance-related associations with service. *Service effectiveness* measures how well the brand satisfies customers’ service requirements. *Service efficiency* describes the speed and responsiveness of service. Finally, *service empathy* is the extent to which service providers are seen as trusting, caring, and having the customer’s interests in mind.  
4. **Style and design.** Design has a functional aspect in terms of how a product works that affects performance associations. Consumers also may have associations with the product that go beyond its functional aspects to more aesthetic considerations such as its size, shape, materials, and color involved. Thus, performance may also depend on sensory aspects such as how a product looks and feels, and perhaps even what it sounds or smells like.  
5. **Price.** The pricing policy for the brand can create associations in consumers’ minds about how relatively expensive (or inexpensive) the brand is, and whether it is frequently or substantially discounted. Price is a particularly important performance association because consumers may organize their product category knowledge in terms of the price tiers of different brands.  

## Brand Imagery

The other main type of brand meaning is brand imagery. Brand imagery depends on the extrinsic properties of the product or service, including the ways in which the brand attempts to meet customers’ psychological or social needs. It is the way people think about a brand abstractly, rather than what they think the brand actually does. Thus, imagery refers to more intangible aspects of the brand, and consumers can form imagery associations directly from their own experience or indirectly through advertising or by some other source of information, such as word of mouth. Many kinds of intangibles can be linked to a brand, but four main ones are:  

1. User profiles  
2. Purchase and usage situations  
3. Personality and values  
4. History, heritage, and experiences  

For example, take a brand with rich brand imagery such as Nivea in Europe, makers of many different skin care and personal care products. Some of its more notable intangible associations include: (1) family/shared experiences/maternal, (2) multipurpose, (3) classic/timeless, and (4) childhood memories. Luxury brands often rely a great deal on brand intangibles, as described in *The Science of Branding* 3-1.  

**User Imagery.** One set of brand imagery associations is about the type of person or organization who uses the brand. This imagery may result in customers’ mental image of actual users or more aspirational, idealized users. Consumers may base associations of a typical or idealized Luxury brands are perhaps one of the purest examples of branding, because the brand and its image are often key competitive advantages.
