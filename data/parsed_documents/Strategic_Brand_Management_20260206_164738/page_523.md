# BRANDING BRIEF 14-2

## Coca-Cola Becomes the Quintessential Global Brand

The name Coca-Cola was registered as a trademark on January 31, 1893. The drink soon became a national phenomenon; by 1895, the company had established syrup plants in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles.

In the 1920s, Coca-Cola pursued aggressive global branding, finding such creative placements for its logo as on dogsleds in Canada and on the walls of bullfighting arenas in Spain. Its popularity throughout the world was fueled by colorful and persuasive advertising that cemented its image as the “All-American” beverage. When the Vietnam War tarnished the U.S. iconography, Coca-Cola developed more globally aware advertising. In 1971, it ran its legendary “I’d like to buy the world a Coke” television spot, in which a crowd of children sang the song from atop a hill in Italy. Coca-Cola’s early moves into formerly restricted markets, such as China in 1978 and the Soviet Union in 1979, bolstered its image as a global company. By 1988, Coca-Cola was voted the best known and most admired brand in the world.

Despite—or perhaps as a result of—this immense scope, Coca-Cola did not institute a uniform marketing program in each of its global markets. Rather, the company often tailored the flavor, packaging, price, and advertising to match tastes in specific markets. For example, Coke’s famous “Mean Joe” Green TV ad from the United States—in which the weary football star reluctantly accepts a Coke from an admiring young fan and then unexpectedly tosses the kid his jersey in appreciation—was replicated in a number of different regions using the same format but substituting famous athletes from those regions (ads in South America used the Argentine soccer star Maradona, while those in Asia used the Thai soccer star Niat).

Local managers were assigned responsibility for sales and distribution programs of Coke products, to reflect the marked differences in consumer behavior across countries. Perhaps the most consistently standardized element of Coca-Cola is its product appearance. Coke essentially keeps the same basic look and packaging of the product everywhere (except in countries where laws dictate use of the local language). The company simultaneously stresses that the brand be *relevant* and *well positioned* against the competition. To keep it relevant, Coca-Cola uses different advertising agencies in different countries in order to make the brand feel local.

knocking on the door was rude; in Kuwait, the delivery was just as likely to be made to a limousine as to a house; and in Japan, houses were not numbered sequentially, making finding a particular address difficult.

Although Heineken is seen as an everyday brand in the Netherlands, it is considered a “top-shelf” brand almost everywhere else. A case of the beer costs almost twice as much in the United States as the most popular U.S. brand, Budweiser. For a long time, Heineken’s slogan in the United Kingdom and other countries—”Heineken Refreshes the Parts Other Beers Can’t Reach”—was different from its U.S. positioning.

As these examples suggest, top brands adapt their marketing programs in different parts of the world. We next review the four major elements of a marketing program—product, communications, distribution, and pricing strategies—in terms of adaptation issues.

### Product Strategy.

One reason so many companies ran into trouble initially going overseas is that they unknowingly—or perhaps even deliberately—overlooked differences in consumer behavior. Because of the relative expense and sometimes unsophisticated nature of the marketing research industry in smaller markets, many companies chose to forgo basic consumer research and put products on the shelf to see what would happen.
