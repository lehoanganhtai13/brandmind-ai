# Private-Label Branding Strategy

Although the growth of private labels has been interpreted by some as a sign of the decline of brands, the opposite conclusion may in fact be more valid: private-label growth could be seen in some ways as a consequence of cleverly designed branding strategies. In terms of building brand equity, the key point-of-difference for private labels in consumers’ eyes has always been “good value,” a desirable and transferable association across many product categories. As a result, private labels can be extremely broad, and their name can be applied across many diverse products.

As with national brands, implementing a value-pricing strategy for private labels requires determining the right price and product offering. For example, one reported rule of thumb is that the typical “no-name” product has to sell for at least 15 percent less than a national brand, on average, to be successful. The challenge for private labels has been to determine the appropriate product offering.

Specifically, to achieve the necessary points-of-parity, or even to create their own points-of-difference, private labels have been improving quality, and as a result are now aggressively positioning against even national brands. In its September 2010 study, *Consumer Reports* conducted taste tests in 21 categories comparing the two and found that national brands won seven times, private labels won three times, with the rest resulting in a tie. *Consumer Reports* concluded that consumers could cut their costs by as much as half by switching to a store brand.<sup>100</sup>

Many supermarket chains have introduced their own premium store brands, such as Safeway Select, Von’s Royal Request, and Ralph’s Private Selection. For example, A&P positioned its premium Master Choice brand to fill the void between the mass-market national brands and the upscale specialty brands it sells. It has used the brand across a wide range of products, such as teas, pastas, sauces, and salad dressings. Trader Joe’s offers 2,000 private-label products—only 10 percent of what would be found in a typical supermarket—but creates a fun, roomy atmosphere for bargain seekers wanting the best in gourmet-style foods, health food supplements, and wines.<sup>101</sup>

Sellers of private labels are also adopting more extensive marketing communication programs to spread the word about their brands. For example, Walgreens launched its first national advertising campaign for Walgreens-branded health and wellness products in February 2011. The campaign emphasized the durability and quality of the Walgreens-brand products, using the store’s 26,000 pharmacists as endorsers.<sup>102</sup> Loblaws has been a pioneer in marketing its private-label brands.

> ### LOBLAWS  
> Loblaws is Canada’s largest food distributor. In 1978, Loblaws was the first store in Canada to introduce generics, reflecting a carefully crafted strategy to build an image of quality and high value in six areas. By 1983, Loblaws carried over 500 generic products that accounted for 10 percent of store sales. This success was due to innovative marketing, low costs, and a large network of suppliers. In 1984, Loblaws chose to introduce a private-label brand, President’s Choice, which was designed to offer unique value through exceptional quality and moderate prices. These categories ranged from basic supermarket categories such as chocolate chip cookies, colas, and cereals to more exotic categories such as Devonshire custard from England and gourmet Russian mustard. These products also used distinctive and attractive packaging with modern lettering and colorful labels and names (“decadent” cookies, “ultimate” frozen pizza, and “too good to be true” peanut butter).  
> In terms of marketing communications, Loblaws put into place a strong promotional program with much in-store merchandising. Loblaws also introduced its *Insider’s Report*, a quarterly publication featuring its own store brands and offering consumers shopping tips.<sup>103</sup>

# Major Brand Response to Private Labels

Procter & Gamble’s value-pricing program was one strategy to combat competitive inroads from private labels and other brands. To compete with private labels, a number of different other tactics also have been adopted by marketers of major national or manufacturer brands (see Figure 5-7).

First, marketers of major brands have attempted to decrease costs and reduce price to negate the primary point-of-difference of private labels and achieve a critical point-of-parity. In many categories, prices of major brands had crept up to a point at which price premiums over private labels were 30–50 percent, or even 100 percent. In those categories in which consumers make frequent purchases, the cost savings of “trading down” to a private label brand were therefore quite substantial.

In instances in which major brands and private labels are on a more equal footing with regard to price, major brands often compete well because of other favorable brand perceptions that consumers might have. Procter & Gamble, Colgate, and Unilever cut prices on a number of old standbys during the recent recession to help fend off private-label competition.

One problem faced by marketers of major brands is that it can be difficult to actually lower prices even if they so desire. Supermarkets may not pass along the wholesale price cuts they are given. Moreover, marketers of major brands may not want to alienate retailers by attacking their store brands too forcefully, especially in zero-sum categories in which their brands could be easily replaced.

Figure 5-7 outlines the major brand responses to the emergence of private labels, presenting a multi-faceted strategy. These responses primarily focus on cost management and product differentiation. Key actions include decreasing costs and cutting prices to remain competitive, alongside increasing research and development (R&D) expenditures to enhance existing products and foster innovation. Brands also aim to bolster their market presence by increasing advertising and promotion budgets, and by streamlining their portfolios through the elimination of stagnant brands and extensions to concentrate resources. Furthermore, companies may introduce discount "fighter" brands to directly counter private label offerings, or even choose to supply private label makers themselves. Finally, a strategic approach involves closely tracking the growth of store brands and tailoring competitive efforts on a market-by-market basis. Besides these various pricing moves to achieve points-of-parity, marketers of major brands have used other tactics to achieve additional points-of-difference to combat the threat of private labels.
