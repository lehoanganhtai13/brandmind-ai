# GLOBAL BRAND STRATEGY

With that background, let’s turn to some basic strategic issues in global branding. The contention of this chapter is that in building brand equity, we often must create different marketing programs to satisfy different market segments. Therefore we must:

1. Identify differences in consumer behavior—how consumers purchase and use *products* and what they know and feel about *brands*—in each market.  
2. Adjust the branding program accordingly through the choice of brand elements, the nature of the actual marketing program and activities, and the leveraging of secondary associations.

Note that the third way to build global brand equity, leveraging secondary brand associations, is probably the most likely to require change across countries because the entities linked to a brand may take on very different meanings in different countries. For example, U.S. companies such as Coca-Cola, Levi Strauss, and Nike traditionally gained an important source of equity in going overseas by virtue of their U.S. heritage, which is not as much of an issue or asset in their domestic market. Harley-Davidson has aggressively marketed its classic U.S. image—customized for different cultures—to generate about 30 percent of its sales from abroad.<sup>27</sup> Brands large and small can try to tap into their geographical roots. Gosling’s Black Seal Bermuda black rum uses its Caribbean heritage and its trademarked ingredient in the “dark and stormy” cocktail in its efforts to build a global brand.<sup>28</sup>

Understanding how consumers actually form their impressions of country of origin and update their brand knowledge can be challenging.<sup>29</sup> The design, manufacture, assembly, distribution, and marketing of products often involve several countries. Apple’s iPhone is designed and owned by a U.S. company and assembled and shipped from China from parts produced largely in several Asian and European countries.<sup>30</sup>

## Global Brand Equity

As we explained in Chapter 3, to build brand resonance, marketers must (1) establish breadth and depth of brand awareness; (2) create points-of-parity and points-of-difference; (3) elicit positive, accessible brand responses; and (4) forge intense, active brand relationships. Achieving these four steps, in turn, requires establishing six core brand building blocks: brand salience, brand performance, brand imagery, brand judgments, brand feelings, and brand resonance. In each and every market in which marketers sell the brand, they must consider how to achieve these steps and create these building blocks. Some of the issues that come into play are discussed in the following subsections.
