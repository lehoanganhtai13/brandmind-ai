This figure outlines additional guidelines for small businesses, presenting a structured approach to business development and management. The core components appear to be categorized into distinct areas, suggesting a framework for operational enhancement. Key relationships are implied through the organization of these guidelines, likely indicating a progression or interdependency between different aspects of small business operations. The overarching structure seems to be a comparative or checklist-based format, designed to provide actionable advice and best practices. This could involve comparing current practices against recommended standards or detailing a series of steps to achieve specific business objectives. The guidelines likely cover areas such as financial management, marketing strategies, operational efficiency, and legal compliance, all crucial for the sustained growth and success of a small enterprise.

brand associations. By cooperating with and perhaps even enhancing manufacturers’ push strategies, retailers should be able to sell products at higher prices and margins.

*Establish brand equity at all levels of the brand hierarchy by offering added value in the selection, purchase, or delivery of product offerings.* Retailers must create their own strong, favorable, and unique associations that go beyond the products they sell. Victoria’s Secret has gained popularity as a provider of stylish feminine clothing. Costco has created a strong discount association. To communicate these broader associations, image campaigns often focus on the advantages to consumers of shopping at and buying from the stores in general, rather than on promotions for specific sale items. For example, Ace Hardware advertises itself as the helpful hardware place.

*Create multichannel shopping experiences.* Retailers are selling their wares in a variety of channels, such as physical stores, catalogs, and online Web sites. Office Depot recognized the importance of supplementing its 800-plus stores with a strong online and catalog presence. By offering service and convenience—and by not cutting its prices—Office Depot has been able to maintain its market leadership. Regardless of the channel, consumers must have rewarding shopping experiences in searching, choosing, paying for, and receiving products. In some case, these experiences may turn out to be valuable points-of-difference, or at least necessary points-of-parity, with respect to competitors.

*Avoid overbranding.* Finally, if a retailer is selling its own private labels, it is important not to employ too many brands. Retailers are particularly susceptible to “bottom-up branding,” in which each department creates its own set of brands. Nordstrom found itself supporting scores of various brands across its different departments, sometimes with little connection among them. Recall from Chapter 5 that one advantage of store brands, however, is that they often represent associations that transfer across categories. The more an abstract association like value or fashionability is desirable and deliverable across categories, the more likely that the marketer can gain efficiencies by concentrating on a few major brands.

## Small Businesses

Building brands is a challenge for small businesses because of their limited resources and budgets. They usually do not have the luxury of making mistakes and must design and implement marketing programs much more carefully.<sup>15</sup> Nevertheless, many entrepreneurs have built their brands into powerhouses essentially from scratch.

Online footwear retailer Zappos, founded by Tony Hsieh, has become a top brand in a little over a decade because of its relentless customer focus and strong corporate culture.

With free shipping and returns, 24/7 customer service, and fast turnaround on a wide selection of 200,000 styles of shoes from 1,200 makers, Zappos finds that three-fourths of its purchases during any one day are from repeat customers. Bought by Amazon in 2009 for a reported $850 million but still run separately, the company now also sells clothing, handbags, and accessories.<sup>16</sup>

Because there are usually limited resources behind a small-business brand, marketing focus and consistency are critically important. Creativity is also paramount for finding new ways to market ideas about products to consumers. Figure 15-16 displays some specific branding guidelines for small businesses.

*Emphasize building one or two strong brands.* Given fewer resources, strategically it may be necessary to emphasize building one or two strong brands. A corporate branding strategy can be an efficient means to build brand equity, although the focus may just be on a major family brand. For example, Intuit concentrated its marketing efforts on building the Quicken brand name of software.

*Focus the marketing program on one or two key associations.* Small businesses often must rely on only one or two key associations as points-of-difference, consistently reinforcing them across the marketing program and over time. Former Navy SEAL Alden Mills created the Perfect Pushup, adding rotation to the classic U-shaped push-up stands to provide more natural movement and engage more muscles while going easy on the joints. Sales-generating print ads, direct-response TV ads, and a Web site hammered home the founder’s exemplary Navy SEAL credentials and the significant fitness benefits of the product’s unique design.<sup>17</sup>

*Employ a well-integrated set of brand elements.* Tactically, it is important for small businesses to maximize the contribution of each of the three main ways to build brand equity. First, a distinctive, well-integrated set of brand elements will enhance both brand awareness and brand image, as suggested by Smartfood popcorn. The company introduced its first product without any advertising, using a unique package that served as a strong visual symbol on the shelf and an extensive sampling program that encouraged trial. Proper names or family names that often characterize small businesses can provide distinctiveness, but if they lack pronounceability, meaningfulness, memorability, and other branding considerations, founders should explore other brand names and brand elements.

*Design creative brand-building push campaigns and consumer-involving pull campaigns that capture attention and generate demand.* Small businesses must design creative push and pull programs that capture the attention of consumers and other channel members alike. Clearly, this is a sizable challenge on a limited budget. Unfortunately, without a strong pull campaign creating product interest, retailers may not feel enough motivation to stock and support the brand.
