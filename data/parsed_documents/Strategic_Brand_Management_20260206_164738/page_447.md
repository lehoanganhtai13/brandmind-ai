> Among the new products Branson is launching are Virgin Oceanic for oceanic exploration and Virgin Galactic for space tourism on rocket ships. Yet Virgin has become more disciplined about its expansion in recent years: The company pursues new businesses only if they are expected to generate more than $150 million in sales within three years. Virgin is also placing great emphasis on sustainability and the environment. Its Web site describes its mission as “to contribute to creating happy and fulfilling lives which are also sustainable.”

## Can Succeed but Hurt the Image of the Parent Brand

In a classic example, Miller Brewing has had much difficulty creating a “hearty” association to its flagship Miller High Life beer brand, in part because of its clear bottle and its advertising heritage as the “champagne of bottled beer.” It has often been argued that Miller Lite’s early success—its extension-market share soared from 9.5 percent in 1978 to 19 percent in 1986—only exacerbated customers’ tendency to think of Miller High Life as “watery” and not a full-bodied beer. These unfavorable perceptions may have contributed to the decline of Miller High Life, whose market share slid from 21 percent to 12 percent during that same eight-year period.

## Can Dilute Brand Meaning

The potential drawbacks of a brand extension’s lack of identification with any one category and a weakened image may be especially evident with high-quality or prestige brands. Consider how Gucci ran into the hazards of overexpansion.

### GUCCI

In its prime, the Gucci brand symbolized luxury, status, elegance, and quality. By the 1980s, however, the label had become tarnished by sloppy manufacturing, countless knock-offs, and even a family feud among the managing Gucci brothers. The product line consisted of 22,000 items, distributed extensively across all types of department stores. Not only were there too many items, but some did not even fit the Gucci image—for example, a cheap canvas pocketbook with the double-G logo that was easily counterfeited and sold on the street for $35. Sales recovered only when Gucci refocused the brand, paring the product line to 7,000 high-end items and selling them through its own company-owned outlets. The strategy helped propel Gucci to the height of the fashion business. With sales of $21 billion in 2010, Gucci is consistently ranked in the world’s top 50 brands in value by Interbrand.<sup>30</sup>

To protect their brands from dilution, many up-and-coming fashion companies and designers seeking to establish their brand through a family of brand extensions are now forging exclusive licensing partnerships with a single retailer. Target started with exclusive deals with architect and designer Michael Graves and continued with later deals with Todd Oldham, Mossimo, Isaac Mizrahi, and as of the 2011 holiday season, singer Gwen Stefani.<sup>31</sup> These exclusive licenses enable the licensor to better control the inventory, avoid discounts, and, most importantly, protect the brand.

## Can Cause the Company to Forgo the Chance to Develop a New Brand

One easily overlooked disadvantage of brand extensions is that by introducing a new product as a brand extension, the company forgoes the chance to create a *new* brand, with its own unique image and equity. For example, consider the benefits Disney enjoyed from introducing Touchstone Pictures films, which attracted an audience interested in more adult themes and situations than its traditional family-oriented releases, or the boost Levi’s earned from Dockers pants, which attracted a segment looking for casual pants. Amazon’s runaway success with Kindle suggests another example.
