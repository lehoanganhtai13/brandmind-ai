Even strict adherents of EDLP, however, see the need for some types of price discounts over time. When P&G encountered some difficulties in the late 1990s, it altered its value-pricing strategy in some segments and reinstated selected price promotions. More recently, P&G has adopted a more fluid pricing strategy in reaction to market conditions.⁶⁶ Although P&G lowered prices in 2010 to try to gain market share in the depths of a severe recession, the company actually raised some prices to offset rising commodity costs in 2011. Management felt confident about the strength of some of the firm’s popular premium-priced brands—such as Fusion ProGlide, Crest 3-D products, and Old Spice body wash—where demand had actually even exceeded supply.

As Chapter 6 will discuss, well-conceived, timely sales promotions can provide important financial incentives to consumers and induce sales. As part of revenue-management systems or yield-management systems, many firms have been using sophisticated models and software to determine the optimal schedule for markdowns and discounts.⁶⁷

**Reasons for Price Stability.** Why then do firms seek greater price stability? Manufacturers can be hurt by an overreliance on trade and consumer promotions and the resulting fluctuations in prices for several reasons.

For example, although trade promotions are supposed to result in discounts on products only for a certain length of time and in a certain geographic region, that is not always the case. With *forward buying*, retailers order more product than they plan to sell during the promotional period so that they can later obtain a bigger margin by selling the remaining goods at the regular price after the promotional period has expired. With *diverting*, retailers pass along or sell the discounted products to retailers outside the designated selling area.

From the manufacturer’s perspective, these retailer practices created production complications: factories had to run overtime because of excess demand during the promotion period but had slack capacity when the promotion period ended, costing manufacturers millions. On the demand side, many marketers felt that the seesaw of high and low prices on products actually trained consumers to wait until the brand was discounted or on special to buy it, thus eroding its perceived value.
