This table presents a comparative structure, juxtaposing desirable product attributes with potential psychological benefits. On one side, it lists tangible features such as a "stylish and attractive look and design" and "high-quality food." These attributes are directly linked to intangible, internal motivations on the other side, specifically "Social approval?" and "Self-respect?". The implied relationship is that possessing products with these desirable characteristics can lead to or fulfill these psychological needs, suggesting a model where product features serve as a means to achieve social validation and enhance one's sense of self-worth.

Of corporate credibility we identified in Chapter 2, you can consider other measures of corporate brand associations including the following (illustrated with the GE corporate brand):

* How well managed is GE?  
* How easy is it to do business with GE?  
* How concerned is GE with its customers?  
* How approachable is GE?  
* How accessible is GE?  
* How much do you like doing business with GE?  
* How likely are you to invest in GE stock?  
* How would you feel if a good friend accepted employment with GE?  

The actual questions should reflect the level and nature of experience your respondents are likely to have had with the company.  

When a brand is identified with multiple products, as in a corporate or family branding strategy, one important issue is which particular products the brand reminds consumers of. At the same time, marketers also want to know which particular products are most influential in affecting consumer perceptions about the brand.  

To identify these more influential products, ask consumers which products they associate with the brand on an unaided basis (“What products come to mind when you think of the Nike brand?”) or an aided basis by listing sub-brand names (“Are you aware of Nike Air Force basketball shoes? Nike Sphere React tennis apparel? Nike Air Max running shoes?”). To better understand the dynamics between the brand and its corresponding products, also ask consumers about their relationship between them (“There are many different products associated with Nike. Which ones are most important to you in formulating your opinion about the brand?”).  

### Global Tracking.  
If your tracking covers diverse geographic markets—especially in both developing and developed countries—then you may need a broader set of background measures to put the brand development in those markets in the right perspective.
