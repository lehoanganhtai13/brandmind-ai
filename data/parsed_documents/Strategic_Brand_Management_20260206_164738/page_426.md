sales in 2010. General Mills started the the highly successful Save Lids to Save Lives cause-marketing program for Yoplait in 1998. For each pink lid customers redeem online or through the mail from September through December each year, Yoplait donates 10 cents to Susan G. Komen for the Cure, up to $2 million. Yoplait is also the National Series Presenting Sponsor of the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. The program’s Web site allows participants to share stories, make dedications, and learn more about breast cancer. The program raised over $30 million in its first 13 years, boosting Yoplait sales in the process.  

## Green Marketing

A special case of cause marketing is *green marketing*. Although environmental issues have long affected marketing practices, especially in Europe, companies are increasingly recognizing that the environment is an important issue to their customers and shareholders and, therefore, to their bottom lines. Research shows the environment is one of the top five issues that youth care most about.

One survey revealed that two-thirds of leaders of major brands believe sustainability initiatives were critical to stay competitive. Firms like Kimberly-Clark, HP, and GE stated that it was a key priority. “For us now, it’s about looking at the full spectrum of sustainability,” said one senior executive at Kimberly-Clark, who noted the firm is seeking to generate 25 percent of 2015 net sales from sustainable products in its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) group. Here is what GE is doing.

> **GE**  
> Despite its industrial past, GE views eco-friendly products as a high-growth business. Spurred by environmental concerns voiced by its customers, GE and CEO Jeffrey Immelt launched Ecomagination in 2005, the name of which is a play on its ongoing corporate campaign “Imagination at Work.” The initiative focused on how to effectively and efficiently “create, connect to, and use power and water” and committed $1.5 billion in annual investment to research and technology into cleaner technologies. Some of its goals were to double GE revenue from sales of products and services that provide environmental advantages, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the energy efficiency of operations. GE built an Ecomagination advertising campaign that targeted business-to-business customers, investors, employees, and consumers. In a 2011 letter to investors, customers, and other stakeholders to mark its progress, the company was able to note these achievements in the first five years of the program:

The provided data outlines the achievements of an initiative, likely a corporate sustainability program, within its first five years. Key accomplishments include substantial financial investment in clean-technology research and development, totaling $5 billion. This investment translated into significant revenue generation, with $85 billion earned from "Ecomagination" products and solutions. The initiative also demonstrated considerable environmental impact, achieving a 22 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 30 percent reduction in water use. Furthermore, operational efficiencies were realized through $130 million in energy efficiency savings. The structure of the data is comparative, highlighting quantifiable outcomes across financial investment, revenue generation, and environmental performance.

> GE also launched a Smart Grid initiative—“a vision for a smarter, more efficient, and sustainable electrical energy grid that GE technology is helping to bring to life.”  

On the corporate side, a host of marketing initiatives have been undertaken by a wide variety of firms with environmental overtones. The auto industry is responding to the dual motivators of concerned consumers and rising oil prices by introducing gas-saving and emission-reducing hybrid models. McDonald’s has introduced a number of well-publicized environmental initiatives through the years, such as moving to unbleached paper carry-out bags and replacing polystyrene foam sandwich clamshells with paper wraps and lightweight recyclable boxes.

From a branding perspective, however, green marketing programs have not always been entirely successful. What obstacles have they encountered?

### Overexposure and Lack of Credibility.

So many companies have made environmental claims that the public has sometimes become skeptical of their validity. What does it mean when a product claims it is “organic,” “fair trade,” or “eco-friendly?” Government investigations into some “green” claims, like the degradability of trash bags, and media reports of the spotty environmental track records behind others have only increased consumers’ doubts. This backlash has led many consumers to consider environmental claims to be marketing gimmicks.

Efforts to provide consumers with more information have sometimes only complicated the situation. Hundreds of different product labels have been introduced, for instance. Seeking to serve as an environmental leader, Walmart announced a Sustainability Index in 2009 to grade suppliers and products on a range of environmental and sustainable factors.
