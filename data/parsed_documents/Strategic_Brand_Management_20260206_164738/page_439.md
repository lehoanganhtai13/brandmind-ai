### Provide Feedback Benefits to the Parent Brand

Besides facilitating acceptance of new products, brand extensions can also provide positive feedback to the parent brand in a number of ways.

**Clarify Brand Meaning.** Extensions can help clarify the meaning of a brand to consumers and define the kinds of markets in which it competes, an important first step in the brand architecture process. Thus, through brand extensions, Hunt’s means “tomato,” Clairol means “hair coloring,” Gerber means “baby care,” and Nabisco means “baked cookies and crackers.” Figure 12-3 shows how other brands that have introduced multiple brand extensions have broadened their meaning to consumers.

As Chapter 11 noted, broader brand meaning often is necessary so that firms avoid “marketing myopia” and do not mistakenly draw narrow boundaries around their brand, either missing market opportunities or becoming vulnerable to well-planned competitive strategies. Thus, as Harvard’s Ted Levitt pointed out in a pioneering article, railroads are not just in the “railroad” business but are also in the “transportation” business.¹⁶

Thinking more broadly about product meaning can easily inspire different marketing programs and new-product opportunities. For example, when Steelcase introduced the slogan, “A Smarter Way to Work,” it reflected the fact that the company had defined its business not as manufacturing desks, chairs, file cabinets, and credenzas but as “helping to enhance office productivity.” For some brands, creating broader meaning is critical and may be the only way to expand sales.

This table illustrates brand extension strategies, detailing how established brands leverage their equity to introduce new products. It presents four examples: Weight Watchers, originally known for fitness centers, extended into low-calorie foods to reinforce its brand meaning of weight loss and maintenance. Sunkist, a brand associated with oranges, expanded into vitamins and juices, broadening its meaning to encompass good health. Kellogg's, a cereal manufacturer, introduced Nutri-Grain and Special K bars, shifting its brand meaning towards healthy snacking. Finally, Aunt Jemima, known for pancake mixes, diversified into syrups and frozen waffles, solidifying its brand meaning around breakfast foods. The structure is comparative, showcasing different brands and their respective original products, extension products, and the resulting new brand meanings. In some cases, it is advantageous to establish a portfolio of related products that completely satisfy consumer needs in a certain area.
