Newspapers, however, are more timely and pervasive. Daily newspapers are read by 30 percent of the population—although that number has been declining for years as more consumers go online to get their news—and tend to be used for local (especially retailer) advertising.¹ On the other hand, although advertisers have some flexibility in designing and placing newspaper ads, poor reproduction quality and short shelf life can diminish some of the possible impact of newspaper advertising. These are disadvantages that magazine advertising usually doesn’t share.

Although print advertising is particularly well suited to communicate product information, it can also effectively communicate user and usage imagery. Fashion brands such as Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and Guess have also created strong nonproduct associations through print advertising. Some brands attempt to communicate both product benefits and user or usage imagery in their print advertising, for example, car makers such as Ford, Volkswagen, and Volvo or cosmetics makers such as Maybelline and Revlon.

One of the longest-running and perhaps most successful print ad campaigns ever is for Absolut vodka.²

## ABSOLUT

In 1980, Absolut was a tiny brand, selling 100,000, nine-liter cases a year. Research pointed out a number of liabilities for the brand: the name was seen as too gimmicky; the bottle shape was ugly, and bartenders found it hard to pour; shelf prominence was limited; and there was no credibility for a vodka brand made in Sweden. Michel Roux, president of Carillon (Absolut’s importer), and TBWA (Absolut’s New York ad agency) decided to use the oddities of the brand—its quirky name and bottle shape—to create brand personality and communicate quality and style in a series of creative print ads. Each ad in the campaign visually depicted the product in an unusual fashion and verbally reinforced the image with a simple, two-word headline using the brand name and some other word in a clever play on words. For example, the first ad showed the bottle prominently displayed, crowned by an angel’s halo, with the headline “Absolut Perfection” appearing at the bottom of the page. Follow-up ads explored various themes (seasonal, geographic, celebrity artists) but always attempted to put forth a fashionable, sophisticated, and contemporary image.

By 2001, Absolut had become the leading imported vodka in the United States, and by 2006, it was the third-largest premium spirits brand in the world, with sales of 9.8 million nine-liter cases. Facing slowing sales in 2007, however, the firm launched its first new campaign in 25 years, “In an Absolut World.” The goal of the campaign was to focus on the uniqueness of the brand by showing a fantasy world where lying leaders are exposed by their Pinocchio noses, protesters and the police wage street fights with feather pillows, nice Manhattan apartments cost $300 a month, and it takes only one lap in a pool to turn fat into muscle. Later ads expanded the meaning of an “Absolut World” to include special, offbeat, or unusual events, people, and things by including celebrities such as Kate Beckinsale and Zooey Deschanel. In 2011, a new multimedia campaign, ABSOLUT BLANK, was launched with the tag line, “It All Starts with an Absolute Blank.” Twenty artists—from drawing, painting, and sculpting to film making and digital art—used the iconic Absolut bottle as a blank canvas and creatively filled it with their artistic expression.

**Guidelines.** What makes an effective print ad? The evaluation criteria we noted earlier for television advertising apply, but print advertising has some special requirements and rules. For example, research on print ads in magazines reveals that it is not uncommon for two-thirds of a magazine audience to not even notice any one particular print ad, or for only 10 percent or so of the audience to read much of the copy of any one ad.
