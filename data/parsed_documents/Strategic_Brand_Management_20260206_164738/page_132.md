alternatively, the same level of effectiveness can be achieved at a lower cost because ads are more memorable, sales calls more productive, and so on. When combined, these five outcomes lead to brand profitability, the sixth outcome.

The ability of the brand value created at this stage to reach the final stage in terms of stock market valuation again depends on external factors, this time according to the investor sentiment multiplier.

### Investor Sentiment Multiplier.  
Financial analysts and investors consider a host of factors in arriving at their brand valuations and investment decisions. Among them are the following:

* *Market dynamics:* What are the dynamics of the financial markets as a whole (interest rates, investor sentiment, supply of capital)?
* *Growth potential:* What is the growth potential or prospects for the brand and the industry in which it operates? For example, how helpful are the facilitating factors and how inhibiting are the hindering external factors that make up the firm’s economic, social, physical, and legal environment?
* *Risk profile:* What is the risk profile for the brand? How vulnerable is the brand to those facilitating and inhibiting factors?
* *Brand contribution:* How important is the brand to the firm’s brand portfolio?

The value the brand creates in the marketplace is most likely fully reflected in shareholder value when the firm is operating in a healthy industry without serious environmental hindrances or barriers, and when the brand contributes a significant portion of the firm’s revenues and appears to have bright prospects.

The obvious examples of brands that benefited from a strong market multiplier—at least for a while—were the numerous dot-com brands at the turn of the century, such as Pets.com, eToys, Boo.com, and Webvan. The huge premium placed on their (actually negative) market performance, however, quickly disappeared—and in some cases so did the whole company!

On the other hand, many firms have lamented what they perceive as undervaluation by the market. For example, repositioned companies such as Corning have found it difficult to realize what they viewed as their true market value due to lingering investor perceptions from their past. Corning’s heritage was in dishes and cookware; its more recent emphasis is on telecommunications, flat panel displays, and the environmental, life sciences, and semiconductor industries.

### Shareholder Value.  
Based on all available current and forecasted information about a brand, as well as many other considerations, the financial marketplace formulates opinions and assessments that have very direct financial implications for the brand value. Three particularly important indicators are the stock price, the price/earnings multiple, and overall market capitalization for the firm. Research has shown that not only can strong brands deliver greater returns to stockholders, they can do so with less risk.<sup>45</sup>

### Implications  
According to the brand value chain, marketers create value first by making shrewd investments in their marketing program and then by maximizing, as much as possible, the program, customer, and market multipliers that translate that investment into bottom-line financial benefits. The brand value chain thus provides a structured means for managers to understand where and how value is created and where to look to improve that process. Certain stages will be of greater interest to different members of the organization.

Brand and category marketing managers are likely to be interested in the customer mindset and the impact of the marketing program on customers. Chief marketing officers (CMOs), on the other hand, are likely to be more interested in market performance and the impact of customer mind-set on actual market behaviors. Finally, a managing director or CEO is likely to focus on shareholder value and the impact of market performance on investment decisions.

The brand value chain has a number of implications. First, value creation begins with the marketing program investment. Therefore, a necessary—but not sufficient—condition for value creation is a well-funded, well-designed, and well-implemented marketing program. It is rare that marketers can get something for nothing.
