**Critique.**  
The main advantage of a brand-based comparative approach is that because it holds all aspects of the marketing program fixed for the brand, it isolates the value of a brand in a very real sense. Understanding exactly how knowledge of the brand affects consumer responses to prices, advertising, and so forth is extremely useful in developing strategies in these different areas. At the same time, we could study an almost infinite variety of marketing activities, so what we learn is limited only by the number of different applications we examine.

Brand-based comparative methods are particularly applicable when the marketing activity under consideration represents a change from past marketing of the brand, for example, a new sales or trade promotion, ad campaign, or proposed brand extension. If the marketing activity under consideration is already strongly identified with the brand––like an ad campaign that has been running for years––it may be difficult to attribute some aspect of the marketing program to a fictitiously named or unnamed version of the product or service in a believable fashion.

Thus, a crucial consideration with the brand-based comparative approach is the realism we can achieve in the experiment. We usually have to sacrifice some realism in order to gain sufficient control to isolate the effects of brand knowledge. When it is too difficult for consumers to examine or experience some element of the marketing program without being aware of the brand, we can use detailed concept statements of that element instead. For example, we can ask consumers to judge a proposed new product when it is either introduced by the firm as a brand extension or introduced by an unnamed firm in that product market. Similarly, we can ask about acceptable price ranges and store locations for the brand name product or a hypothetical unnamed version.

One concern about brand-based comparative approaches is that the simulations and concept statements may highlight the particular product characteristics enough to make them more salient than they would otherwise be, distorting the results.

### Marketing-Based Comparative Approaches  
Marketing-based comparative approaches hold the brand fixed and examine consumer response based on changes in the marketing program.
