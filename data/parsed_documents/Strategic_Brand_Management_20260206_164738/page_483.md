# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 13-1

## Brand Flashbacks

Older, heritage brands can reach into their past in different ways to develop successful new marketing campaigns. One way is to revisit well-known and loved past ad campaigns, perhaps giving them a twist and updating them in the process.

Dubbed **retro-branding** or *retro-advertising* by some marketing pundits, the tactic is a means to tie in with past advertising that was, and perhaps could still be, a key source of brand equity. Demonstrating the latent value of past advertising is the return of such advertising icons as Colonel Sanders for KFC, who reappeared in new advertising and packaging focused on the restaurant’s Southern roots, albeit with a thinner face and a red apron instead of the classic three-piece suit.

Retro-branding can activate and strengthen brand associations that would be virtually impossible to recreate with new advertising today. In some cases, a key point-of-difference for the brand may just turn out to be heritage or nostalgia rather than any product-related difference. Heritage can be a powerful point-of-difference—at least as long as it conveys expertise, longevity, and experience and not just age!

Anniversaries and milestones of longevity can be excellent opportunities to launch a campaign to celebrate. Marketers should focus as much on the future of the brand as on its past, of course, perhaps emphasizing how all that the brand has gone through will benefit its customers in the future. L.L. Bean’s 100th anniversary celebration in 2012 was intended to do just that. The main thrust of the campaign was to celebrate exploring the outdoors. To generate interest, the company engaged in a number of activities:

* It introduced a special-edition boot that closely replicated the first pair sold by founder Leon Leonwood Bean as well as other limited-edition offerings, including a $7,500 wooden canoe, a $149 Soule Coastal Duck Call, and a 20-gauge shotgun for $15,000.
* L.L. Bean’s Outdoor Discovery School guides traveled the country with the larger-than-life L.L. Bean Bootmobile to encourage people to get out of their homes and get back to nature.

## Protecting Sources of Brand Equity

Consistency thus guides strategic direction and does not necessarily prescribe the particular tactics of the supporting marketing program for the brand at any one point in time. Unless some change in either consumer behavior, competition, or the company makes the strategic positioning of the brand less powerful, there is likely little need to deviate from a successful positioning.

Although brands should always look for potentially powerful new sources of brand equity, a top priority is to preserve and defend those that already exist, as illustrated by this classic episode with Intel.

### INTEL

While the launch of the “Intel Inside” program in the early 1990s is a classic example of how to successfully introduce an ingredient brand, Intel did also encounter a public relations disaster with the “floating decimal” problem found by a Virginia researcher in its Pentium microprocessors in 1994. Although a flaw in the chip at the time resulted in miscalculations only in extremely unusual and exceedingly rare * The company committed up to a million dollars in a year-long partnership with the National Park Foundation.
