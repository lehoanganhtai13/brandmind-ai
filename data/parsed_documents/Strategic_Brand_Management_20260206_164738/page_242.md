For over 20 years, Colgate-Palmolive has sponsored the Starlight Children’s Foundation, which grants wishes to young people who are critically ill.

* To entertain key clients or reward key employees: Many events have lavish hospitality tents and other special services or activities that are available only for sponsors and their guests. Bank of Boston’s sponsorship of musical performances and Bank of America’s golf tournament sponsorship include special events for clients. Involving clients with the event in these and other ways can engender goodwill and establish valuable business contacts. From an employee perspective, events can build participation and morale or create an incentive.

* To permit merchandising or promotional opportunities: Many marketers tie in contests or sweepstakes, in-store merchandising, and direct response or other marketing activities with their event. Warner-Lambert sponsors the “Taste of Chicago” promotion in part so it can gain shelf space in stores and participate in retailer co-op advertising.

Despite these potential advantages, there are a number of potential disadvantages to sponsorship. The success of an event can be unpredictable and out of the sponsor’s control. There can be much clutter in sponsorship. Finally, although many consumers will credit sponsors for providing necessary financial assistance to make an event possible, some consumers may still resent the commercialization of events through sponsorship.

**Guidelines.** Developing successful event sponsorship means choosing the appropriate events, designing the optimal sponsorship program, and measuring the effects of sponsorship on brand equity.

**Choosing Sponsorship Opportunities.** Because of the huge amount of money involved and the number of event opportunities, many marketers are thinking more strategically about the events with which they will get involved and the manner by which they will do so.

There are a number of potential guidelines for choosing events. First, the event must meet the marketing objectives and communication strategy defined for the brand. That is, the audience delivered by the event must match the target market of the brand. Moreover, the event must have sufficient awareness, possess the desired image, and be capable of creating the desired effects with that target market. Of particular concern is whether consumers make favorable attributions to the sponsor for its participation.

An “ideal event” might be one whose audience closely matches the ideal target market, that generates much favorable attention, that is unique but not encumbered with many sponsors, that lends itself to ancillary marketing activities, and that reflects or even enhances the brand or corporate image of the sponsor.

Of course, rather than linking themselves to an event, some sponsors create their own. Branding Brief 6-1 describes how cable sports network ESPN created the X Games to appeal to a market segment not easily attracted by traditional sports.

More and more firms are also using their names to sponsor the arenas, stadiums, and other venues that actually hold the events. Staples paid $100 million over 20 years to name the downtown Los Angeles arena where the NBA Lakers and Clippers and the NHL Kings play, and where concerts and other events are also held. Although stadium naming rights can command high fees, its direct contribution to building brand equity is primarily in creating brand recognition—not brand recall—and marketers can expect it to do little for brand image except perhaps to convey a certain level of scope and size.

**Designing Sponsorship Programs.** Many marketers believe that the marketing program accompanying a sponsorship is what ultimately determines its success. A sponsor can strategically identify itself at an event in a number of ways, including banners, signs, and programs. For more significant and broader impact, however, sponsors typically supplement such activities with samples, prizes, advertising, retail promotions, publicity, and so forth. Marketers often note that the budget for related marketing activities should be at least two to three times the amount of the sponsorship expenditure.
