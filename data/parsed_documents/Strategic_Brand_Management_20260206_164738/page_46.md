# People and Organizations

These often have well-defined images that are easily understood and liked (or disliked) by others. That’s particularly true for public figures such as politicians, entertainers, and professional athletes. All these compete in some sense for public approval and acceptance, and all benefit from conveying a strong and desirable image.

## NIGELLA LAWSON

Nigella Lawson is not a typical celebrity chef. She has no formal training, has never operated a restaurant, and is self-admittedly lazy. In fact, her first cookbook opens with the warning that she isn’t a chef, she has never been trained as one, and her only license comes from a love of eating. Yet Lawson has been able to transform characteristics otherwise regarded as limitations into a brand spanning a series of award-winning books, a string of popular BBC television series, a cookware line, and even an iPhone app. Lawson’s connection with consumers stems from sharing their frustrations and anxieties about cooking. A former food critic, Lawson was inspired to write her first book when she witnessed the host of a dinner party bursting into tears over a spoiled crème caramel. Instead of challenging her fans to create ever more complicated recipes, Lawson strives to offer pragmatic but tasty recipes that reduce rather than add stress. Whether deliberate or not, her perceived sense of empathy with the common cook has earned her a loyal following.⁽²⁴⁾

That’s not to say that only the well-known or famous can be thought of as a brand. Certainly, one key for a successful career in almost any area is that co-workers, superiors, or even important people outside your company or organization know who you are and recognize your skills, talents, attitude, and so forth. By building up a name and reputation in a business context, you are essentially creating your own brand.⁽²⁵⁾ The right awareness and image can be invaluable in shaping the way people treat you and interpret your words, actions, and deeds.⁽²⁶⁾

Similarly, organizations often take on meanings through their programs, activities, and products. Nonprofit organizations such as the Sierra Club, the American Red Cross, and Amnesty International have increasingly emphasized marketing. The children’s advocate nonprofit UNICEF has initiated a number of marketing activities and programs through the years.
