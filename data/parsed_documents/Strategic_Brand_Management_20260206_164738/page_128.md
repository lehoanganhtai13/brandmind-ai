The ad ended with the tagline, “There Are Some Things Money Can’t Buy; For Everything Else There’s MasterCard” and “Accepted At Ballparks Coast-to-Coast.” The ads reinforced the notion that the ultimate goal of MasterCard—a feeling, an accomplishment, or other intangible—was truly “priceless.” The campaign has been so successful that it has run around the world, with appropriate cultural adaptation. The baseball spot, for example, was redone as a cricket ad for Australia. The campaign has received many awards, including four EFFIES from the American Marketing Association for effectiveness.42

**Brands Should Have Richness.** The level of detail in the brand resonance model highlights the number of possible ways to create meaning with consumers and the range of possible avenues to elicit consumer responses. Collectively, these various aspects of brand meaning and the resulting responses produce strong consumer bonds to the brand. The various associations making up the brand image may be reinforcing, helping strengthen or increase the favorability of other brand associations, or they may be unique, helping add distinctiveness or offset some potential deficiencies. Strong brands thus have both breadth (in terms of duality) *and* depth (in terms of richness).

*At the same time, brands should not necessarily be expected to score highly on all the various dimensions and categories making up each core brand value.* Building blocks can have hierarchies in their own right. For example, with respect to brand awareness, typically marketers should first establish category identification in some way before considering strategies to expand brand breadth via needs satisfied or benefits offered. With brand performance, they may wish to first link primary characteristics and related features before attempting to link additional, more peripheral associations.

Similarly, brand imagery often begins with a fairly concrete initial articulation of user and usage imagery that, over time, leads to broader, more abstract brand associations of personality, value, history, heritage, and experience. Brand judgments usually begin with positive quality and credibility perceptions that can lead to brand consideration and then perhaps ultimately to assessments of brand superiority. Brand feelings usually start with either experiential ones (warmth, fun, and excitement) or inward ones (security, social approval, and self-respect.) Finally, resonance again has a clear ordering, whereby behavioral loyalty is a starting point, but attitudinal attachment or a sense of community is almost always needed for active engagement to occur.

**Brand Resonance Provides Important Focus.** As Figure 3-1 shows, brand resonance is the pinnacle of the brand resonance model and provides important focus and priority for decision making about marketing. Marketers building brands should use brand resonance as a goal and a means to interpret their brand-related marketing activities. The question to ask is, To what extent is marketing activity affecting the key dimensions of brand resonance—consumer loyalty, attachment, community, or engagement with the brand? Is marketing activity creating brand performance and imagery associations and consumer judgments and feelings that will support these brand resonance dimensions?

### SHUTTERFLY

A brand that has explicitly considered how to build brand resonance is Shutterfly. Although known in particular for its online photographic services, Shutterfly defines itself more broadly as an “Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service” that “provides high-quality products and world-class services that make it easy, convenient and fun for consumers to preserve their digital photos in a creative and thoughtful manner.” In a highly competitive marketplace, Shutterfly’s flagship product, Photo Book, allows customers to create custom photo books in professionally bound coffee table form. The company’s brand objective is to be a “Trusted Partner.” To further that goal and to help create a strong personal connection with its users, brand marketing emphasizes social influence and being smart and fun. Shutterfly also offers social media services that allow users to share photos uploaded on their site with blogs and social networks like Facebook and Twitter.43

It is virtually impossible, however, for consumers to experience an intense, active loyalty relationship with *all* the brands they purchase and consume. Thus, some brands will be more meaningful to consumers than others, because of the nature of their associated product or service, the characteristics of the consumer, and so on.
