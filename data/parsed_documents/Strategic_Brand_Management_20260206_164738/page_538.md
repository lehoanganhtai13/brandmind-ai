The company also has been trying to identify product groups that may be more amenable to localizing than others. For example, movies cannot be tailored for the European market because it is difficult to determine what will be attractive to those consumers. On the other hand, certain items may sell well in Germany but not in Japan.

Finally, for all this planning to work, there must be effective lines of communication. Coca-Cola stresses the importance of having people on the ground who can effectively manage the brand in concert with headquarters in Atlanta. To facilitate coordination, much training occurs at company headquarters; a sophisticated communication system is in place; and global databases are available. The goal of this heavily integrated information system is to facilitate the local manager’s ability to tap into what constitutes “relevance” in any particular country and then communicate those ideals to headquarters.

### 9. Implement a Global Brand Equity Measurement System

As the guidelines in Chapter 8 suggest, a global brand equity measurement system is a set of research procedures designed to provide timely, accurate, and actionable information for marketers on brands, so they can make the best possible tactical decisions in the short run and strategic decisions in the long run in all relevant markets. As part of this system, a global brand equity management system defines the brand equity charter in a global context, outlining how to interpret the brand positioning and resulting marketing program in different markets, as suggested by the previous global branding commandment. With the global brand strategy template in place, brand tracking can assess progress, especially in terms of creating the desired positioning, eliciting the proper responses, and developing brand resonance.

#### LEVI STRAUSS

Levi Strauss & Co. continually monitors its brand equity among consumers in most of its key markets around the world. The company developed “Brand Value Propositions” for each of its major brands. These are a set of enduring strategies that define each brand and differentiate it from competition. They succinctly list the brand’s global positioning (including frame of reference and point-of-difference), its global character, and its global “building blocks” or desired state regarding consumer wants and needs. The Brand Value Propositions drive all brand strategies and actions and provide a globally consistent platform for regionally relevant product and marketing execution. In tracking each brand’s equity, via ongoing consumer surveys, Levi Strauss & Co. monitors the consumer’s perceptions and interactions with its brands; the impact its clothes, retail distribution, marketing, and other touchpoints are having on consumers; and whether the results of its efforts are in line with its Brand Value Propositions. Through these efforts, Levi Strauss & Co. is able to tailor brand strategies to ensure each brand is meeting consumer needs while being true to its essence.

The challenge is that the marketing research infrastructure may be lacking in many countries. When DuPont set out to implement a global tracking system for its various brands, its efforts were hampered by a level of sophistication among local marketing research companies that varied considerably for the 40 primary countries in which it operated. Now marketing research firms are creating global networks of companies that help overcome this problem.

### 10. Leverage Brand Elements

Proper design and implementation of brand elements can often be critical to the successful building of global brand equity. As Figure 4-2 showed, a number of brands have encountered resistance because of difficulty in translating their name, packaging, slogans, or other brand elements to another culture. The Science of Branding 14-1 describes some cultural differences in brand name memorability and recall.

In general, nonverbal brand elements such as logos, symbols, and characters are more likely to directly transfer well—at least as long as their meaning is visually clear—than verbal brand elements that may need to be translated into another language. Nonverbal brand elements are Given the linguistic differences between cultures whose languages do not share a common root, perhaps it is not surprising that some brand names are more likely to be recalled in one culture than another.
