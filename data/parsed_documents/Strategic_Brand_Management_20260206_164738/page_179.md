How can marketers integrate these activities to enhance brand awareness, improve the brand image, elicit positive brand responses, and increase brand resonance?

Our focus is on designing marketing activities from a branding perspective. We’ll consider how the brand itself can be effectively integrated into the marketing program to create brand equity. Of necessity, we leave a broader perspective on marketing activities to basic marketing management texts.[^1] We begin by considering some key developments in designing marketing programs. After reviewing product, pricing, and channel strategies, we conclude by considering private labels in Brand Focus 5.0.

## NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MARKETING

The strategy and tactics behind marketing programs have changed dramatically in recent years as firms have dealt with enormous shifts in their external marketing environments. As outlined in Chapter 1, changes in the economic, technological, political–legal, sociocultural, and competitive environments have forced marketers to embrace new approaches and philosophies. Some of these changes include:[^2]

* Rapid technological developments  
* Greater customer empowerment  
* Fragmentation of traditional media  
* Growth of interactive and mobile marketing options  
* Channel transformation and disintermediation  
* Increased competition and industry convergence  
* Globalization and growth of developing markets  
* Heightened environmental, community, and social concerns  
* Severe economic recession  

These changes, and others such as privatization and regulation, have combined to give customers and companies new capabilities with a number of implications for the practice of brand management (see Figure 5-1). Marketers are increasingly abandoning the mass-market strategies that built brand powerhouses in the twentieth century to implement new approaches for a new marketing era. Even marketers in staid, traditional categories and industries are rethinking their practices and not doing business as usual.

Figure 5-1 outlines the new capabilities afforded by the "New Economy" to both consumers and companies. Consumers gain enhanced power through increased access to a wider variety of goods and services, extensive information, and improved interaction channels with both marketers and other consumers for comparison and feedback. Companies, in turn, benefit from a new information and sales channel with expanded geographic reach, enabling them to gather richer market intelligence and engage in two-way communication with customers. This facilitates greater transaction efficiency, personalized offerings, and targeted marketing through permission-based e-mail. Furthermore, companies can leverage these capabilities to improve internal operations, including purchasing, recruiting, training, and communication. The structure is comparative, highlighting the distinct yet interconnected advantages for each economic actor. Started in 1990 by avid cyclist Gary Erickson and named to honor his father, CLIF® Bar set out to offer a better-tasting energy bar with wholesome ingredients.
