## Redefine the Relationship.

Finally, another potentially powerful but often difficult way to address the negative relationship between attributes and benefits in the minds of consumers is to convince them that in fact the relationship is positive. Marketers can achieve this by providing consumers with a different perspective and suggesting that they may be overlooking or ignoring certain factors or other considerations. Apple offers another classic example.

### APPLE

When Apple launched the Macintosh computer in the 1980s—back in the early days of personal computing—its key point-of-difference was “user friendly.” Many consumers valued ease of use—especially those who bought personal computers for the home—because in a pre-Windows world, the DOS PC operating system was complex and clumsy. One drawback with that association for Apple, however, was that customers who bought personal computers for business applications inferred that if a personal computer was easy to use, then it also must not be very powerful—and power was a key choice consideration in the business market. Recognizing this potential problem, Apple ran a clever ad campaign with the tag line “The Power to Be Your Best,” in an attempt to redefine what being a powerful computer meant. The message behind the ads was that because Apple was easy to use, people in fact did just that—they used them!—a simple but important indication of “power.” In other words, the most powerful computers were ones that people actually used.

Although difficult to achieve, such a strategy can be powerful because the two associations can become mutually reinforcing. The challenge is to develop a credible story with which consumers can agree.

### Straddle Positions

Occasionally, a company will be able to straddle two frames of reference with one set of points-of-difference and points-of-parity. In these cases, the points-of-difference in one category become points-of-parity in the other and vice-versa for points-of-parity. For example, Accenture defines itself as the company that combines (1) strategic insight, vision, and thought leadership and (2) information technology expertise in developing client solutions. This strategy permits points-of-parity with its two main competitors, McKinsey and IBM, while simultaneously achieving points-of-difference. Specifically, Accenture has a point-of-difference on technology and execution with respect to McKinsey and a point-of-parity on strategy and vision. The reverse is true with respect to IBM: technology and execution are points-of-parity, but strategy and vision are points-of-difference. Another brand that has successfully employed a straddle positioning is BMW.
