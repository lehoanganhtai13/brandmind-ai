# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 4-2

## Balance Creative and Strategic Thinking to Create Great Characters

Great characters, the Pillsbury Doughboy, for example, can embody a brand’s story and spark enthusiasm for it. But bringing a character to life through advertising requires navigating a host of pitfalls. Character, a company based in Portland, Oregon, helps create new corporate brand characters and revitalize old ones.

During three-day “Character” camps, a team from a client company learns to flesh out a new or current brand character through improvisational acting, discussion, and reflection. According to Character president David Altschul, brand characters are unique in that they straddle the worlds of marketing and entertainment. Their function is to represent a brand, but they compete for attention with other characters to which consumers are exposed through television, movies, video games, and novels. Altschul emphasizes maintaining consistency across all communications and familiarizing all employees with the story behind the brand. The results of Character Camps are intended to equip creative directors with background and insights into the company’s character that can spur new ideas and approaches.

These are some tips for brand characters presented at Character Camps.

1. **Don’t be a shill.** Human traits are appealing. M&M’s were successful in giving the brand more appeal once the M&M characters were given more human traits.  
2. **Create a life.** Create a full backstory to fill out the character. This ensures that the character can evolve over time and continue to connect with consumers.  
3. **Make characters vulnerable.** Even superheroes have flaws. Maytag launched a new character, the Apprentice, to complement its famous lonely repairman.  
4. **Imagine the long run.** Characters like General Mills’s Jolly Green Giant have been around for decades. Don’t get rid of older characters just to make room for new ones. Consumers can get very attached to longtime characters.  
5. **Don’t ask too much.** Characters with a simple task or purpose work best. Using characters for new lines or other purposes can dilute their effectiveness.

To be truly effective, brand characters have to be engaging in their own right while staying true to the brand. Most characters though, are conceived as short-term solutions to solve specific problems. If the audience likes a character, companies face the challenge of turning it into an asset. At this point, some companies try to freeze all the character’s attributes and preserve them. But Altschul cautions against this strategy, saying static characters can lose their appeal and fail to emotionally connect with consumers. On the other hand, characters that are mass-marketed too heavily can also crash and burn. The California Raisins met such a fate when their licensing program pushed them into every possible type of paraphernalia without much thought about their backstory.

Altschul maintains that viewers connect with characters whose struggles are familiar. He says the way to ensure that a brand character adds value for the long run is to address strategic questions such as: “What is this story about?” “What are the flaws, vulnerabilities, and sources of conflict that connect the character to the brand in a deep, intrinsic way?” “What human truth is revealed through the story that audiences can relate to?”

Altschul’s company helps clients find this intersection between story and marketing by defining the essence of a brand and the character and then clarifying the connection between the two. The brand character is profiled to bring out the personality traits, behavior, and mission that may be used for future storylines. And the participants talk about how the character should look, act, and interact with others to most effectively communicate the essence of the brand. The goal is to create guidelines for how the character may evolve and suggests ways the character could be used beyond traditional advertising media. Altschul suggests that companies also establish principles for the brand to stay “in character,” including ways the character can serve as conscience for the brand when making decisions such as line extensions, alliances, and competitive responses.

## HBO

As a pay TV channel, HBO has always needed to convince viewers it was worth paying extra money for. More than just a pay movie channel, HBO had a tradition of broadcasting original, edgy programming such as *Sex and the City*, *The Sopranos*, and *Entourage* that would not be found on free channels. To highlight its most compelling point-of-difference and brand essence, HBO developed a clever slogan in 1996:  
“It’s Not TV, It’s HBO.” Externally, the slogan gave viewers a point of reference to understand and categorize the brand. Internally, the slogan gave employees a clear vision and goal to keep in mind: No matter what they did, it should never look like ordinary TV.<sup>53</sup>
