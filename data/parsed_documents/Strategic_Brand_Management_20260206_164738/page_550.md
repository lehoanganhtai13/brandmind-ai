Although brand associations come in many forms, we can usefully distinguish between product-related or performance-related versus non-product-related or imagery-related attributes. A useful distinction with benefits is between functional (intrinsic product advantages), symbolic (extrinsic product advantages), or experiential (product consumption advantages) benefits. Some of these attribute and benefit associations may be more rational or cognitive in nature; others more emotional or affective.

### Sources of Brand Equity.  
Customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer has a high level of awareness and familiarity with the brand and holds some strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in memory. In some cases, brand awareness alone is sufficient to result in more favorable consumer response, for example, in low-involvement decision settings in which consumers lack motivation or ability and are willing to base their choices merely on familiar brands. In other cases, the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of the brand associations help determine the differential response making up the brand equity. The dimensions of brand associations depend on three factors:

1. **Strength:** The strength of a brand association is a function of both the amount, or quantity, of processing that information initially receives, and the nature, or quality, of the processing. The more deeply a person thinks about brand information and relates it to existing brand knowledge, the stronger the resulting brand associations. The personal relevance of the information and the consistency with which the consumer sees it over time both strengthen the association.

2. **Favorability:** Favorable associations for a brand are those that are desirable to customers, successfully delivered by the product, and conveyed by the supporting marketing program. They can relate to the product or to intangible, non-product-related aspects like usage or user imagery. However, consumers will not deem all brand associations important or view them all favorably, nor will they value them equally across different purchase or consumption situations.

3. **Uniqueness:** To create the differential response that leads to customer-based brand equity, marketers need to associate unique, meaningful points-of-difference to the brand that provide a competitive advantage and a “reason why” consumers should buy it. For other brand associations, however, being comparable or roughly equal in favorability to competing associations might be enough. The brand’s associations function as points-of-parity in consumers’ minds to establish category membership and negate potential points-of-difference for competitors. In other words, they are designed to provide “no reason why not” to choose the brand.

Figure 15-2 summarizes these broad conceptual guidelines for creating desired brand knowledge structures.

This table outlines key dimensions of brand knowledge, structured around two primary aspects: brand awareness and brand associations. Brand awareness is characterized by its depth, measured by the ease of brand recognition and recall, and its breadth, determined by the variety of purchase and consumption situations where the brand is considered. Brand associations are further categorized by their strength, favorability, and uniqueness. Strong associations are built through consistent marketing efforts that effectively communicate relevant information. Favorable associations arise when marketing programs deliver desired product-related and non-product-related benefits. Unique brand associations, when strong and favorable, serve as points of difference, distinguishing the brand from competitors, while non-unique associations can establish points of parity, fulfilling category requirements or counteracting competitor advantages.
