### Packaging at the Point of Purchase.

Many consumers may first encounter a new brand on the supermarket shelf or in the store. Because few product differences exist in some categories, packaging innovations can provide at least a temporary edge on competition.  
For these reasons, packaging is a particularly cost-effective way to build brand equity. It is sometimes called the “last five seconds of marketing” as well as “permanent media” or “the last salesman.” Walmart looks at packaging critically and tests whether consumers understand the brand promise behind the package within three seconds and up to 15 feet from the shelf. Note that consumer exposure to packaging is not restricted to the point of purchase and moments of consumption, because brand packages often can play a starring role in advertising.

### Packaging Innovations.

Packaging innovations can both lower costs and/or improve demand. One important supply-side goal for many firms is to redesign packages and employ more recyclable materials to lower the use of paper and plastic. Toward that goal, U.S. food, beverage, and consumer product manufacturers reported that they had eliminated 1.5 billion pounds of packaging between 2005 and 2011 with another 2.5 billion pounds expected to be avoided by 2020, representing an overall reduction of 19 percent in total average U.S. packaging weight.  
On the demand side, in mature markets especially, package innovations can provide a short-term sales boost. The beverage industry in general has been characterized by a number of packaging innovations. For example, following the lead of Snapple’s wide-mouth glass bottle, Arizona iced teas and fruit drinks in oversize (24-ounce), pastel-colored cans with a southwestern motif became a $300 million brand in a few years with no marketing support beyond point-of-purchase and rudimentary outdoor ads, designed in-house.

### Package Design.

An integral part of product development and launch, package design has become a more sophisticated process. In the past, it was often an afterthought, and colors, materials, and so forth were often chosen fairly arbitrarily. For example, legend has it that Campbell’s famous soup is red and white because one executive at the company liked the uniforms of Cornell University’s football team!  
These days, specialized package designers bring artistic techniques and scientific skills to package design in an attempt to meet the marketing objectives for a brand. These consultants conduct detailed analyses to break down the package into a number of different elements. They decide on the optimal look and content of each element and choose which elements should be dominant in any one package—whether the brand name, illustration, or some other graphical element—and how the elements should relate to each other. Designers can also decide which elements should be shared across packages and which should differ (and how).  
Designers often refer to the “shelf impact” of a package—the visual effect the package has at the point of the purchase when consumers see it in the context of other packages in the category. For example, “bigger and brighter” packages are not always better when competitors’ packages are also factored in. Given enough shelf space, however, manufacturers can create billboard effects with their brand to raise their prominence and impact. General Mill deliberately “tiled” graphical elements of their packaging so that some of their mega-brands with multiple varieties such as Cheerios, Nature Valley Granola Bars, and Progresso Soup would stand out.  
Although packaging is subject to some legal requirements, such as nutrition information on food products, there is plenty of scope for improving brand awareness and forming brand associations. Perhaps one of the most important visual design elements for a package is its color. Some package designers believe that consumers have a “color vocabulary” when it comes to products and expect certain types of products to have a particular look.  
For example, it would be difficult to sell milk in anything but a white carton, club soda in anything but a blue package, and so forth. At the same time, certain brands are thought to have “color ownership” such that it would be difficult for other brands to use a similar look. Here is how some experts see the brand color palette:  

- **Red:** Ritz crackers, Folgers coffee, Colgate toothpaste, Target retailer, and Coca-Cola soft drinks  
- **Orange:** Tide laundry detergent, Wheaties cereal, Home Depot retailer, and Stouffer’s frozen dinners **Yellow:** Kodak film, Juicy Fruit chewing gum, McDonald’s restaurants, IKEA retailers, Cheerios cereal, Lipton tea, and Bisquick biscuit mix
