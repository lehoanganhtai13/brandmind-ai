## ESPN Brand Hierarchy

This table outlines ESPN's consumer product offerings across various media platforms, demonstrating a multi-channel distribution strategy. The core product, "ESPN The Magazine," is presented with its Spanish language versions, "ESPN La Revisita" and "Revisita ESPN," alongside related print products like "ESPN Books." The "Online" column details a comprehensive digital presence, including the main ESPN website, specialized sports sites (e.g., ESPNDeportes.com, ESPNCricinfo.com), radio platforms (ESPNRadio.com, ESPN Deportes Radio), and mobile services. The "Television" column lists numerous ESPN-branded television channels, indicating a significant broadcast component. Finally, "Interactive" media includes physical locations such as "ESPN Zone" and "ESPN Wide World Sports Complex," suggesting experiential offerings. The structure highlights how a central brand extends into diverse content formats and engagement channels.

ESPN Brand Hierarchy

> For legal reasons, the company or corporate brand is almost always present somewhere on the product or package, although the name of a company subsidiary may appear instead of the corporate name. For example, Fortune Brands owns many different companies, such as Jim Beam whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Master Lock locks, and Moen faucets, but it does not use its corporate name on any of its lines of business.  
> For some firms like General Electric and Hewlett-Packard, the corporate brand is virtually the only brand. Conglomerate Siemens’s varied electrical engineering and electronics business units are branded with descriptive modifiers, such as Siemens Transportation Systems. In other cases, the company name is virtually invisible and, although technically part of the hierarchy, receives virtually no attention in the marketing program. Black & Decker does not use its name on its high-end DeWalt professional power tools.  
> As we detail below, we can think of a *corporate image* as the consumer associations to the company or corporation making the product or providing the service. Corporate image is particularly relevant when the corporate or company brand plays a prominent role in the branding strategy.

### Family Brand Level

At the next-lower level, a *family brand*, also called a *range brand* or *umbrella brand*, is used in more than one product category but is not necessarily the name of the company or corporation. For example, ConAgra’s Healthy Choice family brand appears on a wide spectrum of food products, including packaged meats, soups, pasta sauces, breads, popcorn, and ice cream. Some other notable family brands for companies that generate more than $1 billion in sales include Purina and Kit Kat (Nestlé); Mountain Dew, Doritos, and Quaker Foods (PepsiCo); and Oreo, Cadbury, and Maxwell House (Kraft).  
Because a family brand may be distinct from the corporate or company brand, company-level associations may be less salient. Most firms typically support only a handful of family brands. If the corporate brand is applied to a range of products, then it functions as a family brand too, and the two levels collapse to one for those products.  
Marketers may apply family brands instead of corporate brands for several reasons. As products become more dissimilar, it may be harder for the corporate brand to retain any product meaning or to effectively link the disparate products. Distinct family brands, on the other hand, can evoke a specific set of associations across a group of related products.<sup>15</sup> Family brands thus can be an efficient means to link common associations to multiple but distinct products.
