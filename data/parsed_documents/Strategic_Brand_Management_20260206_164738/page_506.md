The spokesperson for the ad was Dr. Thomas N. Gates, the company’s medical director, whose deep, reassuring voice exuded confidence and control. Looking calmly straight into the camera, he stated:

> You’re all aware of the recent tragic events in which Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules were criminally tampered with in limited areas after they left our factories. This act damages all of us—you the American public because you have made Tylenol a trusted part of your healthcare and we who make Tylenol because we’ve worked hard to earn that trust. We will now work even harder to keep it. We have voluntarily withdrawn all Tylenol capsules from the shelf. We will reintroduce capsules in tamper-resistant containers as quickly as possible. Until then, we urge all Tylenol capsule users to use the tablet form and we have offered to replace your capsules with tablets. Tylenol has had the trust of the medical profession and 100 million Americans for over 20 years. We value that trust too much to let any individual tamper with it. We want you to continue to trust Tylenol.

The heavy media schedule for this ad ensured that 85 percent of the market viewed it at least four times during this week.

On November 11, 1982, six weeks after the poisonings and after intense behind-the-scenes activity, the chairman of J&J held a live teleconference with 600 news reporters throughout the United States to announce the return of Tylenol capsules to the market in a new, triple-sealed package that was regarded as virtually tamperproof. To get consumers to try the new packaging, the company undertook the largest program of couponing in commercial history.

On November 28, 1982, 60 million coupons offering a free Tylenol product (valued up to $2.50) were distributed in Sunday newspapers nationwide. Twenty million more coupons were distributed the following Sunday. By the end of December, 30 percent of the coupons had been redeemed. J&J also engaged in a number of activities to enlist the support of retailers in the form of trade promotions, sales calls, and so forth.

Convinced that market conditions were now stable enough to commence regular advertising, J&J’s ad agency developed three ad executions using the testimony of loyal Tylenol users with the goal of convincing consumers that they could continue to use Tylenol with confidence. The first ad execution contained excerpts of consumers’ reaction to the tampering incident, the second ad brought back a Tylenol supporter from an ad campaign run before the tampering incident to reassert her trust in Tylenol, and the third ad used the testimony of a Tylenol user who reasoned that she could still trust the product because hospitals still used it. The recall scores for two of the commercials were among the highest ever recorded by ASI, a well-known marketing research firm that conducted the ad testing for J&J. The return to advertising was accompanied by additional coupon promotional offers to consumers.

Incredibly, by February 1983, sales for Tylenol had almost fully returned to the lofty pretampering sales levels the brand had enjoyed six months earlier. Clearly, J&J’s skillful handling of an extremely difficult situation was a major factor in the brand’s comeback. Another important factor, however, was the equity of the brand and its strong and valuable “trust” association built up over the years prior to the incident. The feelings of trust the brand engendered helped speed its recovery, a fact certainly evident to J&J (note how often the word *trust* appears in the initial Gates ad—five times).

Johnson & Johnson and McNeil Consumer Healthcare’s remarkable recovery from the brink of disaster allowed the company to reap the benefits of market leadership. A $1 billion brand, Tylenol was successfully extended into cough and cold remedies, nighttime pain relievers, and children’s versions. The next-largest pain reliever competitor had only half the market share.

The tide began to turn in the 1990s, however, as the possibility of liver damage and even death from taking more than the recommended dosage of Tylenol was found. Some analysts felt J&J should have been more forthcoming about the possible product dangers in its labeling. This health issue persisted over the next two decades as research continued to uncover consumers’ lack of understanding of proper dosing and dangers of side effects. The government continued to weigh its regulatory options.

## Tylenol’s Quality Control Crises

Concerns about dosage were exacerbated by a series of disastrous quality-control scandals and problems. During 2009 to 2011, the brand came under a flood of negative publicity and harsh criticism from government regulators. Unlike the tampering incidents, these wounds were self-inflicted, and although no deaths occurred, the care, comfort, and confidence of Tylenol customers was at stake, making Johnson & Johnson’s actions—or inactions in some cases—highly troubling.

The problems seemed to arise in cutbacks in quality control and compliance at some of McNeil Consumer Healthcare’s manufacturing facilities. Cost-cutting and a change in oversight procedures let several defective products fall through the cracks, while errors in judgment after the fact only compounded the problems.

In one of the first incidents, J&J recalled two dozen varieties of its Children’s Tylenol in 2009 because of possible bacterial contamination at one of its manufacturing facilities. Additional problems emerged in the same plant the following year, and government regulators expressed their displeasure at the company’s lack of progress in dealing with the problem.

In January 2010, J&J recalled several hundred batches of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl, and St. Joseph’s Aspirin, 20 months after it reportedly first began to receive consumer complaints about moldy-smelling bottles that made some people feel ill. The FDA faulted the company for not conducting a timely, comprehensive investigation; not quickly identifying the source of the problem; and not notifying authorities of the problem, all of which prolonged consumer vulnerability.

The culprit was the breakdown of a chemical used to treat wood pallets that transported and stored product packaging in a Las Piedras, Puerto Rico facility. A few months later, in April 2010, J&J also recalled millions of bottles of Tylenol, Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Motrin because excessively high levels of an active drug, metal specks, or ingredients that had failed testing requirements led to possible safety violations. Ever-higher levels of scrutiny of the company followed, revealing that back in 2009, McNeil Consumer Healthcare had hired private contractors to buy scores of bottles of defective Motrin in a stealth recall. Because there was no actual safety risk, the company maintained that a formal recall was not necessary. Once again, federal regulators disagreed with its handling of a problem.

These unprecedented quality-control miscues cost the company $1 billion in sales and, perhaps more importantly, the trust, respect, and admiration of the public it had worked so hard to preserve back in 1982. After much criticism Not all brands have handled their crises as well as Johnson & Johnson did the tampering incident, or as poorly as it did its quality-control problems.
