### Differences in Consumer Responses to Marketing Mix Elements

Consumers in different parts of the world feel differently about marketing activity.<sup>24</sup> U.S. consumers tend to be fairly cynical toward advertising, whereas Japanese view it much more positively. Differences also exist in advertising style: Japanese ads tend to be softer and more abstract in tone, whereas U.S. ads are often richer in product information.

Price sensitivity, promotion responsiveness, sponsorship support, and other activities all may differ by country, and these differences can motivate differences in consumer behavior and decision making. In a comparative study of brand purchase intentions, U.S. consumers were twice as likely to be affected by their product beliefs and attitudes toward the brand itself, whereas Koreans were eight times more likely to be influenced by social normative beliefs and what they felt others would think about the purchase.<sup>25</sup>
