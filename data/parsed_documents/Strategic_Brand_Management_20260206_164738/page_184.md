# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 5-1

## Making Sense Out of Brand Scents

The smell of a new car is distinctive. When Rolls-Royce customers complained in the 1990s that the new cars weren’t as good as the old models, researchers tracked the problem to a surprising source: the car’s smell. The company then recreated the aroma of a 1965 Rolls and now sprays it in all the new models. So can scent be used to entice customers or to make a place a little more memorable?

Las Vegas casinos have long infused scents into gaming areas to encourage gamblers to stay a little longer. Now the connection between scent and shopping experience is being explored in more venues than ever. More and more companies looking for an edge are tinkering with scent as a way to distinguish their brand or store. The ever-growing barrage of advertising consumers take in is heavily weighted toward visuals. Although distinctive ring tones and other sounds are used to build brand awareness, most communication appeals to only one of the five human senses: sight.

Retailers are looking to capitalize on scent as a way to lure customers into their stores and into lingering longer than they otherwise might. Victoria’s Secret has long used vanilla scents in its stores, but now retailers like the Samsung Experience concept store are starting to get in on the action as a way to distinguish themselves from competitors. But experts caution that scents aren’t guaranteed to boost sales. The best scents are unobtrusive. Anything overwhelming can be a negative. And smells should appeal to the same gender the product is trying to appeal to.

Scents that are appropriate or consistent with a product can influence brand evaluations and judgments. Westin Hotels carefully developed a new fragrance, White Tea, to infuse into the hotels’ public spaces. The scent is designed to have international appeal and contribute to a subtle, relaxing vibe in the lobbies. Travelers also encounter a unique scent on Singapore Airlines through the scented towels handed out during all flights. The theory is that passengers will associate the subtle scent with a positive, relaxing experience.

Some brands have a built-in sensory marketing advantage. Crayola Crayons were not originally designed to have a signature scent, but the manufacturing process left them with a recognizable odor. Many adults connect the smell of Crayons with childhood, leaving Crayola with an incidental brand element that can be very valuable. When Crayola’s parent company was recently considering ways to stand out among the generic competition in new markets, it decided to trademark the smell. Scents have actually been shown to improve product memory across a range of product attributes.

Of course, some products are all about scent. Procter & Gamble built a $1 billion brand with Febreze air freshener. From its origins as a fabric treatment to freshen up coats, drapes, and mattresses, the brand’s product line grew to include specific sprays for cars, sportswear, pets, carpets, and allergen reduction, as well as decorative candles, scented reed diffusers, and flameless scented luminaries. Scents are available for those looking to solve a problem (such as pet odor) or to create an ambiance around the house.

Here are just a few of the basic benefits relationship marketing provides:

* Acquiring new customers can cost five times as much as satisfying and retaining current customers.
* The average company loses 10 percent of its customers each year.
* A 5 percent reduction in the customer defection rate can increase profits by 25–85 percent, depending on the industry.
* The customer profit rate tends to increase over the life of the retained customer.

We next review three concepts that can be helpful with relationship marketing: mass customization, one-to-one marketing, and permission marketing.

### Mass Customization

The concept behind mass customization, namely making products to fit the customer’s exact specifications, is an old one, but the advent of digital-age technology enables companies to offer customized products on a previously unheard-of scale. Going online, customers can communicate their preferences directly to the manufacturer, which, by using advanced production methods, can assemble the product for a price comparable to that of a noncustomized item.
