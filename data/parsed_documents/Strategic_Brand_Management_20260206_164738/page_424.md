Corporate or family brands can establish a number of valuable associations to differentiate the brand, such as common product attributes, benefits, or attitudes; people and relationships; programs and values; and corporate credibility. A corporate image will depend on a number of factors, such as the products a company makes, the actions it takes, and the manner in which it communicates to consumers. Communications may focus on the corporate brand in the abstract or on the different products making up the brand line. Any corporate name changes and rebranding efforts need to be done carefully.

An area of increasing importance for many brands is corporate social responsibility. Firms are becoming more aware of the environmental, economic, and social impact of their words and actions. Many now employ cause-marketing programs designed to align their brands with a cause of importance to their customers. Many consumers are also becoming much more aware of the environmental aspect of the products and services of a firm and how they are produced and disposed.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Pick a company. As completely as possible, characterize its brand portfolio and brand hierarchy. How would you improve the company’s branding strategies?  
2. Do you think the Dow Chemical corporate image campaign described in this chapter will be successful? Why or why not? What do you see as key success factors for a corporate image campaign?  
3. Contrast the branding strategies and brand portfolios of market leaders in two different industries. For example, contrast the approach by Anheuser-Busch and its Budweiser brand with that of Kellogg in the ready-to-eat cereal category.  
4. What are some of the product strategies and communication strategies that General Motors could use to further enhance the level of perceived differentiation between its divisions?  
5. Consider the companies listed in Branding Brief 11-3 as having strong corporate reputations. By examining their Web sites, can you determine why they have such strong corporate reputations?

### BRAND FOCUS 11.0

# Cause Marketing

The 1980s saw the advent of cause marketing. Formally, cause-related (or cause) marketing has been defined as “the process of formulating and implementing marketing activities that are characterized by an offer from the firm to contribute a specified amount to a designated cause when customers engage in revenue-providing exchanges that satisfy organizational and individual objectives.”<sup>64</sup> As Varadarajan and Menon note, the distinctive feature of cause marketing is the link between the firm’s contribution to a designated cause and customers’ engaging in revenue-producing transactions with the firm.

### Advantages of Cause Marketing

One reason for the rise in cause marketing is the positive response it elicits from consumers.<sup>65</sup> Cone Communications, one of the leading firms advising companies on cause-related marketing, found convincing evidence in its 2011 Cone/Echo Global CR Opportunity Study:<sup>66</sup>

* 81 percent of consumers say companies have a responsibility to address key social and environmental issues beyond their local communities.  
* 93 percent of consumers say companies must go beyond legal compliance to operate responsibly.  
* 94 percent of consumers say companies must analyze and evolve their business practices to make their impact as positive as possible.  
* 94 percent would buy a product that has an environmental benefit; 76 percent have already purchased an environmental product in the past 12 months.  
* 93 percent would buy a product associated with a cause; 65 percent have already purchased a cause-related product in the past 12 months.  

Cause or corporate societal marketing (CSM) programs offer many potential benefits to a firm:<sup>67</sup>

* **Building brand awareness:** Because of the nature of the brand exposure, CSM programs can be a means of improving recognition for a brand, although not necessarily recall. Like sponsorship and other indirect forms of brand-building communications, most CSM programs may be better suited to increasing exposure to the brand rather than to tying the brand to specific * consumption or usage situations, because it can be difficult or inappropriate to include product-related information.
