# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 7-2

## Understanding Brand Alliances

Brand alliances, which combine two brands in some way, come in all forms. Academic research has explored the effects of co-branding and ingredient branding strategies.

### Co-Branding

Park, Jun, and Shocker compare co-brands to the notion of “conceptual combinations” in psychology. A conceptual combination (“apartment dog”) consists of a modifying concept, or “modifier” (*apartment*) and a modified concept, or “header” (*dog*). Experimentally, Park and his colleagues explored the different ways that Godiva (associated with expensive, high-calorie boxed chocolates) and Slim-Fast (associated with inexpensive, low-calorie diet food) could hypothetically introduce a chocolate cake mix separately or together through a co-brand.

They found that the co-branded version of the product was better accepted than if either brand attempted to extend individually into the cake mix category. They also found that consumers’ impressions of the co-branded concept were driven by the header brand—Slim-Fast chocolate cake mix by Godiva was seen as lower calorie than if the product was called Godiva chocolate cake mix by Slim-Fast; the reverse was true for associations of richness and luxury. Similarly, consumers’ impressions of Slim-Fast after exposure to the co-branded concept were more likely to change when it was the header brand than when it was the modifier brand. The findings show how carefully selected brands can be combined to overcome the potential problems of negatively correlated attributes (here, rich taste and low calories).

Simonin and Ruth found that consumers’ attitudes toward a brand alliance could influence subsequent impressions of each partner’s brands (spillover effects existed), but that these effects also depended on other factors such as product fit or compatibility and brand fit or image congruity. Brands less familiar than their partners contributed less to an alliance but experienced stronger spillover effects than their more familiar partners. Voss and Tansuhaj found that consumer evaluations of an unknown brand from another country were more positive when it was allied with a well-known domestic brand.

Levin and Levin explored the effects of dual branding, which they defined as a marketing strategy in which two brands, usually restaurants, share the same facilities while providing consumers with the opportunity to use either one or both brands. Kumar found that introducing a co-branded extension into a new product category made it less likely that a brand from the new category could turn around and introduce a counterextension into the original product category. LeBar and colleagues found that joint branding helped to increase a brand’s perceived differentiation, but also sometimes decreased consumers’ perceived esteem for the brand and knowledge about the brand.

### Ingredient Branding

Desai and Keller conducted a laboratory experiment to consider how ingredient branding affected consumer acceptance of an initial line extension, as well as the ability of the brand to introduce future category extensions. They studied two particular types of line extensions, defined as brand expansions: 

1. **slot filler expansions**, in which the level of one existing product attribute changed (a new type of scent in Tide detergent), and  
2. **new attribute expansions**, in which an entirely new attribute or characteristic was added to the product (cough relief liquid added to LifeSavers candy). 

They examined two types of ingredient branding strategies by branding the target attribute ingredient for the brand expansion with either a new name as a **self-branded ingredient** (Tide with its own EverFresh scented bath soap) or an established, well-respected name as a **co-branded ingredient** (Tide with Irish Spring scented bath soap).

The results indicated that with slot filler expansions, although a co-branded ingredient eased initial acceptance of the expansion, a self-branded ingredient led to more favorable later extension evaluations. With more dissimilar new attribute expansions, however, a co-branded ingredient led to more favorable evaluations of both the initial expansion and the subsequent extension.

Venkatesh and Mahajan derived an analytical model based on bundling and reservation price notions to help formulate optimal pricing and partner selection decisions for branded components. In an experimental application in the context of a university computer store selling 486-class laptop computers, they showed that at the bundle level, an all-brand Compaq PC with Intel 486 commanded a clear price premium over other alternatives. The relative brand strength of the Intel brand, however, was shown to be stronger in some senses than that of the Compaq brand.
