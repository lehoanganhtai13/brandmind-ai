**Green:** Del Monte canned vegetables, Green Giant frozen vegetables, Walmart retailers, Starbucks coffee, BP retail gasoline, and 7UP lemon-lime soft drink  
**Blue:** IBM technology and services, Ford automobiles, Windex cleaner, Downy fabric softener, and Pepsi-Cola soft drinks  

Packaging color can affect consumers’ perceptions of the product itself. For example, the darker the orange shade of a can or bottle, the sweeter consumers believe the drink inside to be. Color is thus a critical element of packaging. Like other packaging design elements, color should be consistent with information conveyed by other aspects of the marketing program.

### Packaging Changes.  
Although packaging changes can be expensive, they can be cost-effective compared with other marketing communication costs. Firms change their packaging for a number of reasons:

* *To signal a higher price, or to more effectively sell products through new or shifting distribution channels.* For instance, Kendall Oil redid its package to make it more appealing to do-it-yourselfers when it found more of its sales coming from supermarkets and hardware stores rather than service stations.  
* *When a significant product line expansion would benefit from a common look,* as with Planter’s nuts, Weight Watchers foods, and Stouffer’s frozen foods.  
* *To accompany a new product innovation to signal changes to consumers.* To emphasize the brand’s “green” heritage, Stevia redesigned the packaging on its SweetLeaf product, changing the look and the size and promoting the 100 percent recycled materials used in its manufacture.  
* *When the old package just looks outdated.* Kraft updated its Macaroni & Cheese packaging in 2010—the first time in more than 10 years—to better underscore the brand’s core equities (happiness, smiles, and joy) through a “noodle smile” symbol as well as to unify its three sub-brands.  

Packaging changes have accelerated in recent years as marketers have sought to gain an advantage wherever possible. As one Coca-Cola ad executive noted, “There’s no question the crowded marketplace has inspired companies to change their boxes more often, and there’s greater use of promotional packages to give the appearance that things are changing.”  

In making a packaging change, marketers need to recognize its effect on the original or current customer franchise for the brand. Under these circumstances, marketers must not lose the key package equities that have been built up. Branding Brief 4-3 describes some setbacks marketers have faced updating packaging and other brand elements in recent years.  

To identify or confirm key package equities, consumer research is usually helpful (see Branding Brief 4-3). If packaging recognition is a critical consumer success factor for the brand, however, marketers must be especially careful. It would be a mistake to change the packaging so significantly that consumers don’t recognize it in the store. Retailers’ opinions can also be important too.  

Some marketing observers consider packaging important enough to be the “fifth P” of the marketing mix. Packaging can play an important role in building brand equity directly, through points-of-difference created by functional or aesthetic elements of the packaging, or indirectly through the reinforcement of brand awareness and image. The Science of Branding 4-3 reviews some insightful academic research.

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  
Each brand element can play a different role in building brand equity, so marketers “mix and match” to maximize brand equity. For example, meaningful brand names that are visually represented through logos are easier to remember with than without such reinforcement.  

The entire set of brand elements makes up the **brand identity**, the contribution of all brand elements to awareness and image. The cohesiveness of the brand identity depends on the extent to which the brand elements are consistent. Ideally, marketers choose each element to support the others, and all can be easily incorporated into other aspects of the brand and the marketing program.
