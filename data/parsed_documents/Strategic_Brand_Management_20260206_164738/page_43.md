# Services

Although strong service brands like American Express, British Airways, Ritz-Carlton, Merrill Lynch, and Federal Express have existed for years, the pervasiveness of service branding and its sophistication have accelerated in the past decade.

### Role of Branding with Services.

One of the challenges in marketing services is that they are less tangible than products and more likely to vary in quality, depending on the particular person or people providing them. For that reason, branding can be particularly important to service firms as a way to address intangibility and variability problems. Brand symbols may also be especially important, because they help make the abstract nature of services more concrete. Brands can help identify and provide meaning to the different services provided by a firm. For example, branding has become especially important in financial services to help organize and label the myriad new offerings in a manner that consumers can understand.

Branding a service can also be an effective way to signal to consumers that the firm has designed a particular service offering that is special and deserving of its name. For example, British Airways not only brands its premium business class service as “Club World”; it also brands its regular coach service as “World Traveler,” a clever way to communicate to the airline’s regular passengers that they are also special in some way and that their patronage is not taken for granted. Branding has clearly become a competitive weapon for services.

### Professional Services.

Professional services firm such as Accenture (consulting), Goldman Sachs (investment banking), Ernst & Young (accounting), and Baker Botts (law) offer specialized expertise and support to other businesses and organizations. Professional services branding is an interesting combination of B2B branding and traditional consumer services branding.

Corporate credibility is key in terms of expertise, trustworthiness, and likability. Variability is more of an issue with professional services because it is harder to standardize the services of a consulting firm than those of a typical consumer services firm (like Mayflower movers or Orkin pest control). Long-term relationships are crucial too; losing one customer can be disastrous if it is a big enough account.

One big difference in professional services is that individual employees have a lot more of their own equity in the firm and are often brands in their own right! The challenge is therefore to ensure that their words and actions help build the corporate brand and not just their
