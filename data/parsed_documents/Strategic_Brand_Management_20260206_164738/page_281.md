Second, there must be a reasonable match between the celebrity and the product.³⁹ Many endorsements would seem to fail this test. Despite being featured in their ads, NBA star Kobe Bryant and race car driver Danica Patrick would seem to have no logical connection to Turkish Airlines and Go Daddy Internet domain registrar and Web hosting company, respectively. Some better matches in recent years include comedian Bill Cosby’s playful tone for Jell-O and champion cyclist and cancer-survivor Lance Armstrong for Bristol-Myers Squibb’s cancer medicines.

Third, celebrity endorsers can get in trouble or lose popularity, diminishing their marketing value to the brand, or just fail to live up to expectations. Most companies conduct background checks before signing celebs, but that doesn’t guard against bad behavior in the future. A number of spokespeople over the years have run into legal difficulties, personal problems, or controversies of some form that diminished their marketing value, such as O.J. Simpson, Martha Stewart, and Michael Jackson.⁴⁰ Figure 7-5 is a rogue’s gallery of high-profile celebrity endorsement mishaps. To broaden the appeal and reduce the risks of linking to one celebrity, some marketers have begun to employ several different celebrities or even celebrities who are deceased and therefore a known commodity—dead celebrities were estimated to generate $2.25 billion in revenue in North America in 2009.⁴¹

This data presents a comparative overview of celebrity endorsement mishaps, detailing instances where prominent figures faced consequences for personal or public controversies. The structure highlights specific celebrities and the brands they represented, juxtaposed with the nature of the mishap that led to the termination of their endorsement deals. Examples include actors James Garner and Cybil Shepherd dropped due to health issues and dietary claims, respectively, and athlete Martina Hingis suing her sponsor over an injury. More severe consequences arose from legal and ethical breaches, such as Michael Vick's dog-fighting conviction, Kobe Bryant's sexual assault charges, and Kate Moss's drug use, all resulting in significant financial losses from lost endorsements. Similarly, Michael Phelps and Tiger Woods faced repercussions for drug use and infidelity, respectively, leading to the withdrawal of their brand partnerships. Whoopi Goldberg's case illustrates how public political commentary can also impact endorsement relationships. Fourth, many consumers feel celebrities are doing the endorsement only for the money and do not necessarily believe in or even use the brand.
