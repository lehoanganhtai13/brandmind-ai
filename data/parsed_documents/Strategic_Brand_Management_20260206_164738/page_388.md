# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 11-1

## The Brand–Product Matrix

To characterize the brand architecture strategy of a firm, one useful tool is the *brand–product matrix*, a graphical representation of all the brands and products sold by the firm. The matrix (or grid) has the firm’s brands as rows and the corresponding products as columns (see Figure 11-1).

* The rows of the matrix represent **brand–product relationships**. They capture the firm’s brand-extension strategy in terms of the number and nature of products sold under its different brands. A **brand line** consists of all products—original as well as line and category extensions—sold under a particular brand. Thus, a brand line is one row of the matrix. We want to judge a potential new product extension for a brand on how effectively it leverages existing brand equity from the parent brand to the new product, as well as how effectively the extension, in turn, contributes to the equity of the parent brand.

* The columns of the matrix represent **product–brand relationships**. They capture the brand portfolio strategy in terms of the number and nature of brands to be marketed in each category. The **brand portfolio** is the set of all brands and brand lines that a particular firm offers for sale to buyers in a particular category. Thus, a brand portfolio is one column of the matrix. Marketers design and market different brands to appeal to different market segments.

We can characterize a firm’s brand architecture strategy according to its **breadth** (in terms of brand–product relationships and brand extension strategy) and its **depth** (in terms of product–brand relationships and the brand portfolio or mix). For example, a brand architecture strategy is both deep and broad if the firm has a large number of brands, many of which have been extended into various product categories.

Several other terms are useful to understanding how to characterize the brand architecture strategies of a firm.

* A **product line** is a group of products within a product category that are closely related because they function in a similar manner, are sold to the same customer groups, are marketed through the same type of outlets, or fall within given price ranges. A product line may include different brands, or a single family brand or individual brand that has been line extended. Campbell’s makes a variety of different soup products, varying in flavor, type, sizes, etc.

This table presents a comparative structure, mapping Brands (A, B, ..., M) against a set of Products (1, 2, ..., N). The core relationship illustrated is the presence or absence of each product within each brand's offerings, indicated by the cells at the intersection of a specific brand and a specific product. The ellipsis (...) in both the Brands and Products rows signifies that the table is a generalized representation, capable of accommodating an unspecified number of brands and products. This structure allows for a direct, brand-by-brand comparison of product portfolios, highlighting which brands offer which products and, by extension, identifying product overlaps and unique offerings across the brand landscape.

* A **product mix** (or product assortment) is the set of all product lines and items that a particular seller makes available to buyers. Thus, product lines represent different sets of columns in the brand–product matrix that, in total, make up the product mix. In addition to soup, Campbell’s sells tomato sauces, salsa, vegetable juices, and cookies and crackers.

* A **brand mix** (or brand assortment) is the set of all brand lines that a particular seller makes available to buyers. Campbell’s brand lines include Prego, Pace, V8, and Pepperidge Farm.

A firm like Campbell’s has to make strategic decisions about how many different product lines it should carry (the breadth of the product mix), as well as how many variants to offer in each product line (the depth of the product mix).

As another example, consider Nestlé—the biggest producer of food in the world, with over $100 billion in revenue. Understanding the brand–product matrix and developing the right brand architecture strategy for them is key. Over 1.2 billion people buy Nestlé’s products daily, and 28 of its different brands are approaching or exceed $1 billion in sales. Its global approach of blending local and global brands and diversifying products paid off in the recent recession when it actually gained market share against its competitors.

On the other hand, many brands have transcended their initial market boundaries to become much more. Waste Management is in the process of transforming itself from a “trash company” to a “one-stop, green, environmental services shop” that does a lot more than just collect and dispose of garbage. Its new tag line, “Think Green,” signals the direction it is taking to find ways to extract value from the waste stream through materials-recovery facilities (MRFs) that enable “single-stream recycling.”[^1] Google is clearly in the process of being much more than a search engine as it offers more and more services. Another brand that has already transcended its traditional boundaries is Crayola.
