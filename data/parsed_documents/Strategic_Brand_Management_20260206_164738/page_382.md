Awareness that did not translate into more positive attitudes, however, did little to the stock price (Ameritrade, Juno, and Priceline). The authors conclude, “So it’s not the brands customers know, but the brands customers respect, that are ultimately successful.” Similarly, using *Financial World* estimates of brand equity, another comprehensive study found that brand equity was positively related to stock return and that this effect was incremental to other accounting variables such as the firm’s net income.<sup>50</sup>

Madden, Fehle, and Fournier found that strong brands not only delivered greater returns to stockholders versus a relevant market benchmark, they did so with less risk.<sup>51</sup> Fornell and his colleagues find similar benefits of higher returns and lower risk for satisfied, loyal customers.<sup>52</sup>

## Marketing Activities

Adopting an event study methodology, Lane and Jacobson were able to show that stock market participants’ response to brand extension announcements, consistent with the trade-offs inherent in brand leveraging, depend interactively and nonmonotonically on brand attitude and familiarity.<sup>53</sup>

Specifically, the stock market responded most favorably to extensions of high-esteem, high-familiarity brands (Hershey, Coke, Norton/Symantec) and to low-esteem, low-familiarity brands (in the latter case, presumably because there was little to risk and much to gain with extensions). The stock market reaction was less favorable (and sometimes even negative!) for extensions of brands for which consumer familiarity was disproportionately high compared with consumer regard and to extensions of brands for which consumer regard was disproportionately high compared with familiarity.

In another event study of 58 firms that changed their names in the 1980s, Horsky and Swyngedouw found that for most of the firms, name changes were associated with improved performance; the greatest improvement tended to occur in firms that produced industrial goods and whose performance prior to the change was relatively poor.<sup>54</sup> Not all changes, however, were successful. The researchers interpreted the act of a name change as a signal that other measures to improve performance (changes in product offerings and organizational changes) will be seriously and successfully undertaken.

Rao and his colleagues analyzed financial performance of 113 firms over a five-year period and found that corporate branding strategies were associated with higher values of Tobin’s Q.<sup>55</sup> Tobin’s Q is a forward-looking measure of intangible assets and a firm’s future profit potential, calculated as the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of the firm’s assets.

A mixed branding strategy (where a firm used corporate names for some products and individual names for others) was associated with lower values of Tobin’s Q. The researchers also concluded that most firms would have been able to improve their Tobin’s Q had they adopted a branding strategy different from the one suggested by examining their brand portfolios.

Similarly, Morgan, Rego, and colleagues showed how five brand portfolio characteristics (number of brands owned, number of segments in which they are marketed, degree to which the brands in the firm’s portfolio compete with one another, and consumer perceptions of the quality and price of the brands in the firm’s portfolio) affected a firm’s marketing effectiveness and efficiency and financial performance.<sup>56</sup>

Finally, Mizik and Jacobson found that the stock market reacted favorably when a firm increased its emphasis on value appropriation (extracting profits in the marketplace) over value creation (innovating, producing, and delivering products to the market), although certain qualifying conditions prevailed.<sup>57</sup>

## Accounting Perspectives on Brands<sup>58</sup>

In the period following the Second World War, investors used the physical, tangible assets owned by a company to assess its value. Records show that the market value of companies on major stock markets more or less equaled their book value. Any surplus over book value was called goodwill and was considered to be a reflection of relationships the company had built with suppliers and customers and never amounted to much.

Coinciding with the introduction to business of the mainframe computer in the 1970s and the personal computer in the 1980s, the gap started to open. At the peak of the “dot.com” boom, market value was measured at five times book value.

Traditionally, company annual financial accounts were based on “historic cost”—a record on the balance sheet of what was paid for the tangible assets a company needed to operate the business. But the cost and the value of the asset at current market prices often differed. Asset strippers could buy a company based on the historic cost of its assets and then sell off the assets at market value and make a handsome profit. Since the dot.com bust in 2000, the ratio of market to book has dropped sharply to stabilize over the last 10 years at about 2.8.<sup>59</sup> At the time of the 2008 financial crisis, it dropped below 2 before recovering somewhat afterward.

To provide investors with more readily useful information for making investment decisions, the major accounting bodies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) representing accountants in the rest of the world, took two steps:

1. They moved from historic cost to fair value, which is the price that would be received if an asset were sold in an orderly market between two market participants, that is, the current market value.
2. They began to develop accounting standards to take account of assets that have no monetary value and no physical substance—that is, intangible assets.

Over the past decade, FASB and the IASB have worked on the following four standards relevant to brands.<sup>60</sup>

### IFRS 3 *Business Combinations*

The purpose of this standard is to guide preparers of financial statements in the treatment of companies after a merger or acquisition. A radical aspect of this standard is that it requires acquired goodwill to be allocated to cash generating units. This replaces goodwill as the arithmetic difference between net tangible value and the price paid and calls for it to be broken down into identifiable items. The standard specifies that trademarks and brands will feature among the marketing-based intangibles to be valued and included in the accounts.

### IAS 38 *Intangible Assets*

This standard still has a label that indicates it has not been updated. When this happens, it will take on the IFRS appellation.
