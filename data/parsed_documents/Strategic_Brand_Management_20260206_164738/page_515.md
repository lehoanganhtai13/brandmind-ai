# OREO

In launching its Oreo brand of cookies worldwide, Kraft chose to adopt a consistent global positioning, “Milk’s Favorite Cookie.” Although not necessarily highly relevant in all countries, it did reinforce generally desirable associations like nurturing, caring, and health. To help ensure global understanding, Kraft created a brand book with a CD in an Oreo-shaped box that summarized brand management fundamentals—what needed to be common across countries, what could be changed, and what could not. In time, differences emerged across markets. In China, the original cookie is less sweet than in the United States and has different fillings, such as green tea ice cream, grape–peach, mango–orange, and raspberry–strawberry. In an example of reverse innovation, Kraft has actually successfully introduced some of these Oreo flavors into other countries. Oreo is also making a big push in India, where it is just entering the market and facing stiff competition from major local brands there, such as Parle, Britannia, and Sunfeast. Launch ads reflected Oreo’s updated global positioning based on moments of togetherness and featured a father and son in the “twist, lick, dunk” ritual. Social media has Indian parents sign an “Oreo Togetherness Pledge” promising to spend more quality time with their children. An Oreo Togetherness Bus roams the country providing a platform for parents and children to catch fun family moments. Thanks to international marketing acumen, Oreo now is a $2 billion global brand for Kraft, with 23 million members in its Facebook community.[11]

Next, let’s consider the advantages and disadvantages of creating globally standardized marketing programs for brands.

## ADVANTAGES OF GLOBAL MARKETING PROGRAMS

A number of potential advantages attach to a global marketing program (see Figure 14-1).[12] In general, the less it varies from country to country, the more these advantages will be realized.

### Economies of Scale in Production and Distribution

From a supply-side or cost perspective, the primary advantages of a global marketing program are the manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs that derive from higher volumes in production and distribution. The more that strong experience curve effects exist—driving down the cost of making and marketing a product with increases in production—the more economies of scale in production and distribution from a standardized global marketing program will prevail.
