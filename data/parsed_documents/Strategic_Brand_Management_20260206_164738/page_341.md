As a starting point, they consider the benchmark or “best case” of the visibility of a package when a consumer (1) with 20–20 vision (2) is face-to-face with a package (3) at a distance of less than five feet (4) under ideal lighting conditions.

A key question then is whether the package design is robust enough to be still recognizable if one or more of these four conditions are not present. Because shopping is often not conducted under “ideal” conditions, such insights are important. For example, many consumers who wear eyeglasses do not wear them when shopping in a supermarket. Is the package still able to effectively communicate to consumers under such conditions?

Research methods using tachistoscopes (T-scopes) and eye tracking techniques exist to test the effectiveness of alternative package designs according to a number of specific criteria:

* Degree of shelf impact  
* Impact and recall of specific design elements  
* Perceived package size  
* Copy visibility and legibility  
* Distance at which the package can first be identified  
* Angle at which the package can first be identified  
* Speed with which the package can be identified  

These additional measures can provide more sensitive measures of recognition than simple “yes” or “no” tasks. By applying these direct and indirect measures of brand recognition, marketers can determine which brand elements exist in memory and, to some extent, the strength of their association. One advantage that brand recognition measures have over recall measures is the chance to use visual recognition. It may be difficult for consumers to describe a logo or symbol in a recall task; it’s much easier for them to assess the same elements visually in a recognition task.

Nevertheless, brand recognition measures provide only an approximation of *potential* recallability. To determine whether consumers will actually recall the brand elements under various circumstances, we need measures of brand recall.

### Recall.

To demonstrate brand recall, consumers must retrieve the actual brand element from memory when given some related probe or cue. Thus, brand recall is a more demanding memory task than brand recognition because consumers are not just given a brand element and asked to say whether they’ve seen it before.

Different measures of brand recall are possible depending on the type of cues provided to consumers. *Unaided recall* on the basis of “all brands” provided as a cue is likely to identify
