With the growth of social networks and blogs, a whole range of new online opinion leaders are emerging that can influence the fate of brands. Some come with credentials from traditional businesses or organizations. For example, *Wall Street Journal* technology columnist Walter Mossberg and colleague Kara Swisher have created their own successful technology-focused Web site, www.allthingsd.com. The pair also run an influential annual technology conference, “D: All Things Digital,” where top technology leaders such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have appeared in unscripted interviews.

Other opinion leaders gain influence in different ways through a sequence of events. Justine Ezarik (aka iJustine) had begun “lifecasting” her activities on the Internet, but she really gained fame in August 2007 after posting a viral video of the 300-page AT&T bill she received for her first-generation iPhone. The attention she received for her role in persuading AT&T to change its billing policy—it began to provide usage summaries instead—was the first step in developing a significant YouTube presence. Her videos have since been seen hundreds of millions of times, and she has developed partnerships with companies such as GE, Intel, and Mattel, which value her credibility.[^50]

## REVIEW

This chapter considered the process by which other entities can be leveraged to create secondary associations. These other entities include source factors such as the company that makes a product, where the product is made, and where it is purchased, as well as related people, places, or things. When they link the brand to other entities with their own set of associations, consumers may expect that some of these same associations also characterize the brand.

Thus, independent of how a product is branded, the nature of the product itself, and its supporting marketing program, marketers can create brand equity by “borrowing” it from other sources. Creating secondary associations in this fashion may be quite important if the corresponding brand associations are deficient in some way. Secondary associations may be especially valuable as a means to link favorable brand associations that can serve as points-of-parity or to create unique brand associations that can serve as points-of-difference in positioning a brand.
