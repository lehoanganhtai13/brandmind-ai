This data outlines the marketing efforts of two tiers of sponsors: Official Sponsors and Event Sponsors. The Official Sponsors, including BFGoodrich, Ford, America's Navy, and Red Bull, each engaged in a comprehensive suite of national marketing activities. These typically encompassed television spots, print collateral, digital advertising, on-site activations, and competition course signage, with some variations like radio campaigns for America's Navy and unique signage for Red Bull. The Event Sponsors, comprising Casio G’zOne Commando, Shark Week, Mobil 1, and Sony, also utilized national marketing strategies, though with slightly less breadth. Their efforts commonly included television spots, online advertising, on-site activations, and competition course signage, with specific inclusions like print collateral for Shark Week, radio campaigns for Mobil 1, and on-site TV displays for Sony. The structure highlights a tiered sponsorship model with distinct levels of marketing engagement.

Supply-side methods attempt to approximate the amount of time or space devoted to the brand in media coverage of an event. For example, we can estimate the number of seconds the brand is clearly visible on a television screen, or the column inches of press clippings covering an event that mention the brand.
