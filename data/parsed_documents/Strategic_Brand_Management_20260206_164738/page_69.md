Part II of the text explores how to develop brand strategies. Great brands are not accidents. They are a result of thoughtful and imaginative planning. Anyone building or managing a brand must carefully develop and implement creative brand strategies.

To aid in that planning, three tools or models are helpful. Like the famous Russian nesting *matryoshka* dolls, the three models are interconnected and in turn become larger in scope: the first model is a component in the second model; the second model, in turn, is a component in the third. Combined, the three models provide crucial micro and macro perspectives on successful brand building. These are the three models:

1. *Brand positioning model* describes how to establish competitive advantages in the minds of customers in the marketplace;
2. *Brand resonance model* describes how to take these competitive advantages and create intense, active loyalty relationships with customers for brands; and
3. *Brand value chain model* describes how to trace the value creation process to better understand the financial impact of marketing expenditures and investments to create loyal customers and strong brands.

Collectively, these three models help marketers devise branding strategies and tactics to maximize profits and long-term brand equity and track their progress along the way. Chapter 2 develops the brand positioning model; Chapter 3 reviews the brand resonance and brand value chain models.

This chapter begins, however, by more formally examining the brand equity concept, introducing one particular view—the concept of customer-based brand equity—that will serve as a useful organizing framework for the rest of the book. We’ll consider the sources of customer-based brand equity to provide the groundwork for our discussion of brand positioning.

*Positioning* requires defining our desired or ideal brand knowledge structures and establishing points-of-parity and points-of-difference to establish the right brand identity and brand image. Unique, meaningful *points-of-difference* (PODs) provide a competitive advantage and the “reason why” consumers should buy the brand. On the other hand, some brand associations can be roughly as favorable as those of competing brands, so they function as *points-of-parity* (POPs) in consumers’ minds—and negate potential points-of-difference for competitors. In other words, these associations are designed to provide “no reason why not” for consumers to choose the brand.

The chapter then reviews how to identify and establish brand positioning and create a brand mantra, a shorthand expression of the positioning. We conclude with Brand Focus 2.0 and an examination of the many benefits of creating a strong brand.

# CUSTOMER-BASED BRAND EQUITY

Two questions often arise in brand marketing: What makes a brand strong? and How do you build a strong brand? To help answer both, we introduce the concept of customer-based brand equity (CBBE). Although a number of useful perspectives concerning brand equity have been put forth, the CBBE concept provides a unique point of view on what brand equity is and how it should best be built, measured, and managed.

## Defining Customer-Based Brand Equity

The CBBE concept approaches brand equity from the perspective of the consumer—whether the consumer is an individual or an organization or an existing or prospective customer. Understanding the needs and wants of consumers and organizations and devising products and programs to satisfy them are at the heart of successful marketing. In particular, marketers face two fundamentally important questions: What do different brands mean to consumers?
