This practice got a boost in 1982 when—after Mars declined an offer for use of its M&M’s brand—sales of Reese’s Pieces increased 65 percent after the candy appeared prominently in the blockbuster movie *E.T.: The Extraterrestrial.*[^32]

More recently, many brands such as Chase, Hilton, AT Cross, and Heineken have paid to be featured in the popular TV series *Mad Men.*[^33] Marketers combine product placements with special promotions to publicize a brand’s entertainment tie-ins and create “branded entertainment.” For example, BMW complemented product placement in the James Bond film *Goldeneye* with an extensive direct mail and advertising campaign to help launch its Z3 roadster.

Programming includes a store-selected music format, consumer tips, and commercials. The Walmart Smart Network is beamed to over 2,700 of the retail giant’s stores and is a mixture of information content and advertising.[^34]

The appeal of point-of-purchase advertising lies in the fact that, as numerous studies have shown, consumers in many product categories make the bulk of their final brand decisions in the store. In-store media are designed to increase the number and nature of spontaneous and planned buying decisions. One company placing ads on the entryway security panels of major retail chains reported that the advertised brands experienced an average increase in sales of 20 percent over the four-week period in which their ads appeared.[^35]

**Guidelines.** Nontraditional or place media present some interesting options for marketers to reach consumers in new ways. Ads now can appear virtually any place where consumers have a
