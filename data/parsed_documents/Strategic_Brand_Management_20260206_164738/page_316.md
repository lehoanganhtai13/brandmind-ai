# DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. What do you see as the biggest challenges in conducting a brand audit? What steps would you take to overcome them?  
2. Pick a brand. See if you can assemble a brand inventory for it.  
3. Consider the McDonald’s tracking survey presented in Branding Brief 8-1. What might you do differently? What questions would you change or drop? What questions might you add? How might this tracking survey differ from those used for other products?  
4. Can you develop a tracking survey for the Mayo Clinic? How might it differ from the McDonald’s tracking survey?  
5. Critique the Rolex brand audit in Brand Focus 8.0. How do you think it could be improved?

# BRAND FOCUS 8.0

## Rolex Brand Audit

For over a century, Rolex has remained one of the most recognized and sought-after luxury brands in the world. In 2009, *Businessweek*/Interbrand ranked Rolex as the 71st most valuable global brand, with an estimated brand value of $5 billion.  
A thorough audit can help pinpoint opportunities and challenges for Rolex, whose brand equity has been historically strong, as much is at stake.

### BACKGROUND

#### History

Rolex was founded in 1905 by a German named Hans Wilsdorf and his brother-in-law, William Davis, as a watch-making company, Wilsdorf & Davis, with headquarters in London, England. Wilsdorf, a self-proclaimed perfectionist, set out to improve the mainstream pocket watch right from the start. By 1908, he had created a timepiece that kept accurate time but was small enough to be worn on the wrist. That same year, Wilsdorf trademarked the name “Rolex” because he thought it sounded like the noise a watch made when it was wound. Rolex was also easy to pronounce in many different languages.

In 1912, Rolex moved its headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland, and started working on improving the reliability of its watches. Back then, dust and moisture could enter the watch case and cause damage to the movement or internal mechanism of the watch. As a result, Wilsdorf invented a screw crown and waterproof casebook mechanism that revolutionized the watch industry. In 1914, the Rolex wristwatch obtained the first Kew “A” certificate after passing the world’s toughest timing test, which included testing the watch at extreme temperature levels.

Twelve years later, Wilsdorf developed and patented the now famous Oyster waterproof case and screw crown. This mechanism became the first true protection against water, dust, and dirt. To generate publicity for the watch, jewelry stores displayed fish tanks in their windows with the Oyster watch completely submerged in it. The Oyster was put to the test on October 7, 1927, when Mercedes Gleitze swam the English Channel wearing one. She emerged 15 hours later with the watch functioning perfectly, much to the amazement of the media and public. Gleitze became the first of a long list of “ambassadors” that Rolex has used to promote its wristwatches.

Over the years, Rolex has pushed innovation in watches to new levels. In 1931, the firm introduced the Perpetual self-winding rotor mechanism, eliminating the need to wind a watch. In 1945, the company invented the first watch to display a number date at the 3 o’clock position and named it the Datejust. In 1953, Rolex launched the Submariner—the first diving watch that was water-resistant and pressure-resistant to 100 meters. The sporty watch appeared in various James Bond movies in the 1950s and became an instant symbol of prestige and durability.

For decades, Swiss-made watches owned the middle and high-end markets, remaining virtually unrivaled until the invention of the quartz watch in 1969. Quartz watches kept more accurate time, were less expensive to make, and quickly dominated the middle market. Within 10 years, quartz watches made up approximately half of all watch sales worldwide. Joe Thompson, editor of *Modern Jeweler*, a U.S. trade publication, explained, “By 1980, people thought the mechanical watch was dead.”

Rolex proved the experts wrong. The company would not give in to the quartz watch rage. In order to survive, however, Rolex was forced to move into the high-end market exclusively—leaving the middle to the quartz people—and create a strategy to defend and build its position there.

### Private Ownership

Rolex is a privately owned company and has been controlled by only three people in its 100-year history. Before Wilsdorf died, he set up the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, ensuring that some of the company’s income would go to charity and that control of the company lay with the foundation. This move was a critical step toward the long-term success of Rolex as a high-end brand. Over the years, many luxury brands have been forced to • Air-King<br>
