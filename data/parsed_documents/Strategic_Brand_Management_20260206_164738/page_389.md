## CRAYOLA

Crayola, known for its crayons, first sought to expand its brand meaning by making some fairly direct brand extensions into other drawing and coloring implements, such as markers, pencils, paints, pens, brushes, and chalk. The company further expanded beyond coloring and drawing into arts and crafts, with extensions such as Crayola Chalk, Crayola Clay, Crayola Dough, Crayola Glitter Glue, and Crayola Scissors. These extensions established a new brand meaning for Crayola as “colorful arts and crafts for kids.” Crayola says its brand essence is to find the “what if” in each child:

> “We believe in unleashing, nurturing and celebrating the colorful originality in every child. We give kids an invitation that ignites, colors that inspire, and tools that transform original thoughts into visible form. We give colorful wings to the invisible things that grow in the hearts of children. Because we believe that creatively alive kids grow into inspired adults.”

Subsequent category extensions allowed kids to use their imagination to create colorful jewelry, glow-in-the-dark animation, and comic books.²

Without a clear understanding of its current equity, however, it is difficult to understand what the brand could be built on. A good brand vision has a foot in both the present and the future. Brand vision obviously needs to be aspirational, so the brand has room to grow and improve in the future, yet it cannot be unobtainable. The trick is to strike the right balance between what the brand is and what it could become, and to identify the right steps to get it there.

Fundamentally, brand vision relates to the “higher-order purpose” of the brand, based on keen understanding of consumer aspirations and brand truths. It transcends the brand’s physical product category descriptions and boundaries. P&G’s legendary former CMO Jim Stengel maintains that successful brands have clear “ideals”—such as “eliciting joy, enabling connection, inspiring exploration, evoking pride or impacting society”—and a strong purpose of building customer loyalty and driving revenue growth.³ The Science of Branding 11-2 describes one perspective on how firms can maximize a brand’s long-term value according to their vision of its potential.

### Defining the Brand Boundaries.

Some of the world’s strongest brands, such as GE, Virgin, and Apple, have been stretched across multiple categories. Defining brand boundaries thus means—based on the brand vision and positioning—identifying the products or services the brand should offer, the benefits it should supply, and the needs it should satisfy.
