The days when Henry Ford II could name his new automobile the “Edsel” after the name of a family member seem to be long gone.

Is it difficult to come up with a brand name? Ira Bachrach, a well-known branding consultant, has noted that although there are 140,000 words in the English vocabulary, the average U.S. adult recognizes only 20,000; Bachrach’s consulting company, NameLab, sticks to the 7,000 words that make up the vocabulary of most TV programs and commercials.

Although that may seem to allow a lot of choices, each year tens of thousands of new brands are registered as legal trademarks. In fact, arriving at a satisfactory brand name for a new product can be a painfully difficult and prolonged process. After realizing that most of the desirable brand names are already legally registered, many a frustrated executive has lamented that “all the good ones are taken.”

In some ways, this difficulty should not be surprising. Any parent can probably sympathize with how hard it can be to choose a name for a child, as evidenced by the thousands of babies born without names each year because their parents have not decided on—or perhaps not agreed upon—a name yet. It is rare that naming a product can be as easy as it was for Ford when it introduced the Taurus automobile.

“Taurus” was the code name given to the car during its design stage because the chief engineer’s and product manager’s wives were both born under that astrological sign. As luck would have it, upon closer examination, the name turned out to have a number of desirable characteristics. When it was chosen as the actual name for the car, Ford saved thousands and thousands of dollars in additional research and consulting expenses.

### Naming Guidelines.  
Selecting a brand name for a new product is certainly an art and a science. Figure 4-3 displays the different types of possible brand names according to brand identity experts Lippincott. Like any brand element, brand names must be chosen with the six general criteria of memorability, meaningfulness, likability, transferability, adaptability, and protectability in mind.

**Brand Awareness**  
Brand names that are simple and easy to pronounce or spell, familiar and meaningful, and different, distinctive, and unusual can obviously improve brand awareness.<sup>7</sup>

**Simplicity and Ease of Pronunciation and Spelling.**  
Simplicity reduces the effort consumers have to make to comprehend and process the brand name. Short names often facilitate recall because they are easy to encode and store in memory—consider Aim toothpaste, Raid pest spray, Bold laundry detergent, Suave shampoo, Off insect repellent, Jif peanut butter, Ban deodorant, and Bic pens. Marketers can shorten longer names to make them easier to recall. For example, over the years Chevrolet cars have also become known as “Chevy,” Budweiser beer has become “Bud,” and Coca-Cola is also “Coke.”<sup>8</sup>

Figure 4-3 presents a taxonomy of brand names, categorizing them based on their origin and nature. The categories include "Surname" brands, exemplified by Dell, Siemens, and Gillette, which are derived from personal names. "Descriptive" brands, such as American Online, Pizza Hut, and General Motors, convey a direct characteristic or benefit of the product or service. "Invented" brands, like Häagen-Dazs, Kodak, and Xerox, are entirely fabricated words. "Connotative" brands, including Duracell, Humana, and Infiniti, evoke a particular feeling or association. "Bridge" brands, such as Westin, DaimlerChrysler, and ExxonMobil, combine elements to create a new identity. Finally, "Arbitrary" brands, like Apple, Yahoo!, and Infiniti, have no inherent connection to the product or service they represent. This taxonomy illustrates diverse strategies employed in brand naming. To encourage word-of-mouth exposure that helps build strong memory links, marketers should also make brand names easy to pronounce.
