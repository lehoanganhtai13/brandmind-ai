**Complementarity.** Communication options are often more effective when used in tandem. *Complementarity* describes the extent to which *different* associations and linkages are emphasized across communication options. The ideal marketing communication program would ensure that the communication options chosen are mutually compensatory and reinforcing to create desired consumer knowledge structures.  
Marketers might most effectively establish different brand associations by capitalizing on those marketing communication options best suited to eliciting a particular consumer response or establishing a particular type of brand association. For example, some media, like sampling and other forms of sales promotion, are demonstrably better at generating trial than engendering long-term loyalty. Research with some industrial distributors has shown that follow-up sales efforts generate higher sales productivity when firms have already exposed customers to its products at a trade show.<sup>93</sup>  
The Science of Branding 6-2 describes how communication options may need to be explicitly tied together to capitalize on complementarity to build brand equity.

**Conformability.** Conformability refers to the extent that a marketing communication option is robust and effective for different groups of consumers. There are two types of conformability: communication and consumer. The reality of any IMC program is that when consumers are exposed to a particular marketing communication, some consumers will have already been exposed to other marketing communications for the brand, and others will not. The ability of a marketing communication to work at two levels—effectively communicating to both groups—is critically important. We consider a marketing communication option conformable when it achieves its desired effect *regardless* of consumers’ past communication history.  
Besides this communication conformability, we can also judge a communication option in terms of broader consumer conformability, that is, how well does it inform or persuade consumers who vary on dimensions other than communication history? Communications directed at primarily creating brand awareness, like sponsorship, may be more conformable by virtue of their simplicity.  
There seem to be two possible means of achieving this dual communication ability:

1. *Multiple information provision strategy*: Provide different information within a communication option to appeal to the different types of consumers. An important issue here is how information designed to appeal to one target market of consumers will be processed by other consumers and target markets. Issues of information overload, confusion, and annoyance may come into play if communications become burdened with a great deal of detail.  
2. *Broad information provision strategy*: Provide information that is rich or ambiguous enough to work regardless of prior consumer knowledge. The important issue here is how potent or successful marketers can make that information. If they attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the information may lack precision and sufficient detail to have any meaningful impact on consumers. Consumers with disparate backgrounds will have to find information in the communication sufficiently relevant to satisfy their goals, given their product or brand knowledge or communications history.

**Cost.** Finally, evaluations of marketing communications on all of the preceding criteria must be weighed against their cost to arrive at the most effective *and* efficient communication program.

### Using IMC Choice Criteria  
The IMC choice criteria can provide some guidance for designing integrated marketing communication programs. Two key steps are evaluating communication options and establishing priorities and trade-offs.
