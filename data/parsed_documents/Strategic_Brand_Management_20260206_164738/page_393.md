## Crafting the Brand Positioning.

Brand positioning puts some specificity into a brand vision. Chapter 2 reviewed brand positioning considerations in detail; the four key ingredients are: (1) competitive frame of reference, (2) points-of-difference, (3) points-of-parity, and (4) brand mantra. The brand mantra in particular can be very useful in establishing product boundaries or brand “guardrails.” It should offer rational and emotional benefits and be sufficiently robust to permit growth, relevant enough to drive consumer and retailer interest, and differentiated enough to sustain longevity.

## Step 2: Identifying Brand Extension Opportunities

Determining the brand vision, boundaries, and positioning in Step 1 helps define the brand potential and provides a clear sense of direction for the brand. Step 2 is to identify new products and services to achieve that potential through a well-designed and implemented brand extension strategy.

A brand extension is a new product introduced under an existing brand name. We differentiate between *line extensions*, new product introductions within existing categories (Tide Total Care laundry detergent), and *category extensions*, new product introductions outside existing categories (Tide Dry Cleaners retail outlets).

It is important to carefully plan the optimal sequence of brand extensions to achieve brand potential. The key is to understand equity implications of each extension in terms of points-of-parity and points-of-difference. By adhering to the brand promise and growing the brand carefully through “little steps,” marketers can ensure that brands cover a lot of ground.

For example, through a well-planned and well-executed series of new product introductions in the form of category extensions over a 25-year period, Nike evolved from a company selling running, tennis, and basketball shoes to mostly males between the ages of 12 and 29 in North America in the mid-1980s, to a company now selling athletic shoes, clothing, and equipment across a range of sports to men and women of all ages in virtually all countries.

Launching a brand extension is harder than it might seem. Given that the vast majority of new products are extensions and the vast majority of new products fail, the clear implication is that too many brand extensions fail. An increasingly competitive marketplace will be even more unforgiving to poorly positioned and marketed extensions in the years to come. To increase the likelihood of success, marketers must be rigorous and disciplined in their analysis and development of brand extensions. Chapter 12 provides detailed guidelines for successful brand extension strategies.

## Step 3: Branding New Products and Services

The final step in developing the brand architecture is to decide on the specific brand elements to use for any particular new product or service associated with the brand. New products and services must be branded in a way to maximize the brand’s overall clarity and understanding to consumers and customers. What names, looks, and other branding elements are to be applied to the new and existing products for any one brand?

One way we can distinguish brand architecture strategies is by looking at whether a firm is employing an umbrella corporate or family brand for all its products, known as a “branded house,” or a collection of individual brands all with different names, known as a “house of brands.”

* Firms largely employing a branded house strategy include many business-to-business industrial firms, such as Siemens, Oracle, and Goldman Sachs.  
* Firms largely employing a house of brands strategy include consumer product companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and ConAgra.

The reality is that most firms adopt a strategy somewhere between these two end points, often employing various types of sub-brands. *Sub-brands* are an extremely popular form of brand extension in which the new product carries both the parent brand name and a new name (Apple iPad, Ford Fusion, and American Express Blue card).

A good sub-branding strategy can tap associations and attitudes about the company or family brand as a whole, while also allowing for the creation of new brand beliefs to position the extension in the new category. For example, Hershey’s Kisses taps into the quality, heritage, and familiarity of the Hershey’s brand but at the same time has a much more playful and fun A match made in foil.
