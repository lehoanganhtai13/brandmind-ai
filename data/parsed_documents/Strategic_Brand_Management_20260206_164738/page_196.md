All these efforts were met with greater customer acceptance: the number of potential U.S. buyers who say they would “definitely” consider a Hyundai tripled from 2000 to 2009. Hyundai’s current Assurance program is centered on a new Trade-in Value Guarantee that preserves the market value of a new Hyundai by guaranteeing to customers at the time of purchase exactly how much it would be worth, two, three, or four years from now.49

### Product Design and Delivery.

The first key is the proper design and delivery of the product. Product value can be enhanced through many types of well-conceived and well-executed marketing programs, such as those covered in this and other chapters of the book. Proponents of value pricing point out that the concept does not mean selling stripped-down versions of products at lower prices. Consumers are willing to pay premiums when they perceive added value in products and services.

Some companies actually have been able to *increase* prices by skillfully introducing new or improved “value-added” products. Some marketers have coupled well-marketed product innovations and improvements with higher prices to strike an acceptable balance to at least some market segments. Here are two examples of Procter & Gamble brands that used that formula to find marketplace success in the midst of the deep recession of 2008–2010.

* P&G introduced its most expensive Gillette razor ever, the Fusion ProGlide, by combining an innovative product with strong marketing support. Its “Turning Shaving into Gliding and Skeptics into Believers” campaign for Fusion ProGlide gave sample razors to bloggers and ran ads online and on TV showing men outside their homes given impromptu shaves with the new razor.50
* P&G’s Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy liquid was able to command a 60 percent price premium over private labels through a blend of product innovation (new cherry flavors) and an engaging advertising campaign that broke copy-testing research records for the brand (“Coverage” featuring a headset-wearing, pink-vested “Pepto Guy” fielding calls and offering humorous advice to gastrointestinally challenged callers).51

With the advent of the Internet, many critics predicted that customers’ ability to perform extensive, assisted online searches would result in only low-cost providers surviving. In reality, the advantages of creating strong brand differentiation have led to price premiums when brands are sold online just as much as when sold offline. For example, although undersold by numerous book and music sellers online, Amazon.com was able to maintain market leadership, eventually forcing low-priced competitors such as Books.com and others out of business.52

### Product Costs.

The second key to a successful value-pricing strategy is to lower costs as much as possible. Meeting cost targets invariably requires finding additional cost savings through productivity gains, outsourcing, material substitution (less expensive or less wasteful materials), Famous athletes and celebrities—such as NBA player Tony Parker, WWE wrestler John Cena, and TV sportscaster Erin Andrews—have promoted Gillette’s latest Fusion ProGlide razor and its innovative performance features.
