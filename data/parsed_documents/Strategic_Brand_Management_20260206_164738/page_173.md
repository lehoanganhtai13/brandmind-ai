# Counterfeit and Imitator Brands

This appendix highlights a few key legal branding considerations. For more comprehensive treatments, it is necessary to consider other sources. [83]

Why is trademark protection of brand elements such as brand names, logos, and symbols such an important brand management priority? As noted above, virtually any product is fair game for illegal counterfeiting or questionable copycat mimicking—from Nike apparel to Windows software, and from Similac baby formula to ACDelco auto parts. [84]

In addition, some products attempt to gain market share by imitating successful brands. These copycat brands may mimic any one of the possible brand elements, such as brand names or packaging. For example, Calvin Klein’s popular Obsession perfume and cologne has had to withstand imitators such as Compulsion, Enamoured, and Confess, whose package slogan proclaimed, “If you like Obsession, you’ll love Confess.”

Many copycat brands are put forth by retailers as store brands, putting national brands in the dilemma of protecting their trade dress by cracking down on some of their best customers. Complicating matters is the fact that if challenged, many private labels contend, with some justification, that they should be permitted to continue labeling and packaging practices that have come to identify entire categories of products rather than a single national brand. [85] In other words, certain packaging looks may become a necessary point-of-parity in a product category. A common victim of brand cloning, Contac cold medication underwent its first packaging overhaul in 33 years to better prevent knockoffs as well as update its image.

Many national brand manufacturers are also responding through legal action. For national brands, the key is proving that brand clones are misleading consumers, who may think that they are buying national brands. The burden of proof is to establish that an appreciable number of reasonably acting consumers are confused and mistaken in their purchases. [86] In such cases, many factors might be considered by courts in determining likelihood of confusion, such as the strength of the national brand’s mark, the relatedness of the national brand and brand clone products, the similarity of the marks, evidence of actual confusion, the similarity of marketing channels used, the likely degree of buyer care, the brand clone’s intent in selecting the mark, and the likelihood of expansion of the product lines.

Simonson provides an in-depth discussion of these issues and methods to assess the likelihood of confusion and “genericness” of a trademark. He stresses the importance of recognizing that consumers may vary in their level or degree of confusion and that it is difficult as a result to identify a precise threshold level above which confusion occurs. He also notes how survey research methods must accurately reflect the consumers’ state of mind when engaged in marketplace activities. [87]

## Historical and Legal Precedence

Simonson and Holbrook have made some provocative observations about and connections between appropriation and dilution, making the following points. [88] They begin by noting that legally, a brand name is a “conditional-type property”—protected only after it has been used in commerce to identify products (goods or services) and only in relation to those products or to closely related offerings. To preserve a brand name’s role in identifying products, the authors note, federal law protects brands from actions of others that may tend to cause confusion concerning proper source identification.

By contrast with the case of confusion, Simonson and Holbrook identify **trademark appropriation** as a developing area of state law that can severely curtail even those brand strategies that do not “confuse” consumers. They define appropriation in terms of enhancing the image of a new offering via the use of some property aspect of an existing brand. That is, appropriation resembles theft of an intangible property right. They note that the typical argument to prevent imitations is that even in the absence of confusion, a weaker brand will tend to benefit by imitating an existing brand name. Jerre Swann similarly argues that “the owner of a strong, unique brand should thus be entitled, incipiently, to prevent impairment of the brand’s communicative clarity by its substantial association with another brand, particularly where there is an element of misappropriation.” [89]

Simonson and Holbrook also summarize the legal concept of **trademark dilution**:

> Protection from “dilution”—a weakening or reduction in the ability of a mark to clearly and unmistakably distinguish the source—arose in 1927 when a legal ruling declared that “once a mark has come to indicate to the public a constant and uniform source of satisfaction, its owner should be allowed the broadest scope possible for the ‘natural expansion of his trade’ to other lines or fields of enterprise.”

They observe that two brand-related rights followed: (1) the right to preempt and preserve areas for brand extensions and (2) the right to stop the introduction of similar or identical brand names even in the absence of consumer confusion so as to protect a brand’s image and distinctiveness from being diluted.

Dilution can occur in three ways: blurring, tarnishment, and cybersquatting. [90]  
- **Blurring** happens when the use of an existing mark by a different company in a different category alters the “unique and distinctive significance” of that mark.  
- **Tarnishment** is when a different company employs the mark in order to degrade its quality, such as in the context of a parody or satire.  
- **Cybersquatting** occurs when an unaffiliated party purchases an Internet “domain name consisting of the mark or name of a company for the purpose of relinquishing the right to that domain name to the legitimate owner for a price.” [91]

New American laws register trademarks for only 10 years (instead of 20); to renew trademarks, firms must prove they are using the name and not just holding it in reserve. The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 allowed entities to apply for a trademark based on their “intent to use” it within 36 months, eliminating the need to have an actual product in the works. To determine legal status, marketers must search trademark registrations, brand name directories, phone books, trade journals and advertisements, and so forth. As a result, the pool of potentially available trademarks has shrunk. [92]

The remainder of this appendix describes some of the particular issues involved with two important brand elements: brand names and packaging.

## Trademark Issues Concerning Names

Without adequate trademark protection, brand names can become legally declared generic, as was the case with *vaseline*, *victrola*, *cellophane*, *escalator*, and *thermos*. For example, when Bayer set out to trademark the “wonder drug” acetylsalicylic acid, they failed to provide a “generic” term or common descriptor for the product and provided only a trademark, Aspirin. Without any other option available in the language, the trademark became the common name for the product. In 1921, a U.S.
