To what extent do you feel the following product characteristics are descriptive of Lipton iced tea (where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree)?

This data presents a set of desirable attributes or characteristics, likely associated with a product or service. These attributes are categorized into several key areas: functional benefits such as being "convenient," "refreshing and thirst quenching," and "good-tasting"; perceived authenticity and quality, indicated by "real and natural"; and market positioning, described as "contemporary and relevant" and specifically "used by young professionals." The overall structure suggests a profile of positive qualities designed to appeal to a target demographic, emphasizing both practical advantages and lifestyle alignment.

2. How good or bad is it for iced tea to have the following product characteristics (where 1 = very bad and 7 = very good)?

This data presents a set of desirable attributes or characteristics, likely associated with a product or service. These attributes are categorized into several key areas: functional benefits such as being "convenient," "refreshing and thirst quenching," and "good-tasting"; perceived authenticity and quality, indicated by "real and natural"; and market positioning, described as "contemporary and relevant" and specifically "used by young professionals." The overall structure suggests a profile of positive qualities designed to appeal to a target demographic, emphasizing both practical advantages and lifestyle alignment.

3. How unique is Lipton iced tea in terms of the following product characteristics (where 1 = not at all unique and 7 = highly unique)?

This data presents a set of desirable attributes or characteristics, likely associated with a product or service. These attributes are categorized into several key areas: functional benefits such as being "convenient," "refreshing and thirst quenching," and "good-tasting"; perceived authenticity and quality, indicated by "real and natural"; and market positioning, described as "contemporary and relevant" and specifically "used by young professionals." The overall structure suggests a profile of positive qualities designed to appeal to a target demographic, emphasizing both practical advantages and lifestyle alignment.

Example of Brand Association Ratings in Terms of Strength, Favorability, and Uniqueness

To gain more specific insights, we could rate these belief associations according to strength, favorability, and uniqueness, as Figure 9-7 illustrates with Lipton iced tea. Indirect tests also can assess the derived importance and favorability of these brand associations (through multivariate regression techniques).

### Other Approaches.  
A more complicated quantitative technique to assess overall brand uniqueness is multidimensional scaling, or perceptual maps. *Multidimensional scaling* (MDS) is a procedure for determining the perceived relative images of a set of objects, such as products or brands. MDS transforms consumer judgments of similarity or preference into distances represented in perceptual space. For example, if brands A and B are judged by respondents to be the most similar of a set of brands, the MDS algorithm will position brands A and B so that the distance between them in multidimensional space is smaller than the distance between any other two pairs of brands. Respondents may base their similarity between brands on any basis—tangible or intangible.<sup>43</sup>

Figure 9-8 displays a hypothetical perceptual map of restaurants in a particular market. Segment 1 is more concerned with health than taste and is well targeted by Brand B; segment 2 is more concerned with taste and is well targeted by Brand C. Brand A is trapped in the middle. It either must improve taste to provide a healthy alternative to Brand C for segment 2, or it must improve healthiness to prove a tastier alternative to Brand B for segment 1.

## Brand Responses  
The purpose of measuring more general, higher-level considerations is to find out how consumers combine all the more specific, lower-level considerations about the brand in their minds to form different types of brand responses and evaluations. Chapter 2 provided examples of measures of key brand judgments and feelings. Here we delve into more detail.

### Purchase Intentions.  
Another set of measures closely related to brand attitudes and consideration looks at purchase intentions<sup>44</sup> and focus on the likelihood of buying the brand or of switching to another brand. Research in psychology suggests that purchase intentions are most likely to **FIGURE 9-8**
