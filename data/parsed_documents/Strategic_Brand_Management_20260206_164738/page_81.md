This table outlines a two-dimensional framework for classifying goods, based on "Behavioral" characteristics and the "Nature of Good." The behavioral dimensions include user status, usage rate, usage occasion, brand loyalty, and benefits sought. These factors describe how consumers interact with and perceive products. Correspondingly, the nature of good is categorized by its kind, where it is used, and the type of purchase involved. This structure suggests a comparative approach, where behavioral aspects are mapped against inherent product attributes to understand market segmentation and consumer behavior in relation to different types of goods.

This table outlines two primary categories for market segmentation: Demographic and Buying Condition. The Demographic category encompasses several key characteristics of consumers, including their Income, Age, Sex, Race, and Family structure. These are fundamental attributes used to define distinct consumer groups. The Buying Condition category, in contrast, focuses on the circumstances surrounding a purchase. This includes the Purchase location, Who buys the product, and the Type of buy. Together, these categories provide a framework for understanding and segmenting markets by both inherent consumer traits and the context of their purchasing behavior, suggesting a comparative approach to market analysis.

This table outlines two primary categories for market segmentation: Psychographic and Demographic. The Psychographic category encompasses internal characteristics of consumers, specifically their values, opinions, and attitudes, as well as their observable activities and lifestyle choices. In contrast, the Demographic category focuses on quantifiable, external attributes of businesses or organizations. These include their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, which denotes their industry, the total number of employees, and a breakdown of production workers. Further demographic indicators include the annual sales volume and the total number of establishments associated with the business. This structure suggests a comparative approach to segmentation, where psychographic factors are contrasted with demographic data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a target market.

This table outlines a hierarchical geographic structure, beginning with the broadest category, International, which encompasses all global operations. Nested beneath this is the Regional level, indicating a subdivision of international scope into more localized areas. The table implicitly suggests that activities or entities are organized first on a worldwide scale and then further delineated into distinct geographic regions for management, operational, or analytical purposes. This structure facilitates understanding the scope and scale of operations, moving from a global perspective down to specific territorial divisions.

Business-to-Business Segmentation Bases</p>

<p>Given this market segmentation scheme, marketing programs could be put into place to attract one or more segments. For example, Close-Up initially targeted the first two segments, whereas Crest primarily concentrated on the third. Taking no chances, Aquafresh was introduced to go after all three segments, designing its toothpaste with three stripes to dramatize each of the three product benefits. With the success of multipurpose toothpastes such as Colgate Total, virtually all brands now offer products that emphasize multiple performance benefits.</p>

<p>Other segmentation approaches build on brand loyalty in some way. The classic “funnel” model traces consumer behavior in terms of initial awareness through brand-most-often-used. Figure 2-5 shows a hypothetical pattern of results. For the purposes of brand building, marketers want to understand both (1) the percentage of target market that is present at each stage and (2) factors facilitating or inhibiting the transition from one stage to the next. In the hypothetical example, a key bottleneck appears to be converting those consumers who have ever tried the brand to those who recently tried, as less than half (46 percent) “convert.” To convince more consumers to consider trying the brand again, marketers may need to raise brand salience or make the brand more acceptable in the target consumer’s repertoire.</p>

<p>Marketers often segment consumers by their behavior. For example, a firm may target a certain age group, but the underlying reason is that they are particularly heavy users of the product, are unusually brand loyal, or are most likely to seek the benefit the product is best able to deliver. Nestlé’s Yorkie chocolate is boldly marketed in the U.K. as “It is Not For Girls” because the chunky bar is thought to appeal more to men.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, broad demographic descriptors may mask important underlying differences.<sup>31</sup>  A fairly specific target market of “women aged 40 to 49” may contain a number of very different segments who require totally different marketing mixes (think Celine Dion vs. Courtney Love). Baby boomers are difficult to segment based on the size of the generation and individual views on aging. Age Wave, a consulting firm, created four segments for post-retirement consumers: “ageless explorers,” “comfortably contents,” “live for todays,” and “sick and tireds.”<sup>32</sup></p>

<p>The main advantage of demographic segmentation bases is that the demographics of traditional media vehicles are generally well known from consumer research; as a result, it has been easier to buy media on that basis. With the growing importance of digital and nontraditional media and other forms of communication as well as the capability to build databases to profile customers on a behavioral and media usage basis, however, this advantage has become less important. For example, online Web sites can now target such previously hard-to-reach markets as African Americans (BlackPlanet.com), Hispanics (Quepasa.com), Asian Americans (AsianAvenue.com), college students (teen.com), and gays (gay.com).</p> **FIGURE 2-5**
