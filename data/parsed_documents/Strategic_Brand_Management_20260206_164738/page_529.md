# DEVELOPING VERSUS DEVELOPED MARKETS

Perhaps the most basic distinction we make between the countries that global brands enter is whether they are developing or have developed markets. Some of the most important developing markets are captured by the acronym BRICS (for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). To that list, many marketing experts would add Indonesia. Some experts also refer to the five Rs of currency in developing markets: the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupee, the Chinese renminbi, and the Indonesian rupiah.⁴⁴ These countries are considered *developing* in that they do not yet have the infrastructure, institutions, and other features that characterize more fully developed economies in North America and Western Europe, for example. Yet they are among the largest and fastest-growing and have received much attention from companies all over the world.

Differences in consumer behavior, marketing infrastructure, competitive frame of reference, and so on are so profoundly different among developing markets, though, that distinct marketing programs are often needed for each. Often the product category itself may not be well developed, so the marketing program must operate at a very fundamental level. Consider how these firms successfully attacked the Indian market.

## WINNING IN INDIA

Although some global brands have struggled entering the Indian market, others have succeeded by better understanding Indian consumers and tailoring their offerings accordingly. Hyundai became India’s second-largest carmaker by offering small, affordable, and fuel-efficient cars such as the $7,000 Santro. Nokia earned 58 percent market share by selling models specially made for the Indian market, such as its 1100 phone, which features a flashlight. Pepsi earned 24 percent market share in part because it was the first Western cola to feature Indian megacelebrities as spokespeople, including cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and actor Shahrukh Khan. LG outpaced competitors Whirlpool and Haier to $1 billion in annual sales by offering refrigerators and air conditioners that stood up better to the temperature extremes and power surges that characterize rural India. As the Indian market continues to grow and mature, catering to local tastes will become even more important for global brands seeking to compete there.⁴⁵

Heinz drew 20 percent of its corporate revenues from emerging markets in 2011—versus less than 5 percent just a few years before that—with a target of 30 percent by 2015. The company adheres to a “Three As” model for its emerging markets strategy and even put it on the cover of its annual report:⁴⁶

1. **Applicability** — Product must suit local culture. Heinz ketchup has a slightly sweet taste in the United States, but in certain European countries, it is available in hot, Mexican, and curry flavors. In the Philippines, it includes bananas as an ingredient. Ketchup usage varies by country, too. In Greece, it is poured on pasta, eggs, and cuts of meat. Koreans put ketchup on pizza.  
2. **Availability** — Product must be sold in channels that are relevant to the local population. In Indonesia, two-thirds of people buy food in tiny grocery stores or open-air markets, so Heinz must be there.  
3. **Affordability** — Product can’t be priced out of the target market’s range. To meet consumer budget constraints in emerging markets, Heinz employs different packaging sizes or recipes. In Indonesia, it sells billions of small packets of soy sauce for 3 cents apiece.

Firms are organizing themselves differently to address the opportunities presented by developing markets. With over half its sales coming from developing markets, Unilever reorganized into eight regional clusters, six of which were wholly or mainly made up of developing markets. When Kraft Foods broke into two companies, one focused primarily on the United States and slower-growing food categories, the other on developing markets and its faster-growing global snack business.⁴⁷

Procter & Gamble’s CEO has talked about shifting the company’s “center of gravity” toward Asia and Africa, where it is experiencing growth by targeting the “$2 a day” consumer based on average income. It is attempting to persuade half the men in India who use barbers to embrace at-home grooming, for instance. The “Women Against Lazy Stubble” campaign stresses the benefit Procter & Gamble emphasizes developing markets in its marketing, for example using well-known Bollywood actors in India to promote its Gillette razors.
