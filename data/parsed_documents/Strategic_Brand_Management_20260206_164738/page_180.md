# CLIF BAR

With very little advertising support, it grew in popularity through the years via word-of-mouth and PR. The CLIF Bar product line also grew to include dozens of flavors and varieties, some formulated especially for kids and women, and for energy, healthy snacking, and sports nutrition. Behind CLIF Bar products is a strong socially and environmentally responsible corporate message. The company is active in its local community and known for its passionate employees, who are allowed to do volunteer work on company time. It uses extensive organic ingredients, relies on biodiesel-powered vehicles, and supports the constructions of farmer- and Native American–owned wind farm through carbon offsets. Its nontraditional marketing activities focus on athletic sponsorships and public events. To broaden its appeal, it launched its “Meet the Moment™” campaign in the summer of 2011, in which participants provided stories and photos of inspirational athletic adventures. The integrated marketing campaign featured a fully interactive Web site and mobile applications for iPhone and Android systems. All these marketing efforts have paid off: CLIF Bar was the number one breakaway brand in a survey by *Forbes* magazine and Landor Associates measuring brand momentum from 2006 to 2009.

Integration and personalization, in particular, have become increasingly crucial factors in building and maintaining strong brands, as companies strive to use a broad set of tightly focused, personally meaningful marketing activities to win customers.

## INTEGRATING MARKETING

In today’s marketplace, there are many different means by which products and services and their corresponding marketing programs can build brand equity. Channel strategies, communication strategies, pricing strategies, and other marketing activities can all enhance or detract from brand equity.
