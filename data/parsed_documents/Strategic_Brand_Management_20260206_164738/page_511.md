In earlier chapters, we’ve considered how and why marketers (1) create brand portfolios to satisfy different market segments and (2) develop brand migration strategies to attract new and retain existing customers. This chapter looks at managing brand equity in different types of market segments. We’ll pay particular attention to international issues and global branding strategies.

Specifically, we begin by considering brand management issues over regional, demographic, and cultural market segments. Next, after reviewing the basic rationale for taking brands into new international markets, we consider the broader issues in developing a global brand strategy and look at some of the pros and cons of developing a standardized global marketing program.

In the remainder of the chapter, we concentrate on specific strategic and tactical issues in building global customer-based brand equity, organized around the concept of the “Ten Commandments of Global Branding.” To illustrate these guidelines, we’ll rely on global brand pioneers such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Procter & Gamble. Brand Focus 14.0 addresses branding issues in the exploding Chinese market.¹

## REGIONAL MARKET SEGMENTS

*Regionalization* seems to run counter to globalization. Marketers are interested in regional marketing today, however, because mass markets are splintering, computerized sales data from supermarket scanners can reveal regional pockets of sales strengths and weaknesses, and marketing communications make possible more focused targeting of consumer groups defined along virtually any lines.

A regionalization strategy can make a brand more relevant and appealing to any one individual. One study of retail stores found that a localization strategy could boost sales by one to three percentage points, and just 10–15 percent of inventory needed to be customized to get as much as 90 percent of the benefit. Tapping into several trends, Macy’s has made its brand simultaneously more local and more national.²

### MACY’S

Macy’s celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008, a milestone for any brand. Acquisitions, notably of the May Co. for over $11 billion, created a strong national chain of 825 stores, all under the iconic Macy’s brand name. At the same time, Macy’s recognizes the value of tailoring merchandise to suit local and regional tastes. With a strategy dubbed “My Macy’s,” the goal is to have 15 percent of merchandise in stores reflect local preferences, a high percentage given the 1.5–4 million different items typically stocked in each store. Using database technology, Macy’s can determine the volume, type, and color of sweaters to sell in different stores, for example, and when to replenish inventory. For Bellevue, Washington, whose local Asian population has grown from 4 percent to 23 percent over a 20-year period, the local Macy’s added more small and extra-small sizes. The company also needed to double the size of its sock department at the store, which store staff attributed to the forgetfulness of outsiders coming to visit Microsoft’s nearby offices. With a sizable African American customer base interested in men’s fashions, the Cumberland Mall store in Atlanta doubled the space devoted to men’s hats. Combined with a number of other marketing initiatives, Macy’s has outperformed its competition in recent years. In January 2012, after a stellar holiday season, CEO Terry Lundgren observed, 

> “We clearly saw the tangible progress of our My Macy’s localization, omnichannel integration of stores, online and mobile, and ‘MAGIC Selling’ [a customer engagement training program], which have been driving our business over the past two years.”³ Macy’s is adjusting its merchandise assortments to reflect local tastes, like expanding its hat department in hat-loving parts of Atlanta.
