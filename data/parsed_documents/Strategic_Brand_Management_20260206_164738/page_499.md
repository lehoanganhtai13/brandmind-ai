Attracting a new market segment can be deceptively difficult. Brands such as Gillette, Harley-Davidson, and ESPN have worked hard for years to find the right blend of products and advertising to make their masculine-image brands relevant and attractive to women. Creating marketing programs to appeal to women has become a priority of makers of products from cars to computers.

Marketers have also introduced programs targeted to different racial and ethnic groups, age groups, and income groups. These cultural market segments may require different messages, creative strategies, and media. They can be fickle, however, as Tommy Hilfiger discovered, forcing the brand to implement a back-to-basics revitalization strategy.

## TOMMY HILFIGER

One of the hottest fashion brands in the 1990s—when its worldwide sales peaked at $2 billion—Tommy Hilfiger was overexposed and struggling to stay relevant by the early 2000s. Other labels such as Phat Farm, FUBU, Sean John, and Ecko had drawn customers away by better executing the young urban, hip-hop style on which Hilfiger had built its 1990s success. Bloomingdale’s reduced the number of Hilfiger boutiques from 23 to 1, and Hilfiger closed all but 7 of its 44 own-brand specialty shops in 2003. To recover, the firm essentially cut all ties with the style that had made it popular—oversized apparel, even more oversized logos, and an edgy urban aura—even going so far as to remove the stylized U.S. flag logo from many of its clothing products. Hilfiger struck out in a new direction with classic preppy styles more closely associated with the brand’s original roots, although perhaps with a twist. One set of styles was inspired by the sun and surf, for instance. An exclusive distribution deal with Macy’s in 2008 allowed the company to focus its marketing efforts, and by 2010, the brand was being sold in 1,000 retail locations in 65 countries. Hilfiger tailored its offerings in many of these markets. For example, German consumers preferred darker colors, whereas Spanish consumers wanted lighter and brighter shades. In many overseas markets such as China, India, and parts of Europe, the brand was seen as high status. All these revitalizing efforts were validated when the Hilfiger brand was purchased for $3 billion by Phillips-Van Heusen.¹

A step out of fashion at times over the last decade, Tommy Hilfiger worked hard to restore the luster to its brand with updated new styles and marketing.

**Repositioning the Brand.** Regardless of the type of target market segment, repositioning the brand sometimes requires us to establish more compelling points-of-difference. At other times, we need to reposition a brand to establish a point-of-parity on some key image dimension.

A common problem for marketers of established, mature brands is to make them more contemporary by creating relevant usage situations, a more contemporary user profile, or a more modern brand personality. Heritage brands that have been around for years may be seen as trustworthy but also boring, uninteresting, and not that likable.
