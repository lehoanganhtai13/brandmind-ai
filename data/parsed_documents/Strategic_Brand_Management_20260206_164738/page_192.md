# PRICING STRATEGY

This section considers the different kinds of price perceptions that consumers might form, and different pricing strategies that the firm might adopt to build brand equity.

## Consumer Price Perceptions

The pricing strategy can dictate how consumers categorize the price of the brand (as low, medium, or high), and how firm or how flexible they think the price is, based on how deeply or how frequently it is discounted.

Consumers often rank brands according to price tiers in a category.<sup>43</sup> For example, Figure 5-3 shows the price tiers that resulted from a study of the ice cream market.<sup>44</sup> In that market, as the figure shows, there is also a relationship between price and quality. Within any price tier, there is a range of acceptable prices, called *price bands*, that indicate the flexibility and breadth marketers can adopt in pricing their brands within a tier. Some companies sell multiple brands to better compete in multiple categories. Figure 5-4 displays clothing offerings from Phillips Van Huesen that at one time covered a wide range of prices and corresponding retail outlets.<sup>45</sup>

Besides these descriptive “mean and variance” price perceptions, consumers may have price perceptions that have more inherent product meaning. In particular, in many categories, they may infer the quality of a product on the basis of its price and use perceived quality and price to arrive at an assessment of perceived value. Costs here are not restricted to the actual monetary price but may reflect opportunity costs of time, energy, and any psychological involvement in the decision that consumers might have.<sup>46</sup>

Consumer associations of perceived value are often an important factor in purchase decisions. Thus many marketers have adopted *value-based pricing strategies*—attempting to sell the right product at the right price—to better meet consumer wishes, as described in the next section.

In short, price has complex meaning and can play multiple roles to consumers. The Science of Branding 5-2 provides insight into how consumers perceive and process prices as part of their shopping behavior. Marketers need to understand all price perceptions that consumers have for a brand, to uncover quality and value inferences, and to discover any price premiums that exist.

This table presents a comparative analysis of ice cream brands, categorizing them by quality and consumer price. The primary classification is between "Commodity" and "Specialty" ice creams, with the latter further evaluated by a "Consumer Reports rating." Within this framework, brands are assessed across four quality tiers: Excellent, Very good, Good, and Fair. For each quality tier, specific brands are listed, with some tiers showing multiple brands and others only one or none. A secondary axis displays the "Consumer price, cents per 4-ounce serving," with a scale ranging from 0 to 50 cents, allowing for a direct comparison of the cost of different brands within their respective quality categories. The structure highlights how brands are positioned based on both perceived quality and economic value.
