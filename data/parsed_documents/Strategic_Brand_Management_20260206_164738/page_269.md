# BRANDING BRIEF 7-2

## Selling Brands the New Zealand Way

In November 2010, New Zealand was ranked as the third-strongest country brand in the world—ahead of the United States—by brand consultancy FutureBrand’s Country Brand Index. The ranking was a credit to the country’s remarkable qualities, but also to its concerted marketing program through the years.

Back in 1991, New Zealand began a branding initiative called “The New Zealand Way.” The key objectives of the New Zealand Way brand campaign were to reposition New Zealand to reflect its contemporary positioning and undertake a sustained campaign that could be a powerful force to benefit trade and tourism in the global marketplace. The innovative programme was owned and funded by the New Zealand Tourism Board, and New Zealand Trade & Enterprise (NZTE, the government’s official economic development Agency), working with the best businesses across tourism and trade, known as “Brand Partners.”

The New Zealand Way brand campaign promoted the country, its tourism and trade products and services, and its famous people, known as “Brand Ambassadors.”

From this research and focus groups, a fern logo was developed and intellectually protected as a new icon for New Zealand. It represented New Zealand’s green provenance and leveraged the well-known existing silver fern used by many sports teams (such as the rugby team the All Blacks) and some industries (such as Anchor butter). From research, a set of brand values were also agreed on by New Zealanders to inform the repositioning.

In 1999, a decision was made to develop a more focused campaign for tourism and Tourism New Zealand sharpened its destination global marketing with its campaign: “100% Pure New Zealand.” For the next decade the campaign combined a number of different activities but concentrating on the Internet, international media partnerships, events and close engagement and training with tourism operators. The campaign focused on building awareness of New Zealand as a unique holiday destination due its spectacular natural landscapes and fascinating culture and people. Purity was defined in a natural, wholesome way, but also in the genuineness and down-to-earth nature of the people.

Buoyed also by publicity from the highly popular *Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, which was filmed there, plus the profile from the America’s Cup which Tourism New Zealand cleverly used for promotion, the number of visitors to the country increased by 50% during this time. NZTE chose to focus its branding efforts on international business development reflecting emerging and relevant values for enterprise such as innovation, creativity, and integrity. This complemented the ongoing successes of the primary sector and New Zealand’s clean and green environment.

In 2011, the tag line for the tourism campaign was changed to “100% Pure You” with the subline, “It’s About Time.” The intent was to build on the prior campaign to target people who were actively considering New Zealand for a holiday vacation and to encourage them to travel soon. The focus was online, incorporating SEM, standard and rich media online ads, social media, and integrated partnership with the trade. The campaign was localized for each key market, for example, “It’s About Time” for the U.K., “Discover” for Germany, and “Revive” for Asia.

So that the right message is sent, the country home page (www.newzealand.com) directs visitors to either the tourism or business Web sites, depending on expressed preference.
