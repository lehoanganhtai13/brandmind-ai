Unfortunately, too little marketing attention is devoted to finding new ways for consumers to truly appreciate the advantages and capabilities of products. Perhaps in response to this oversight, one notable trend in marketing is the growing role of *aftermarketing*, that is, those marketing activities that occur *after* customer purchase. Innovative design, thorough testing, quality production, and effective communication—through mass customization or any other means—are without question the most important considerations in enhancing product consumption experiences that build brand equity.

In many cases, however, they may only be necessary and not sufficient conditions for brand success, and marketers may need to use other means to enhance consumption experiences. Here we consider the role of user manuals, customer service programs, and loyalty programs.

### User Manuals.

Instruction or user manuals for many products are too often an afterthought, put together by engineers who use overly technical terms and convoluted language. Online help forums put the consumer at the mercy of other equally ignorant users or so-called experts who may not understand or appreciate the obstacles the average consumer faces.

As a result, consumers’ initial product experiences may be frustrating or, even worse, unsuccessful. Even if consumers are able to figure out how to make the product perform its basic functions, they may not learn to appreciate some of its more advanced features, which are usually highly desirable and possibly unique to the brand.

To enhance consumers’ consumption experiences, marketers must develop user manuals or help features that clearly and comprehensively describe both what the product or service can do for consumers and how they can realize these benefits. With increasing globalization, writing easy-to-use instructions has become even more important because they often require translation into multiple languages.[^28] Manufacturers are spending more time designing and testing instructions to make them as user friendly as possible.

User manuals increasingly may need to appear in online and multimedia formats to most effectively demonstrate product functions and benefits. Intuit, makers of the Quicken personal finance management software package, routinely sends researchers home with first-time buyers to check that its software is easy to install and to identify any sources of problems that might arise. Corel software adopts a similar “Follow Me Home” strategy and also has “pizza parties” at the company where marketing, engineering, and quality assurance teams analyze the market research together, so that marketing does not just hand down conclusions to other departments.[^29]

### Customer Service Programs.

Aftermarketing, however, is more than the design and communication of product instructions. As one expert in the area notes, “The term ‘aftermarketing’ describes a necessary new mind-set that reminds businesses of the importance of building a lasting relationship with customers, to extend their lifetimes. It also points to the crucial need to better balance the allocation of marketing funds between conquest activities (like advertising) and retention activities (like customer communication programs).”[^30]

Creating stronger ties with consumers can be as simple as creating a well-designed customer service department. Research by Accenture in 2010 found that two in three customers switched companies in the past year due to poor customer service.[^31] In the auto industry, after-sales service from the dealer is a critical determinant of loyalty and repeat buying of a brand. Routine maintenance and unplanned repairs are an opportunity for dealers to strengthen their ties with customers.[^32]

Aftermarketing can include the sale of complementary products that help make up a system or in any other way enhance the value of the core product. Printer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard derive much of their revenue from high-margin postpurchase items such as inkjet cartridges, laser toner cartridges, and paper specially designed for PC printers. The average owner of a home PC printer spends much more on consumables over the lifetime of the machine than on the machine itself.[^33]

Aftermarketing can be an important determinant of profitability. For example, roughly three-quarters of revenue for aerospace and defense providers comes from aftermarket support and related sales. Aftermarket sales are strongest when customers are locked in to buying from the company that sold them the primary product due to service contracts, proprietary technology or patents, or unique service expertise.[^34] HP makes much more money selling printer cartridges than from selling the printer itself.
