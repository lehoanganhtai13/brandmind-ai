## Greater Loyalty and Less Vulnerability to Competitive Marketing Actions and Crises

This influence may be especially apparent with difficult-to-assess “experience” goods and as the uniqueness of brand associations increases. In addition, familiarity with a brand has been shown to increase consumer confidence, attitude toward the brand, and purchase intention, and to mitigate the negative impact of a poor trial experience.

For these and other reasons, one characteristic of brands with a great deal of equity is that consumers feel great loyalty to them. Some top brands have been market leaders for years despite significant changes in both consumer attitudes and competitive activity over time. Through it all, consumers have valued these brands enough to stick with them and reject the overtures of competitors, creating a steady stream of revenues for the firm. Research also shows that brands with large market shares are more likely to have more loyal customers than brands with small market shares, a phenomenon called **double jeopardy**. One study found that brand equity was strongly correlated (.75) with subsequent market share and profitability.

A brand with a positive brand image also is more likely to successfully weather a brand crisis or downturn in the brand’s fortunes. Perhaps the most compelling example is Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) Tylenol brand. Brand Focus 11.0 describes how J&J contended with a tragic product-tampering episode in the early 1980s. Despite seeing its market share drop from 37 percent to almost zero overnight and fearing Tylenol would be written off as a brand with no future, J&J was able to regain virtually all lost market share for the brand through its skillful handling of the crisis and a good deal of brand equity.

The lesson is that effective handling of a marketing crisis requires swift and sincere action, an immediate admission that something has gone wrong, and assurance that an effective remedy will be put in place. The greater the brand equity, the more likely that these statements will be credible enough to keep customers understanding and patient as the firm sets out to solve the crisis. Without some underlying brand equity, however, even the best-laid plans for recovery may fall short with a suspicious or uninformed public. Finally, even absent a crisis, a strong brand offers protection in a marketing downturn or when the brand’s fortunes fall.

## Larger Margins

Brands with positive customer-based brand equity can command a price premium. Moreover, consumers should also have a fairly inelastic response to price increases and elastic responses to price decreases or discounts for the brand over time. Consistent with this reasoning, research has shown that consumers loyal to a brand are less likely to switch in the face of price increases and more likely to increase the quantity of the brand purchased in the face of price decreases. In a competitive sense, brand leaders draw a disproportionate amount of share from smaller-share competitors. At the same time, market leaders are relatively immune to price competition from these small-share brands.

In a classic early study, Intelliquest explored the role of brand name and price in the decision purchase of business computer buyers. Survey respondents were asked, “What is the incremental dollar value you would be willing to pay over a ‘no-name’ clone computer brand?” IBM commanded the greatest price premium, followed by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. Some brands had negative brand equity; they actually received negative numbers. Clearly, according to this study, brands had specific meaning in the personal computer market that consumers valued and were willing to pay for.

## Greater Trade Cooperation and Support

Wholesalers, retailers, and other middlemen in the distribution channel play an important role in the selling of many products. Their activities can thus facilitate or inhibit the success of the brand. If a brand has a positive image, retailers and other middlemen are more likely to respond to the wishes of consumers and actively promote and sell the brand. Channel members are also less likely to require any marketing push from the manufacturer and will be more receptive to manufacturers’ suggestions to stock, reorder, and display the brand, as well as to pass through trade promotions, demand smaller slotting allowances, give more favorable shelf space or position, and so on. Given that many consumer decisions are made in the store, the possibility of additional marketing push by retailers is important.

## Increased Marketing Communication Effectiveness

A host of advertising and communication benefits may result from creating awareness of and a positive image for a brand. One well-established view of consumer response to marketing communications is the hierarchy of effects models. These models assume that consumers move through a series of stages or mental states on the basis of marketing communications—for example, exposure to, attention to, comprehension of, yielding to, retention of, and behaving on the basis of a marketing communication.

A brand with a great deal of equity already has created some knowledge structures in consumers’ minds, increasing the likelihood that consumers will pass through various stages of the hierarchy. For example, consider the effects of a positive brand image on the persuasive ability of advertising: Consumers may be more likely to notice an ad, may more easily learn about the brand and form favorable opinions, and may retain and act on these beliefs over time.

Familiar, well-liked brands are less susceptible to “interference” and confusion from competitive ads, are more responsive to creative strategies such as humor appeals, and are less vulnerable to negative reactions due to concentrated repetition schedules. In addition, panel diary members who were highly loyal to a brand increased purchases when advertising for the brand increased. Other advantages associated with more advertising include increased likelihood of being the focus of attention and increased “brand interest.”

Because strong brand associations exist, lower levels of repetition may be necessary. For example, in a classic study of advertising weights, Anheuser-Busch ran a carefully conducted field experiment in which it varied the amount of Budweiser advertising shown to consumers in different matched test markets. Seven different advertising expenditure levels were tested, representing increases and decreases from the previous advertising expenditure levels: minus 100 percent (no advertising), minus 50 percent, 0 percent (same level), plus 50 percent, plus 100 percent (double the level of advertising), plus 150 percent, and plus 200 percent.
