## Indirect Competition.

Research on noncomparable alternatives suggests that even if a brand does not face direct competition in its product category, and thus does not share performance-related attributes with other brands, it can still share more abstract associations and face indirect competition in a more broadly defined product category.³⁶

Competition often occurs at the benefit level rather than the attribute level. Thus, a luxury good with a strong hedonic benefit like stereo equipment may compete as much with a vacation as with other durable goods like furniture. A maker of educational software products may be implicitly competing with all other forms of education and entertainment, such as books, videos, television, and magazines. For these reasons, branding principles are now being used to market a number of different categories as a whole—for example, banks, furniture, carpets, bowling, and trains, to name just a few.

Unfortunately, many firms narrowly define competition and fail to recognize the most compelling threats and opportunities. For example, sales in the apparel industry often have been stagnant in recent years as consumers have decided to spend on home furnishings, electronics, and other products that better suit their lifestyle.³⁷ Leading clothing makers may be better off considering the points-of-differences of their offerings not so much against other clothing labels as against other discretionary purchases.

As Chapter 3 outlines, products are often organized in consumers’ minds in a hierarchical fashion, meaning that marketers can define competition at a number of different levels. Take Fresca, a grapefruit-flavored soft drink, as an example: At the product type level, it competes with non-cola-flavored soft drinks; at the product category level, it competes with all soft drinks; and at the product class level, it competes with all beverages.

## Multiple Frames of Reference.

It is not uncommon for a brand to identify more than one frame of reference. This may be the result of broader category competition or the intended future growth of a brand, or it can occur when the same function can be performed by different types of products. For example, Canon EOS Rebel digital cameras compete with digital cameras from Nikon, Kodak, and others, but also with photo-taking cell phones. Their advantages against cell phones—such as easy photo sharing on social networks like Facebook or the ability to shoot high-definition video for sharing—would not necessarily be an advantage at all against other digital camera brands.³⁸

As another example, Starbucks can define very distinct sets of competitors, which would suggest very different POPs and PODs as a result:

1. *Quick-serve restaurants and convenience shops (McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts).* Intended PODs might be quality, image, experience, and variety; intended POPs might be convenience and value.  
2. *Supermarket brands for home consumption (Nescafé and Folger’s).* Intended PODs might be quality, image, experience, variety, and freshness; intended POPs might be convenience and value.  
3. *Local cafés.* Intended PODs might be convenience and service quality; intended POPs might be quality, variety, price, and community.

Note that some POPs and PODs are shared across competitors; others are unique to a particular competitor. Under such circumstances, marketers have to decide what to do. There are two main options. Ideally, a robust positioning could be developed that would be effective across the multiple frames somehow. If not, then it is necessary to prioritize and choose the most relevant set of competitors to serve as the competitive frame. One thing that is crucial though is to be careful to not try to be all things to all people—that typically leads to ineffective “lowest common denominator” positioning.

Finally, note that if there are many competitors in different categories or subcategories, it may be useful to either develop the positioning at the categorical level for all relevant categories (“quick-serve restaurants” or “supermarket take-home coffee” for Starbucks) or with an exemplar from each category (McDonald’s or Nescafé for Starbucks).

## Points-of-Parity and Points-of-Difference

The target and competitive frame of reference chosen will dictate the breadth of brand awareness and the situations and types of cues that should become closely related to the brand. Once marketers have fixed the appropriate competitive frame of reference for positioning by defining the customer target market and the nature of competition, they can define the basis of the positioning itself.
