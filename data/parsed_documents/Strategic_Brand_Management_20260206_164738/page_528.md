PepsiCo, on the other hand, sold off some of its bottling investments during this time. Despite investing in expensive ad campaigns and diversifying into restaurants and snack foods, PepsiCo saw its global fortunes sag relative to Coca-Cola and has renewed its efforts in the years since.

As in domestic markets, firms will often want to blend push and pull strategies internationally to build brand equity. Sometimes companies mistakenly adapt strategies that were critical factors to success, only to discover that they erode the brand’s competitive advantage.

### DELL

Dell Computer initially abandoned its direct distribution strategy in Europe and instead decided to establish a traditional retailer network through existing channels. The end result was a paltry 2.5 percent market share, and the company lost money for the first time ever in 1994. Ignoring critics who claimed that a direct distribution model would never work in Europe, Dell revamped its direct approach and relaunched its personal computer line with a new management team to execute the direct model the company had pioneered in the United States. Between 1999 and 2004, Dell’s sales in Europe grew at an average rate of 19 percent annually, substantially outpacing other competitors in the industry. Later in the decade, however, sales slumped as the PC market stagnated all over the world. Dell now must reinvent its product strategy in Europe and elsewhere, much as it did its distribution strategy so many years before.⁴¹

### Pricing Strategy.

When it comes to designing a global pricing strategy, the value-pricing principle from Chapter 5 still generally applies. Marketers need to understand in each country what consumer perceptions of the value of the brand are, their willingness to pay, and their elasticities with respect to price changes. Sometimes differences in these considerations permit differences in pricing strategies. Brands such as Levi’s, Heineken, and Perrier have been able to command a much higher price outside their domestic market because in other countries they have a distinctly different brand image—and thus sources of brand equity—that consumers value. Differences in distribution structures, competitive positions, and tax and exchange rates also may justify price differences.

But setting drastically different prices across countries can be difficult.⁴² Pressures for international price alignment have arisen, in part because of the increasing numbers of legitimate imports and exports and the ability of retailers and suppliers to exploit price differences through “gray imports” across borders. This problem is especially acute in Europe, where price differences are often large (prices of identical car models may vary by 30–40 percent) and ample opportunity exists to ship or shop across national boundaries.

Hermann Simon, a German expert on pricing, recommends creating an international “price corridor” that takes into account both the inherent differences between countries and alignment pressures. Specifically, the corridor is calculated by company headquarters and its country subsidiaries by considering market data for the individual countries, price elasticities in the countries, parallel imports resulting from price differentials, currency exchange rates, costs in countries and arbitrage costs between them, and data on competition and distribution. No country is then allowed to set its price outside the corridor: countries with lower prices have to raise them, and countries with higher prices have to lower them. Another possible strategy suggested by Simon is to introduce different brands in high-price, high-income countries and in low-price, low-income countries, depending on the relative cost trade-offs of standardization versus customization.⁴³

In Asia, many U.S. brands command hefty premiums over inferior home-grown competitors because consumers in these countries strongly associate the United States with high-quality consumer products. In assessing the viability of Asian markets, marketers look at average income but also consider the distribution of incomes, because the consumer population is so large. For example, although the average annual income in India may be less than $1,000, some 300 million people can still afford the same types of products that might be sold to middle-class Europeans. In China, Gillette introduced Oral-B toothbrushes at 90 cents even though locally produced toothbrushes sold at 19 cents. Gillette’s reasoning was that even if it only gained 10 percent of the Chinese market, it still would sell more toothbrushes there than it is currently selling in the U.S. market.
