# Branding Brief 10-1

## Beauty Is in the Eye of the Beholder

In making acquisitions, a company has to determine what it feels the acquired brands are worth. In some instances, the hoped-for brand value has failed to materialize, serving as a reminder that the value of a brand is partly a function of what you do with it. The booming business environment of the 1990s witnessed many such failures.

A classic example is Quaker Oats’s $1.7 billion acquisition of Snapple in 1994. Snapple had become a popular national brand through powerful grassroots marketing and a willingness to distribute to small outlets and convenience stores. Quaker changed Snapple’s ad campaign—abandoning the rotund and immensely popular Snapple Lady—and revamped its distribution system. Quaker also changed the packaging by updating the label and putting Snapple in 64-ounce bottles, moves that did not sit well with loyal customers. The results were disastrous: Snapple began losing money and market share, allowing a host of competitors to move in. Unable to revive the foundering brand, Quaker sold the company in 1997 for $300 million to Triarc, which owned other beverages such as Royal Crown Cola and Diet Rite.

Another unsuccessful acquisition occurred when Quality Dining bought Bruegger’s Bagels in 1996 with $142 million in stock. Within one year, Quality Dining agreed to sell the bagel chain back to its original owners for $50 million after taking a $203 million charge on the acquisition. Experts blamed an overly ambitious expansion strategy. Quality Dining planned to expand to 2,000 stores within four years, despite the fact that before the acquisition, Bruegger’s had posted two consecutive annual losses due to its expansion to 339 stores. The new ownership also set the lofty goal of entering the top 60 domestic markets, which limited the amount of advertising and promotional support each market received. As Bruegger’s fortunes turned, competitor Einstein/Noah Bagel overtook the company as the market leader in the United States. One franchisee commented, “[Quality Dining] would have had to stay up pretty late at night to screw up anything more than they did.”

More recently, despite much success with its Ford brand, Ford Motor Company could never seem to find the right formula for the overseas acquisitions that made up its Premier Automotive Group collection. The company sold the Jaguar and Land Rover brands to India’s Tata Motors in March 2008 for $1.7 billion—roughly a third of the price it had paid for the two luxury brands ($2.5 billion in 1989 and $2.7 billion in 2000, respectively). After paying $6.5 billion for Volvo in 1999, Ford sold it to China’s Geely for $1.5 billion in 2010. Ford’s decision was motivated by a lack of success with its luxury brands and a desire to focus on its more promising Ford brand.

In all these cases, despite the best of intentions, brands were sold with an implicit assumption that they could be more profitably marketed by someone else.
