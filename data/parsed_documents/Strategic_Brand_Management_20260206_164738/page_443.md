# Can Encounter Retailer Resistance

Own-brand or private-label goods also continue to grow as a percentage of total grocery sales. Many brands now come in a multitude of different forms. For example, Campbell’s has introduced a number of different lines of soup—including Condensed, Home Cookin’, Chunky, Healthy Request, Select, Simply Home, Ready-to-Serve Classic, and portable Soup at Hand—and offers more than 100 flavors in all.

As a result, it has become virtually impossible for a grocery store or supermarket to offer all the different varieties available across all the different brands in any one product category. Moreover, retailers often feel that many line extensions are merely “me-too” products that duplicate existing brands in a product category and should not be stocked even if there is space. Walmart, the biggest retailer in the United States, attempts to stock the items that sell best, dropping as many as 20 percent of slow-moving items from its shelves annually.⁽²⁴⁾

Attacking brand proliferation, an influential Food Marketing Institute (FMI) study examined the effects of stock-keeping unit (SKU) reduction in six test categories (cereal, toothpaste, salad dressing, toilet tissue, spaghetti sauce, and pet food). The study showed that retailers could reduce their SKUs by 5–25 percent without hurting sales or consumer perceptions of the variety offered by their stores. The FMI “product variety” study recommended that retailers systematically identify duplicated and slow-moving items and eliminate them to maximize profitability.⁽²⁵⁾

Many large packaged food brands took this advice to heart and began trimming their product lines in order to focus on their top-selling brands. Heinz culled 40 percent of its items over a two-year period, a move that yielded an operating income increase of 18 percent. General Mills reduced the number of products it sells by 20 percent, while Hershey Foods made similar cuts.⁽²⁶⁾ Additional academic research has shed light on how to reduce brand proliferation, as summarized in *The Science of Branding* 12-1.

# Can Fail and Hurt Parent Brand Image

The worst possible scenario for an extension is not only to fail, but to harm the parent brand image in the process. Unfortunately, these negative feedback effects can sometimes happen.

Consider General Motors’ experience with the Cadillac Cimarron. This model, introduced in the early 1980s, was a “relative” of models in other GM lines, such as the Pontiac 2000 and Chevrolet Cavalier. The target market was less-affluent buyers who were seeking a small luxury car but could not really afford a full-size Cadillac. Not only was the Cadillac Cimarron unsuccessful at generating new sales with this market segment, but existing Cadillac owners hated it. They felt it was inconsistent with the large size and prestige image they expected from Cadillac. As a result, Cadillac sales dropped significantly in the mid-1980s. Looking back, one GM executive offered the following insights:⁽²⁷⁾

> The decision was made purely on the basis of short-sighted profit and financial analysis, with no accounting for its effect on long-run customer loyalty or, if you will, equity. A typical financial analysis would argue that the Cimarron will rarely steal sales from Cadillac’s larger cars, so any sale would be one that we wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. The people who were most concerned with such long-range issues raised serious objections but the bean counters said, “Oh no, we’ll get this many dollars for every model sold.” There was no thinking about brand equity. We paid for the Cimarron down the road. Everyone now realizes that using the model to extend the name was a horrible mistake.

Even if an extension initially succeeds, by linking the brand to multiple products, the firm increases the risk that an unexpected problem or even a tragedy with one product in the brand family can tarnish the image of some or all the remaining products. The Audi is a classic example.
