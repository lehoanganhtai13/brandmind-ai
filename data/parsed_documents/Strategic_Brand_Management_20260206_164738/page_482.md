# MICHELOB

A brand that failed to turn around sales while enduring numerous repositionings is Michelob, an upscale, superpremium beer with a distinctive teardrop bottle designed in part to stand out in smoky bars and restaurants. In the 1970s, Michelob ran ads featuring successful young professionals that confidently proclaimed, “Where You’re Going, It’s Michelob.” Moving away from the strong user imagery of that campaign, the next one focused on leisure situations and trumpeted, “Weekends Were Made for Michelob.” Later, to bolster sagging sales, the ad theme switched to “Put a Little Weekend in Your Week.” In the mid-1980s, the firm launched yet another campaign—featuring laid-back rock music and stylish shots of beautiful people—that proclaimed “The Night Belongs to Michelob.” None of these campaigns could stop a sales slide from a peak of 8.1 million barrels in 1980 to 1.8 million in 1998. Leaving no stone unturned, the next ad campaign, “Some Days Are Better Than Others,” explained to consumers that “A Special Day Requires a Special Beer,” which later became “Some Days Were Made for Michelob.” Pity the poor consumer! After so many different messages, people could hardly be blamed if they wondered exactly when they were supposed to drink the beer. Meanwhile, sales performance continued to suffer. The 2000s saw the brand concentrate on its Michelob Ultra extension, although the company did try to go after younger, import-drinking consumers in 2002 with hip, sexy ads. By the end of the decade, the brand had decided to return to its 100 percent malt roots—one of the defining characteristics of the exploding craft beer category—to chase after quality-conscious consumers, in yet another repositioning.⁴

Michelob has been repositioned so many times through the years, consumers could hardly be blamed for not knowing when (and why) they should drink the beer.

## Consistency and Change.

Being consistent does not mean, however, that marketers should avoid making any changes in the marketing program. On the contrary, managing brand equity with consistency may require making numerous tactical shifts and changes in order to maintain the strategic thrust and direction of the brand. The most effective tactics for a particular brand at any one time can certainly vary. Prices may move up or down, product features may be added or dropped, ad campaigns may employ different creative strategies and slogans, and different brand extensions may be introduced or withdrawn to create the same desired knowledge structures in consumers’ minds.

Nevertheless, the strategic positioning of many leading brands has been kept remarkably uniform over time by the retention of key elements of the marketing program and the preservation of the brand meaning. In fact, many brands have kept a key creative element in their marketing communication programs over the years and, as a result, have effectively created some “advertising equity.” For example, Jack Daniels bourbon whiskey has stuck with rural scenes of its Tennessee home and the slogan “Charcoal Mellowed Drop by Drop” for literally decades.

As *The Science of Branding* 13-1 describes, brands sometimes return to their roots to remind existing or lapsed customers or to attract new ones. Such efforts to refresh awareness obviously can make sense. At the same time, marketers should be sure that these old advertising elements or marketing appeals have enduring meaning with older consumers but are also relevant to younger consumers. They should examine the entire marketing program to determine which elements are making a strong contribution to brand equity and must therefore be protected.
