Deciding on a positioning requires determining a frame of reference (by identifying the target market and the nature of competition), the optimal points-of-parity and points-of-difference brand associations, and an overall brand mantra as a summary. First, marketers need to understand consumer behavior and the consideration sets that consumers adopt in making brand choices. After establishing this frame of reference, they can then turn to identifying the best possible points-of-parity and points-of-difference.

Points-of-difference are those associations that are unique to the brand, strongly held, and favorably evaluated by consumers. Marketers should find points-of-difference associations that are strong, favorable, and unique based on desirability, deliverability, and differentiation considerations, as well as the resulting anticipated levels of sales and costs that might be expected with achieving those points-of-difference.

Points-of-parity, on the other hand, are those associations that are not necessarily unique to the brand but may in fact be shared with other brands. Category points-of-parity associations are necessary to being a legitimate and credible product offering within a certain category. Competitive points-of-parity associations negate competitors’ points-of-differences. Correlational points-of-parity negate any possible disadvantages or negatives that might also arise from a point-of-difference.

Finally, a brand mantra is an articulation of the “heart and soul” of the brand, a three- to five-word phrase that captures the irrefutable essence or spirit of the brand positioning and brand values. Its purpose is to ensure that all employees and all external marketing partners understand what the brand is, most fundamentally, in order to represent it with consumers.

The choice of these four ingredients determines the brand positioning and the desired brand knowledge structures.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Apply the categorization model to a product category other than beverages. How do consumers make decisions whether or not to buy the product, and how do they arrive at their final brand decision? What are the implications for brand equity management for the brands in the category? How does it affect positioning, for example?  
2. Pick a category basically dominated by two main brands. Evaluate the positioning of each brand. Who are their target markets? What are their main points-of-parity and points-of-difference? Have they defined their positioning correctly? How might it be improved?  
3. Consider a book store in your area. What competitive frames of reference does it face? What are the implications of those frames of reference for its positioning?  
4. Can you think of any negatively correlated attributes and benefits other than those listed in Figure 2-6? Can you think of any other strategies to deal with negatively correlated attributes and benefits?  
5. What do you think of Naomi Klein’s positions as espoused in *No Logos*? How would you respond to her propositions? Do you agree or disagree about her beliefs on the growth of corporate power?

# The Marketing Advantages of Strong Brands

Customer-based brand equity occurs when consumer response to marketing activity differs when consumers know the brand and when they do not. How that response differs will depend on the level of brand awareness and how favorably and uniquely consumers evaluate brand associations, as well as the particular marketing activity under consideration.

A number of benefits can result from a strong brand, both in terms of greater revenue and lower costs.<sup>60</sup> For example, one marketing expert categorizes the factors creating financial value for strong brands into two categories: factors related to growth (a brand’s ability to attract new customers, resist competitive activity, introduce line extensions, and cross international Research shows that different types of brand associations—if favorable—can affect consumer product evaluations, perceptions of quality, and purchase rates.
