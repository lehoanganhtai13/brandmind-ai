Recall the problems encountered by Coca-Cola from its overreliance on blind taste tests, described in Branding Brief 1-1.

No single number or measure fully captures brand equity.<sup>45</sup> Rather, we should think of brand equity as a multidimensional concept that depends on what knowledge structures are present in the minds of consumers, and what actions a firm takes to capitalize on the potential that these knowledge structures offer.

There are many different sources of, and outcomes from, brand equity, depending on the marketers’ skill and ingenuity. Firms may be more or less able to maximize the potential value of a brand according to the type and nature of their marketing activities. As Wharton’s Peter Fader says:

> The actual value of a brand depends on its fit with buyer’s corporate structure and other assets. If the acquiring company has manufacturing or distribution capabilities that are synergistic with the brand, then it might be worth paying a lot of money for it. Paul Feldwick, a British executive, makes the analogy between brands and properties on the Monopoly game board. You’re willing to pay a lot more for Marvin Gardens if you already own Atlantic and Ventnor Avenues!<sup>46</sup>

The customer-based brand equity framework therefore emphasizes employing a range of research measures and methods to fully capture the multiple potential sources and outcomes of brand equity.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Choose a product. Conduct a branded and unbranded experiment. What do you learn about the equity of the brands in that product class?  
2. Can you identify any other advantages or disadvantages of the comparative methods?  
3. Pick a brand and conduct an analysis similar to that done with the Planters brand. What do you learn about its extendability as a result?  
4. What do you think of the Interbrand methodology? What do you see as its main advantages and disadvantages?  
5. How do you think Young & Rubicam’s BrandAsset Valuator relates to the Interbrand methodology (see Brand Focus 9.0)? What do you see as its main advantages and disadvantages?

## Branding and Finance

Marketers increasingly must be able to quantify their activities directly or indirectly in financial terms. One important topic that has received increasing academic interest is the relationship between brand equity and brand strategies and stock market information and performance. Another important topic is the accounting implications of branding. We review issues around these two topics in this appendix.

### Stock Market Reactions

Several researchers have studied how the stock market reacts to the brand equity and marketing activities for companies and products.

**Brand Equity.** In a classic study, David Aaker and Robert Jacobson examined the association between yearly stock return and yearly brand changes (as measured by EquiTrend’s perceived quality rating of brand equity) for 34 companies during the years 1989–1992.<sup>47</sup> They also compared the accompanying changes in current-term return on investment (ROI).

They found that, as expected, stock market return was positively related to changes in ROI. Interestingly, they also uncovered a strong positive relationship between brand equity and stock return. Firms that experienced the largest gains in brand equity saw their stock return average 30 percent. Conversely, those firms with the largest losses in brand equity saw stock return average a negative 10 percent. The researchers concluded that investors can and do learn about changes in brand equity––not necessarily through EquiTrend studies (which may have little exposure to the financial community) but by learning about a company’s plans and programs.<sup>48</sup>

In a follow-up study, using data for firms in the computer industry in the 1990s, Aaker and Jacobson found that changes in brand attitude were associated contemporaneously with stock return and led accounting financial performance.<sup>49</sup> They also found five factors (new products, product problems, competitor actions, changes in top management, and legal actions) that were associated with significant changes in brand attitudes.
