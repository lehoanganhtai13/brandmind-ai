## Scoring Brand Extensions

When identifying and evaluating brand extensions, it is helpful to have a summary tool to judge their viability. The following checklist can provide some guidance:

1. Does the parent brand have strong equity?  
2. Is there a strong basis of extension fit?  
3. Will the extension have necessary points-of-parity and points-of-difference?  
4. How can marketing programs enhance extension equity?  
5. What implications will the extension have on parent brand equity and profitability?  
6. How should feedback effects best be managed?  

It’s also useful to employ more systematic analysis of proposed extensions. The Brand Extendibility Scorecard is designed to help marketers conduct thoughtful, thorough analysis of brand extensions. Like any marketing tool or framework, however, it serves as a means to an end and is designed to inform decision making, not to provide black-and-white “go or no-go” decisions.

Figure 12-8 contains the Brand Extendibility Scorecard. Three of its four main criteria follow the classic “3 Cs” perspectives—the consumer, company, and competitive point of view—to judge brand positioning. The fourth criterion is unique to the Scorecard and measures brand equity feedback.

Within each criterion, there are two major factors and one minor factor. Major factors are scored on a 10-point scale, minor factors on a 5-point scale. Maximum points are awarded if the extension candidate is clearly ideal on that factor, using either company or industry measures.

When we are scoring extensions, relative performance is important as absolute performance. Ranking extension candidates by their scores can provide a clear sense of priority, but we may also want to set cutoff points to guide decisions about potential extensions, perhaps by first scoring recent successful and unsuccessful extensions for the brand and even for competitors. This step also allows the marketing team to become more familiar with the scorecard.
