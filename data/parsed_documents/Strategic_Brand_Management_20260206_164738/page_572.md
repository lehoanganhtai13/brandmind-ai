* Competence: Knowledge and skill of employees  
* Trustworthiness: Believability and honesty (ability to convey trust and confidence)  
* Empathy: Caring, individualized attention  
* Courtesy: Friendliness of customer contact  
* Communication: Keeping customers informed in language they can understand and listening to what they say  

Thus, service quality perceptions depend on a number of specific associations that vary in how directly they relate to the actual service experience.<sup>14</sup>  
*Employ a full range of brand elements to enhance brand recall and signal more tangible aspects of the brand.* Because consumers often make service decisions away from the actual service location itself (say, at home or at work), brand recall, preferably aided by an easy-to-remember and easy-to-pronounce brand name, becomes critically important. Product packaging is not really relevant, although the physical facilities of the service provider—primary and secondary signage, environmental design and reception area, apparel, collateral material—serve as external “packaging” for the service.  

Other brand elements—logos, symbols, characters, and slogans—must pick up the slack and complement the brand name to build awareness and image. These elements can help make the service and some of its key benefits more tangible—for example, the “friendly skies” of United, the “good hands” of Allstate, and the “bullish” nature of Merrill Lynch. All aspects of the service delivery process can be branded, which is why Allied Moving Lines is concerned about the appearance of its drivers and laborers, why UPS has developed such strong equity with the brown color of its trucks, and why Doubletree hotels offer warm, fresh-baked cookies to symbolize the company’s caring and friendliness.  

*Create and communicate strong organizational associations.* Organizational associations are particularly important in creating perceptions of service quality. Relevant associations are company credibility and the perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and likability of the people who make up the organization and provide the service.  

*Design communication programs that augment consumers’ service encounters and experiences.* Service firms must design marketing communications so consumers learn more about the brand than what they glean from service encounters alone. Advertising, direct mail, and online communications are particularly effective at helping develop the brand personality.  

The communication programs should be fully integrated and evolve over time. Citigroup walked away from a strong credibility position for its retail brand when it dropped its “Citi Never Sleeps” ad campaign, although it later returned to it during some tough economic times.  

*Establish a brand hierarchy by creating distinct family brands or individual brands as well as meaningful ingredient brands.* Finally, services also must consider developing a brand hierarchy and brand portfolio that allow them to position and target different market segments on the basis of price and quality. Such vertical extensions often require sub-branding strategies that combine the corporate name with an individual brand name or modifier. Delta Airlines brands its business class service as Business Elite, its frequent flier program as SkyMiles, and its short-haul East Coast flights as Delta Shuttle. Hilton Hotel introduced Hilton Garden Inns to target budget-conscious business travelers and compete with the popular Courtyard by Marriott chain.  

## Retailers  

Chapters 5 and 7 reviewed how retailers and other channel intermediaries can affect the brand equity of the products they sell, as well as creating their own brand equity, by establishing awareness and associations to their product assortment (breadth and depth), pricing and credit policy, and quality of service. Walmart has made itself a top U.S. retail brand by becoming the low-price, high-value provider of a host of everyday consumer products. Following are several guidelines relevant for building brand equity for a retailer (see Figure 15-15).  

*Create a brand hierarchy by branding the store as a whole, as well as individual departments, classes of service, or any other noteworthy aspects of the retail service or shopping experience.* Establishing a brand hierarchy helps create synergies in brand development, including for retailers. Walmart introduced Sam’s Club to tap into the growing discount or warehouse retail market. Similarly, individual departments can take on unique sets of associations that appeal to a particular target market. Nordstrom has a number of clothing departments, each designed with distinct images and positions, such as t.b.d. for the latest women’s trends, BP for teen girls, and Encore for plus-size women. The retailer may brand these departments or even use them as “ingredient brands,” designed and supported by a national manufacturer (like Polo shops in major department stores, which sell only that Ralph Lauren brand).  

*Enhance manufacturer’s brand equity.* Retailers should exploit as much as possible the brand equity of the manufacturer brands they sell, by communicating and demonstrating their points-of-difference and other strong, favorable, and unique

1. Create a brand hierarchy by branding the store as a whole, as well as individual departments, classes of service, or any other aspects of the retail service or shopping experience.  
2. Enhance manufacturers’ brand equity by communicating and demonstrating their points-of-difference and other strong, favorable, and unique brand associations.  
3. Establish brand equity at all levels of the brand hierarchy by offering added value in the selection, purchase, or delivery of product offerings.  
4. Create multichannel shopping experiences.  
5. Avoid overbranding.
