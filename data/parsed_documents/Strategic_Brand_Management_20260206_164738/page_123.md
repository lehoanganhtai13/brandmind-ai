# BRANDING BRIEF 3-1

## Building Brand Communities

**Apple**  
Apple encourages owners of its computers to form local Apple user groups. Over 800 groups exist worldwide, ranging in size from fewer than 25 members to over 1,000 members. Many groups offer monthly meetings, an informative newsletter, member discounts, special interest groups, classes, and one-on-one support. Larger groups offer extensive training programs, computer labs, and resource libraries. The user groups provide Apple owners with opportunities to learn more about their computers, share ideas, friendships with fellow Apple users, as well as sponsor special activities and events and perform community service. A visit to Apple’s Web site helps customers find nearby user groups.

**Harley-Davidson**  
The world-famous motorcycle company sponsors the Harley Owners Group (HOG), which by 2011 had 1,200,000 members in chapter groups all over the world sharing a very simple mission, “To Ride and Have Fun.” The first-time buyer of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle gets a free one-year membership. HOG benefits include a magazine called *Hog Tales*, a touring handbook, emergency road service, a specially designed insurance program, theft reward service, discount hotel rates, and a Fly & Ride program enabling members to rent Harleys while on vacation. The company also maintains an extensive Web site devoted to HOG, which includes information about club chapters and events and features a special members-only section.

**Jeep**  
In addition to joining the hundreds of local Jeep enthusiast clubs throughout the world, Jeep owners can convene with their vehicles in wilderness areas across the United States as part of the company’s official Jeep Jamborees and Jeep Rocks and Road. A tradition since 1953, Jeep Jamborees bring Jeep owners and their families together for two-day off-road adventures in 30 different locations throughout the United States from spring through autumn each year. Trails and obstacles are rated on a 1–10 scale in terms of difficulty. Promising to be “every bit as muddy,” the 2010 Jeep Rocks and Road tour hit 11 different venues across the country to allow existing and prospective Jeep owners to put the 2011 vehicle lineup through their paces on and off road.

### Summary  
In short, brand resonance and the relationships consumers have with brands have two dimensions: *intensity* and *activity*. Intensity measures the strength of the attitudinal attachment and sense of community. Activity tells us how frequently the consumer buys and uses the brand, as well as engages in other activities not related to purchase and consumption.

### Brand-Building Implications  
The brand resonance model provides a road map and guidance for brand building, a yardstick by which brands can assess their progress in their brand-building efforts as well as a guide for marketing research initiatives. With respect to the latter, one model application aids in brand tracking and providing quantitative measures of the success of brand-building efforts (see Chapter 8). Figure 3-4 contains a set of candidate measures for the six brand building blocks.

The brand resonance model also reinforces a number of important branding tenets, five of which are particularly noteworthy. We discuss them in the following sections.
