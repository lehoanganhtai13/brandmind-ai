This data presents a comparative ranking of the top 25 global brands in 2011, detailing their brand value in both 2011 and 2010, the percentage change between these years, and their country of ownership. The structure is hierarchical, ordered by 2011 rank, with Coca-Cola at the top, followed by IBM and Microsoft. Brand values are presented in millions of US dollars, with significant year-over-year growth observed for brands like Apple (58% increase) and Google (27% increase), while others like Nokia experienced a decline (-15%). The majority of the top brands are owned by United States companies, though Japan, Germany, South Korea, France, and Sweden are also represented.
