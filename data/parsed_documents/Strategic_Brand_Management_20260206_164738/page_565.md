transformed its brand from essentially “crayons only” to all kinds of “colorful arts and crafts for kids,” a whole new product world opened up. Markers, clay, paint, chalk, and many other new products all helped the brand deliver its promise and achieve its potential in a meaningful way.

**Brand Extensions.**  
The vast majority of new products are extensions, and the vast majority of new products fail. In other words, too many brand extensions fail. Why? They are not creating sufficient relevance and differentiation in their new product or service categories. An increasingly competitive marketplace will be even more unforgiving to poorly positioned and marketed extensions in the years to come. To succeed, marketers must be rigorous and disciplined in analyzing and developing brand extensions.

We’ve looked at some of the academic research on brand extensions. Based on this and other inputs, Brand Focus 12.0 presented a scorecard with criteria for evaluating a proposed brand extension. The specifications there are intended to offer a starting point; particular items or the weights applied to them can be adjusted to the specific marketing context. The key point is that, by adopting some type of formal model or scorecard, we can apply systematic thinking to judging the merits of a proposed extension and increase its likelihood of success.

**Brand Elements.**  
The third aspect in a brand architecture strategy encompasses the name, look, and other branding elements applied to new products. A key concept here is the proper use of sub-branding. By combining new brand elements with existing parent brand elements, we can use sub-branding effectively to signal the intended similarity or fit of a new extension with its parent brand. Consumers are very literal. For example, putting the parent brand name before a new, individual name makes it more like the parent brand than putting it second. Marriott’s Courtyard is seen as much more of a Marriott hotel than Courtyard by Marriott by virtue of having the corporate name first.

A good sub-branding strategy can facilitate access to associations and attitudes to the company or family brand as a whole, while allowing for the creation of new brand beliefs to position the extension in the new category. Moreover, sub-branding can also help protect or shield the parent brand from any negative feedback that might be associated with an extension. In a carefully researched study, the sudden acceleration problems experienced by the Audi 5000 a number of years ago were found to significantly hurt the sales of its sibling Audi 4000, but they had a much less pronounced effect on sales of the Audi Quattro in part because of its more distinctive sub-branding.

To realize the benefits of association, however, sub-branding typically requires significant investments and disciplined and consistent marketing to establish the proper brand meanings with consumers. Without such financial commitments, marketers may be well advised to adopt the simplest brand hierarchy possible, such as using the company or family brand name with product descriptors.<sup>8</sup> Increased media coverage of business has brought greater transparency and awareness of companies’ internal and external actions and statements.
