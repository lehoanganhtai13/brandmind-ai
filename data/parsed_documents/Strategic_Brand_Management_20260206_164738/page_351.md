This table presents a typology of relationship forms, categorized by their underlying dynamics and exemplified through consumer brand associations. The relationships range from nonvoluntary unions like arranged marriage, kinship, and enslavement, to voluntarily formed bonds such as committed partnership, best friendship, and casual friendship. Other categories include marriages of convenience, rebound relationships, childhood friendships, and courtship, each defined by specific precipitating factors or transitional states. The table also details more intense or specialized relationships like dependency, enmity, and secret affairs, alongside short-term engagements like flings. Each relationship form is illustrated with case examples where individuals' brand preferences or usage are linked to the nature of their interpersonal connections, highlighting how relationship dynamics can manifest in consumer behavior.

> Fournier argues that these facets and their subfacets (such as trust within the partner quality facet or consumer-to-firm and firm-to-consumer intimacy) have superior diagnostic value over competing strength measures, and she suggests they have greater managerial utility in their application. In her experience, BRQ measures have been successfully incorporated in brand tracking studies, where they provide profiles of brand strength versus competitors, useful ties to marketplace performance indicators, and specific guidance for the enhancement and dilution of brand equity through managerial actions in the marketplace.
