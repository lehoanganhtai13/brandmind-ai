# BRANDING BRIEF 9-2

## Once Upon a Time . . . You Were What You Cooked

One of the most famous applications of psychographic techniques was made by Mason Haire in the 1940s. The purpose of the experiment was to uncover consumers’ true beliefs and feelings toward Nescafé instant coffee.

The impetus for the experiment was a survey conducted to determine why the initial sales of Nescafé instant coffee were so disappointing. The majority of the people who reported they didn’t like the product stated that the reason was the flavor. On the basis of consumer taste tests, however, Nescafé’s management knew consumers found the taste of instant coffee acceptable when they didn’t know what type of coffee they were drinking. Suspecting that consumers were not expressing their true feelings, Haire designed a clever experiment to discover what was really going on.

Haire set up two shopping lists containing the same six items. Shopping List 1 specified Maxwell House drip ground coffee, whereas Shopping List 2 specified Nescafé instant coffee, as follows:

This data presents a comparative analysis of two distinct shopping lists, highlighting their similarities and differences. Both lists share a substantial number of identical items, including a pound and a half of hamburger, two loaves of Wonder bread, a bunch of carrots, one can of Rumford’s Baking Powder, two cans of Del Monte peaches, and five pounds of potatoes. The sole divergence between Shopping List 1 and Shopping List 2 lies in the type of coffee specified: Shopping List 1 calls for Maxwell House coffee (drip ground), while Shopping List 2 opts for Nescafé instant coffee. This structure effectively isolates a single point of variation within an otherwise consistent set of grocery requirements.

Two groups of matched subjects were each given one of the lists and asked to “Read the shopping list. . . . Try to project yourself into the situation as far as possible until you can more or less characterize the woman who bought the groceries.” Subjects then wrote a brief description of the personality and character of that person.

After coding the responses into frequently mentioned categories, Haire found that two starkly different profiles emerged:

This data presents a comparative analysis of two coffee brands, Maxwell House and Nescafé, based on four distinct consumer perceptions. Maxwell House is perceived as "Lazy" by 4% of consumers and as "Fails to plan household purchases and schedules well" by 12%. Conversely, Nescafé is perceived as "Lazy" by a significantly higher 48% and also as "Fails to plan household purchases and schedules well" by 48%. In terms of positive attributes, Maxwell House is seen as "Thrifty" by 16% of consumers, whereas Nescafé is perceived as "Thrifty" by only 4%. A negative perception of "Not a good wife" is attributed to 16% of Nescafé consumers, while 0% of Maxwell House consumers hold this view. The structure is comparative, highlighting differing consumer perceptions across the two brands for each listed characteristic.

Haire interpreted these results as indicating that instant coffee represented a departure from homemade coffee and traditions with respect to caring for one’s family. In other words, at that time, the “labor-saving” aspect of instant coffee, rather than being an asset, was a liability in that it violated consumer traditions. Consumers were evidently reluctant to admit this fact when asked directly but were better able to express their true feelings when asked to project to another person.

The strategic implications of this new research finding were clear. Based on the original survey results, the obvious positioning for instant coffee with respect to regular coffee would have been to establish a point-of-difference on “convenience” and a point-of-parity on the basis of “taste.” Based on the projective test findings, however, it was obvious that there also needed to be a point-of-parity on the basis of user imagery. As a result, a successful ad campaign was launched that promoted Nescafé coffee as a way for housewives to free up time so they could devote additional time to more important household activities.
