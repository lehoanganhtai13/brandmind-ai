It is rare that a product will roll out in new markets the same way it did in the home market. Often, product introductions in the domestic market are sequential, stretched out over a longer period of time than the nearly simultaneous introductions that occur overseas.

### NIVEA
Nivea’s flagship product in its European home market has been its category leader, Nivea Creme. Although the company had introduced other skin care and personal care products, Nivea Creme had the most history and heritage and reflected many core brand values. In Asia, however, for cultural and climate reasons, the creme product was less well received, and the facial skin care sub-brand, Nivea Visage, and creme line extension, Nivea Soft, were of greater strategic and marketing importance. Because these two product brands have slightly different images than the Creme brand, an important issue was the impact on consumers’ collective impressions of Nivea. A strong initial emphasis on Nivea for Men in North America raised similar questions.

Different orders of introduction can profoundly affect consumer perceptions about what products the brand offers, the benefits supplied, and the needs satisfied. Thus, we need to examine the breadth and depth of recall to ensure that the proper brand salience and meaning exist.

**Crafting Brand Image.**  
If the product does not vary appreciably across markets, basic brand performance associations may not need to be that different. Brand imagery associations, on the other hand, may be quite different, and one challenge in global marketing is to meaningfully refine the brand image across diverse markets. History and heritage, which may be rich and a strong competitive advantage in the home market, may be virtually nonexistent in a new market. A desirable brand personality in one market may be less desirable in another. Nike’s competitive, aggressive user imagery proved a detriment in its introduction into European markets in the early 1990s. The company achieved greater success when it dialed down its image somewhat and emphasized team concepts more.

**Eliciting Brand Responses.**  
Brand judgments must be positive in new markets—consumers must find the brand to be of good quality, credible, worthy of consideration, and superior. Crafting the right brand image will help accomplish these outcomes. One of the challenges in global marketing, however, is creating the proper balance and type of emotional responses and brand feelings. Blending inner (enduring and private) and outer (immediate experiential) emotions can be difficult, given cultural differences across markets.

**Cultivating Resonance.**  
Finally, achieving brand resonance in new markets means that consumers must have sufficient opportunities and incentives to buy and use the product, interact with other consumers and the company itself, and actively learn and experience the brand and its marketing. Clearly, interactive, online marketing can be advantageous here, as long as it can be accessible and relevant anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, digital efforts cannot completely replace grassroots marketing efforts that help connect the consumer with the brand. Simply exporting marketing programs, even with some adjustments, may be insufficient because consumers may be too much at “arm’s length.” As a result, they may not be able to develop the intense, active loyalty that characterizes brand resonance.

### Global Brand Positioning
To best capture differences in consumer behavior, and to guide our efforts in revising the marketing program, we must revisit the brand positioning in each market. Recall that brand positioning means creating mental maps, defining core brand associations, identifying points-of-parity and points-of-difference, and crafting a band mantra. In developing a global brand positioning, we need to answer three key sets of questions:

1. How valid is the mental map in the new market? How appropriate is the positioning? What is the existing level of awareness? How valuable are the core brand associations, points-of-parity, and points-of-difference?
