## Evaluating Communication Options.

We can judge marketing communication options or communication types according to the response and communication effects they can create, as well as how they rate on the IMC choice criteria. Different communication types and options have different strengths and weaknesses and raise different issues.

Several points about the IMC choice criteria are worth noting. First, there are not necessarily any inherent differences across communication types for contribution and complementarity, because each communication type, if properly designed, can play a critical and unique role in achieving those communication objectives. Similarly, all marketing communications appear expensive, although some differences in cost per thousands can prevail. Communication types vary, however, in their breadth and depth of audience coverage, and in terms of commonality and conformability according to the number of modalities they employ: The more modalities available with a communication type, the greater its potential commonality and conformability.

Arriving at a final mix requires making decisions on priorities and tradeoffs among the IMC choice criteria, discussed next.

## Establishing Priorities and Trade-Offs.

The IMC program a marketer adopts, after profiling the various options, will depend in part on how he or she ranks the choice criteria. Because the IMC choice criteria themselves are related, the marketer must also make tradeoffs. The objectives of the marketing communication program, and whether they are short run or long run, will set priorities along with a host of factors beyond the scope of this chapter. We identify three possible tradeoffs with the IMC choice criteria that result from overlaps in coverage.

* *Commonality and complementarity will often be inversely related.* The more various marketing communication options emphasize the same brand attribute or benefit, all else being equal, the less they can effectively emphasize other attributes and benefits.
* *Conformability and complementarity will also often be inversely related.* The more a communication program accounts for differences in consumers across communication options, the less necessary it is that any one communication be designed to appeal to many different groups.
* *Commonality and conformability do not share an obvious relationship.* It may be possible, for example, to develop a sufficiently abstract message, like “Brand X is contemporary,” to effectively reinforce the brand across multiple communication types including advertising, interactive, sponsorship, and promotions.

# REVIEW

This chapter provided conceptual frameworks and managerial guidelines for how marketing communications can be integrated to enhance brand equity. The chapter addressed this issue from the perspective of customer-based brand equity, which maintains that brand equity is fundamentally determined by the brand knowledge created in consumers’ minds by the supporting marketing program. Four main types of communications were identified as being critical: (1) advertising and promotion, (2) interactive marketing, (3) events and experiences, and (4) mobile marketing.

A number of specific communication options—broadcast, print, direct response, and place advertising media; consumer and trade promotions; Web sites, online ads and videos, and social media online marketing; and events and experiences—were reviewed in terms of basic characteristics as well as success factors for effectiveness. Brand amplifiers that enhance these effects in the form of publicity and public relations, word-of-mouth, and buzz marketing were also discussed. The chapter also provided criteria as to how different communication options should be combined to maximally build brand equity.

Two key implications emerge from this discussion. First, from the perspective of customer-based brand equity, all possible communication options should be evaluated in terms of their ability to affect brand equity. In particular, the CBBE concept provides a common denominator by which the effects of different communication options can be evaluated: Each General Marketing Communication Guidelines: The “Keller Bs”
