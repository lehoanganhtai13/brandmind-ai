Branding Brief 15-1 provides more detail on these requirements for successful brand management in the form of the brand report card.¹

On the flip side of the coin, what common branding mistakes prevent firms from creating strong, powerful brands? The seven deadly sins of brand management include the following (see Figure 15-8):²

1. *Failure to fully understand the meaning of the brand:* Given that consumers “own” brands, it is critical to understand what they think and feel about them and then plan and implement marketing programs accordingly. Too often, managers convince themselves of the validity of marketing actions—for example, a new brand extension, ad campaign, or price hike—based on a mistaken belief about what consumers know or what marketers would like them to know about the brand. Managers often ignore the full range of associations—both tangible and intangible—that may characterize the brand.

2. *Failure to live up to the brand promise:* A brand should be a promise and a commitment to consumers, but too often that promise is broken. A common mistake is to set brand expectations too high and then fail to live up to them in the marketing program. By over-promising and not delivering, a firm is worse off in many ways than if it had not set expectations at all.

3. *Failure to adequately support the brand:* Creating and maintaining brand knowledge structures requires marketing investments. Too often, managers want to get something for nothing by building brand equity without providing proper marketing support or, once brand equity has been built, by expecting the brand to remain strong despite the lack of further investments.

4. *Failure to be patient with the brand:* Brand equity must be carefully and patiently built from the ground up. A firm foundation requires that consumers have the proper depth and breadth of awareness and strong, favorable, and unique associations in memory. Managers should avoid taking shortcuts that bypass more basic branding considerations—such as achieving the necessary level of brand awareness—to concentrate on flashier aspects of brand building related to its image.
