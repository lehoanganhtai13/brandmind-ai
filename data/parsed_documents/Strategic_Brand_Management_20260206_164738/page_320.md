This data presents a comparative analysis of the brand "Rolex," categorizing its attributes and associations. On one side, Rolex is characterized by exclusivity, high cost, precision, innovation, premium materials like gold and platinum, a distinctive crown logo, and exceptional customer service. These attributes are linked to a target demographic described as older, wealthy, high-class, and primarily masculine, with ambassadors in fields such as athletes, musicians, and artists. The brand is also associated with specific luxury sports like tennis, golf, sailing, racing, and equestrian activities, as well as with explorers. Conversely, the "Negative" category, highlighted with a distinct background, describes the brand as successful, luxurious, classic, prestigious, rugged, durable, and a status symbol. The table also notes negative perceptions, including being counterfeited and sold on the street, viewed as a frivolous purchase, and perceived as flashy and pretentious. The overall structure is comparative, contrasting positive brand attributes and associations with negative perceptions and associations.

# BRAND EXPLORATORY

## Consumer Knowledge

Rolex has successfully leveraged its history and tradition of excellence along with innovation to become the most powerful and recognized watchmaker in the world. Some positive consumer brand associations for Rolex might be “sophisticated,” “prestigious,” “exclusive,” “powerful,” “elegant,” “high quality.” Some negative brand associations that some consumers may link to the brand, however, could include “flashy” or “snobby.” Figure 8-9 displays a hypothetical Rolex mental map.

In one report by the Luxury Institute research group in New York, consumers had positive attitudes in terms of purchase intent toward Rolex. Wealthy people said they were more likely to buy a Rolex than any other brand for their next watch. The Rolex brand was far more recognizable (84 percent knew it) than Bulgari (39 percent) and even Cartier (63 percent), although several rivals outranked Rolex for perceived quality and exclusivity.<sup>40</sup>

A 2008 Mintel survey on the watch industry revealed that “women are still likely to view watches as an accessory, with many buyers choosing their watch based on looks alone. However, at the top end of the luxury market there is a growing number of women who are interested in mechanical watches. The study also found that women are increasingly choosing androgynous or unisex watches.”<sup>41</sup>

Many older, affluent people place a high value on owning a Rolex, whether new or collectible. In 2011, a Rolex sold for $1 million for the first time. The watch—an oversized stainless-steel split-second chronograph wristwatch manufactured in 1942—was purchased at Christie’s Geneva auction for $1,163,340, an all-time high price paid for any Rolex.<sup>42</sup>

While the brand and product line seem to resonate well with older, wealthy individuals, Rolex struggles somewhat to connect with younger consumers. In a NPD Group poll, 36 percent of people under the age of 25 didn’t wear a watch.<sup>43</sup> Another study by Piper Jaffray revealed that 59 percent of teenagers said they never wear a watch and 82 percent said they didn’t plan to buy one in the next six months.

## Brand Resonance Pyramid

The Rolex brand resonance model pyramid (see Chapter 3) is equally strong on the left-hand and right-hand sides. There is great synergy between the two sides of the pyramid; the functional and emotional benefits Rolex strives to deliver are in harmony with consumers’ imagery and feelings about the brand. The pyramid is also strong from bottom to top, enjoying the highest brand awareness of any luxury brand as well as high repeat purchase rates and high customer loyalty. Rolex has successfully focused on both the superior product attributes and the imagery associated with owning and wearing a Rolex. Figure 8-10 highlights some key aspects of the Rolex brand resonance pyramid.

## Competitive Analysis

Rolex has many competitors in the $26.5 billion watch industry; however, only a few brands compete in the very high-end market.<sup>44</sup> Through its pricing and distribution strategies, Rolex has positioned itself as a high-end luxury watch brand. On the lower end of the spectrum it competes with companies such as TAG Heuer and OMEGA, and on the high end with brands such as Patek Philippe, maker of the world’s most expensive wristwatch.

### TAG Heuer

A leader in the luxury watch industry, the Swiss firm TAG Heuer distinguishes itself by focusing on extreme chronograph precision in its watches, and on sports and auto-racing sponsorship in its advertising. Founded by Edouard Heuer in 1876, TAG Heuer has been a mainstay in the luxury watch business. In 1887, the firm created the first oscillating pinion, a technology that significantly improved the chronograph industry and is still used in many of its watches today. In 1895, it developed and patented the first water-resistant case for pocket watches. TAG Heuer expanded into the United States in 1910, introduced a chronograph wristwatch in 1914, and has continued to focus on chronograph innovation ever since.

TAG’s image and positioning is inextricably connected to chronograph precision. Its timepieces were the official stopwatches of the Olympic Games in 1920, 1924, and 1928. The firm was a Ferrari team sponsor of Formula 1 from 1971 to 1979 and was part of the TAG-McLaren racing team from 1985 to 2002. It was also the official timekeeper of the F-1 race series for much of the 1990s and early 2000s.<sup>45</sup> TAG Heuer has sponsored numerous Americas Cup teams and other yacht racing teams over the years.

TAG Heuer uses officially licensed retailers to sell its watches both in stores and online. These licensed retailers range from exclusive jewelers to department stores such as Nordstrom and Macy’s. The watchmaker generates brand awareness through Rolex Brand Resonance Pyramid
