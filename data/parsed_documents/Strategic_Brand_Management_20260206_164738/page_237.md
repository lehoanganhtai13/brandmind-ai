### Trade Promotions.  
Trade promotions are typically designed either to secure shelf space and distribution for a new brand, or to achieve more prominence on the shelf and in the store. Shelf and aisle positions in the store are important because they affect the ability of the brand to catch the eye of the consumer—placing a brand on a shelf at eye level may double sales over placing it on the bottom shelf.⁴⁵

Because of the large amount of money spent on trade promotions, there is increasing pressure to make trade promotion programs more effective. Many firms are failing to see the brand-building value in trade promotions and are seeking to reduce and eliminate as much of their expenditures as possible.

## Online Marketing Communications  
The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen a headlong rush by companies into the world of interactive, online marketing communications. With the pervasive incorporation of the Internet into everyday personal and professional lives, marketers are scrambling to find the right places to be in cyberspace. The main advantages to marketing on the Web are the low cost and the level of detail and degree of customization it offers. Online marketing communications can accomplish almost any marketing communication objective and are especially valuable in terms of solid relationship building.

Leading trade publication *Advertising Age*’s 2010 Media Vanguard Awards for innovative uses of technology in media planning showed the wide range of online applications that exist. Among the winners were Martha Stewart for her “multimedia vision,” *Financial Times* for successfully managing its free Web site alongside its paid online product, Kmart for showcasing a series of online videos to promote merchandising in its stores, and Allstate’s relaunch of its Teen Driver Web site to better “speak” in teen language and use interactive games and features to engage them.

Reviewing all the guidelines for online marketing communications is beyond the scope of this text.⁴⁶ Here, we’ll concentrate on three particularly crucial online brand-building tools:  
1. Web sites  
2. Online ads and videos  
3. Social media

### Web Sites.  
One of the earliest and best-established forms of online marketing communications for brands is company-created Web sites. By capitalizing on the Web’s interactive nature, marketers can construct Web sites that allow any type of consumer to choose the brand information relevant to his or her needs or desires. Even though different market segments may have different levels of knowledge and interest about a brand, a well-designed Web site can effectively communicate to consumers regardless of their personal brand or communications history.

Because consumers often go online to seek information rather than be entertained, some of the more successful Web sites are those that can convey expertise in a consumer-relevant area. For example, Web sites such as P&G’s www.pampers.com and General Mills’s www.cheerios.com offer baby care and parenting advice. Web sites can store company and product information, press releases, and advertising and promotional information as well as links to partners and key vendors. Web marketers can collect names and addresses for a database and conduct e-mail surveys and online focus groups.

Brand-building is increasingly a collaborative effort between consumers and brand marketers. As part of this process, there will be many consumer-generated Web sites and pages that may include ratings, reviews, and feedback on brands. Many consumers also post opinions and reviews or seek advice and feedback from others at commercial sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Epinions. As will be discussed in greater detail below, marketers must carefully monitor these different forums and participate where appropriate.

In creating online information sources for consumers at company Web sites, marketers must provide timely and reliable information. Web sites must be updated frequently and offer as much customized information as possible, especially for existing customers. Designing Web sites requires creating eye-catching pages that can sustain browsers’ interest, employing the latest technology and effectively communicating the brand message. Web site design is crucial, because if consumers do not have a positive experience, it may be very difficult to entice them back in the highly competitive and cluttered online world.

### Online Ads and Videos.  
Internet advertising comes in a variety of forms—banner ads, rich-media ads, and other types of ads. Advertising on the Internet has grown rapidly—in 2010 it totaled $26 billion in the United States, surpassing newspaper advertising ($22.8 billion) to rank second behind TV advertising ($28.6 billion).⁴⁷ A number of potential advantages exist for Internet advertising: It is accountable, because software can track which ads went to which sales; it is nondisruptive, so it doesn’t interrupt consumers; and it can target consumers so that only the most promising prospects are contacted, who can then seek as much or as little information as they desire.
