2. Decide how much of this equity enhancement, if any, is still needed.  
3. Retain the needed or desired equities still residing in the slogan as much as possible while providing whatever new twists of meaning are necessary to contribute to equity in other ways.

Sometimes modifying an existing slogan is more fruitful than introducing a new slogan with a completely new set of meanings. For example, Dockers switched its slogan from the well-received “Nice Pants” to “One Leg at a Time” in the late 1990s before reverting to the previous slogan when recognizing it had given up too much built-up equity.

### Jingles  
*Jingles* are musical messages written around the brand. Typically composed by professional songwriters, they often have enough catchy hooks and choruses to become almost permanently registered in the minds of listeners—sometimes whether they want them to or not! During the first half of the twentieth century, when broadcast advertising was confined primarily to radio, jingles were important branding devices.

We can think of jingles as extended musical slogans, and in that sense classify them as a brand element. Because of their musical nature, however, jingles are not nearly as transferable as other brand elements. They can communicate brand benefits, but they often convey product meaning in a nondirect and fairly abstract fashion. Thus the potential associations they might create for the brand are most likely to relate to feelings and personality and other intangibles.

Jingles are perhaps most valuable in enhancing brand awareness. Often, they repeat the brand name in clever and amusing ways that allow consumers multiple encoding opportunities. Consumers are also likely to mentally rehearse or repeat catchy jingles after the ad is over, providing even more encoding opportunities and increasing memorability.

A well-known jingle can serve as an advertising foundation for years. The familiar “Give Me a Break” jingle for Kit Kat candy bars has been sung in ads since 1988 and has helped make the brand the sixth best-selling chocolate candy bar in the United States.<sup>55</sup> There was an uproar when, after two decades, the U.S. Army switched from its familiar “Be All That You Can Be” to “Army of One.” Finally, the distinctive four-note signature to Intel’s ads echoes the company’s slogan “In-tel In-side.” Although the jingle seems simple, the first note alone is a mix of 16 sounds, including a tambourine and a hammer striking a brass pipe.<sup>56</sup>

### Packaging  
*Packaging* is the activities of designing and producing containers or wrappers for a product. Like other brand elements, packages have a long history. Early humans used leaves and animal skin to cover and carry food and water. Glass containers first appeared in Egypt as early as 2000 b.c. Later, the French emperor Napoleon awarded 12,000 francs to the winner of a contest to find a better way to preserve food, leading to the first crude method of vacuum packing.<sup>57</sup>

From the perspective of both the firm and consumers, packaging must achieve a number of objectives:<sup>58</sup>  
* Identify the brand.  
* Convey descriptive and persuasive information.  
* Facilitate product transportation and protection.  
* Assist in at-home storage.  
* Aid product consumption.

Marketers must choose the aesthetic and functional components of packaging correctly to achieve marketing objectives and meet consumers’ needs. Aesthetic considerations govern a package’s size and shape, material, color, text, and graphics. Innovations in printing processes now permit eye-catching and appealing graphics that convey elaborate and colorful messages on the package at the “moment of truth”—the point of purchase.<sup>59</sup>

Functionally, structural design is crucial. For example, innovations over the years have resulted in food packages that are resealable, tamperproof, and more convenient to use—easy to hold, easy to open, or squeezable. Consider these recent General Mills packaging innovations: Yoplait Go-Gurt’s yogurt in a tube packaging concept was a huge hit with kids and their parents; packaging for Betty Crocker Warm Delights showcased a microwavable (two minutes), convenient, single-serve dessert treat; and Green Giant Valley Fresh Steamers uses materials that withstand microwave cooking temperatures to offer steamable vegetables with sauce.<sup>60</sup> **Benefits.** Often, one of the strongest associations consumers have with a brand is inspired by the look of its packaging.
