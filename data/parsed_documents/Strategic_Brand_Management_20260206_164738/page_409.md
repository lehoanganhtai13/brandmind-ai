Adapting the brand, or some part of it, offers additional possibilities for making the connection.

* Hewlett-Packard capitalized on its highly successful LaserJet computer printers to introduce a number of new products using the “Jet” suffix, for example, the DeskJet, PaintJet, ThinkJet, and OfficeJet printers.
* McDonald’s has used its “Mc” prefix to introduce a number of products, such as Chicken McNuggets, Egg McMuffin, and the McRib sandwich.
* Donna Karan’s DKNY brand, Calvin Klein’s CK brand, and Ralph Lauren’s Double RL brand rely on initials.

We can also create a relationship between a brand and multiple products with common symbols. For example, corporate brands like Nabisco often place their corporate logo more prominently on their products than their name, creating a strong brand endorsement strategy.

Finally, it’s often a good idea to logically order brands in a product line, to communicate how they are related and to simplify consumer decision making. We can communicate the order though colors (American Express offers Red, Blue, Green, Gold, Platinum, and “Black” or Centurion cards), numbers (BMW offers its 3-, 5-, and 7-series cars), or other means. This strategy is especially important in developing brand migration pathways for customers to switch among the brands offered by the company. The relative position of a brand within a brand line may also affect consumer perceptions and preferences.[29]

# CORPORATE BRANDING

Given its fundamental importance in brand architecture, we will go into greater detail on corporate branding. A corporate brand is distinct from a product brand in that it can encompass a much wider range of associations. As detailed below, a corporate brand name may be more likely to evoke associations of common products and their shared attributes or benefits, people and relationships, programs and values, and corporate credibility.

These associations can have an important effect on the brand equity and market performance of individual products. For example, one research study revealed that consumers with a more favorable corporate image of DuPont were more likely to respond favorably to the claims made in an ad for Stainmaster carpet and therefore actually buy the product.[30]

Building and managing a strong corporate brand, however, can necessitate that the firm keep a high public profile, especially to influence and shape some of the more abstract types of associations. The CEO or managing director, if associated with a corporate brand, must also be willing to maintain a more public profile to help communicate news and information, as well as perhaps provide a symbol of current marketing activities. At the same time, a firm must also be willing to subject itself to more scrutiny and be extremely transparent in its values, activities, and programs. Corporate brands thus have to be comfortable with a high level of openness.

A corporate brand offers a host of potential marketing advantages, but only if corporate brand equity is carefully built and nurtured—a challenging task. Many marketing winners in the coming years will therefore be those firms that properly build and manage corporate brand equity. Branding Brief 11-3 describes a closely related concept—corporate reputation—and how we can look at it from the perspective of consumers and other firms.[31]

*Corporate brand equity* is the differential response by consumers, customers, employees, other firms, or any relevant constituency to the words, actions, communications, products, or services provided by an identified corporate brand entity. In other words, positive corporate brand equity occurs when a relevant constituency responds more favorably to a corporate ad campaign, a corporate-branded product or service, a corporate-issued PR release, and so on than if the same offering were attributed to an unknown or fictitious company.

A corporate brand can be a powerful means for firms to express themselves in a way that isn’t tied to their specific products or services. The Science of Branding 11-3 describes one approach to defining corporate brand personality.
