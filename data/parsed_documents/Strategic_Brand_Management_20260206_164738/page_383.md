In its current form, it contradicts IFRS 3 in that it states that brands developed by a company do not qualify to be described as assets. They fail to meet the recognition criteria. This is an anomaly that is known and understood by the accounting standard setters. Work had been invested in bringing IAS 38 into line but was delayed as the accounting boards dealt with the financial crisis of 2008 and other matters.61

**IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.** This standard was issued formally during the course of 2011. As its name implies, it explains in considerable detail how an asset should be measured at its fair value. While it doesn’t specify brands, it makes allowance for a class of assets that can be difficult to value because they lack publicly available data. This standard provides substantial guidance on how brands should be valued.

**IFRS 36 Impairment of Assets.** Accounting principles state that an asset should not be held on the balance sheet at its original value if that value no longer applies. IFRS 36 requires assets to be tested annually, and if the value has fallen below what is called the carrying amount, the difference must be treated as a loss in the income statement. That rarely applies to brands, which tend to increase in value over time, yet there is no allowance at this stage for the opposite of impairment, which is accretion. What makes the standard useful to brand owners is the clear explanation of how the annual measurement process should be conducted.

4. Peter Farquhar and Yuji Ijiri have made several other distinctions in classifying brand equity measurement procedures. Peter H. Farquhar, Julia W. Han, and Yuji Ijiri, “Recognizing and Measuring Brand Assets,” *Marketing Science Institute Report* (1991): 91–119. They describe two broad classes of measurement approaches to brand equity: separation approaches and integration approaches. Separation approaches view brand equity as the value added to a product. Farquhar and Ijiri categorize separation approaches into residual methods and comparative methods. Residual methods determine brand equity by what remains after subtracting physical product effects. Comparative methods determine brand equity by comparing the branded product with an unbranded product or an equivalent benchmark.

Integration approaches, on the other hand, typically define brand equity as a composition of basic elements. Farquhar and Ijiri categorize integration approaches into association and valuation methods. Valuation methods measure brand equity by its cost or value as an intangible asset for a particular owner and intended use. Association methods measure brand equity in terms of the favorableness of brand evaluations, the accessibility of brand attitudes, and the consistency of brand image with consumers.

The previous chapter described techniques that could be considered association methods. This chapter considers techniques related to the other three categories of methods.
