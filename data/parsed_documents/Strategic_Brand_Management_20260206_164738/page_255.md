## Empirical Generalizations in Advertising

In a comprehensive academic endeavor, a number of researchers have worked together to accumulate what they call “empirical generalizations” (EG) of advertising. In putting this research into context, the lead authors Jerry Wind and Byron Sharp note: 

> “Even advertising has scientific laws, empirical patterns that generalize across a wide range of known conditions. These empirical generalizations provide us with benchmarks, predictions, and valuable insights into how the digital revolution may affect advertising.”

Empirical generalizations emerge from careful, thoughtful research. The authors are quick to add several caveats. Empirical generalizations are not formal laws themselves and there may be important exceptions and boundary conditions as to when they operate. Nevertheless, they suggest three possible benefits to having some empirical generalizations: (1) as a starting point in the development of an advertising strategy; (2) as an initial set of tentative rules that management can follow; and (3) as a benchmark, giving management some sense of how much change to expect when advertising is launched or something changes in the advertising environment.

The empirical generalizations they identified can be grouped into four broad topics: ROI, 360-degree media planning, value of TV, and creative quality.

### ROI

* Advertising typically has a half-life of three to four weeks. If advertising is to be sales-effective in the long term, it must show immediate sales effects in single-source data.
* Based on the established EG that advertising elasticity is approximately 0.1, net profit is optimized by setting the advertising budget to be 10 percent of gross profit. If the elasticity is 0.15, then the advertising budget should be 15 percent of gross profit, and so on.
* Brand advertising often has a pronounced short-term sales impact (as shown in single-source data). This impact decays over time. The most dramatic influence on short-term effect is creative copy.
* Even with no clicks or minimal clicks, online display advertisements generate lift in site visitation, trademark search queries, and lift in both online and offline sales.
* In-store digital signage featuring “newsworthy” information (e.g., new items, seasonal offers, promotions) has a markedly favorable impact on sales. This effect is stronger for hedonic (food and entertainment) products.
* TV advertising for consumer services follow a 70:30 rule (70 percent of the efforts create interest, 30 percent create action). And 90 percent of TV advertising for consumer services dissipates within three months (versus four months for consumer goods).
* If advertising changes by 1 percent, sales or market share will change by about 0.1 percent. (That is, advertising elasticity is 0.1.) The advertising elasticity is higher in Europe relative to the United States, for durables relative to nondurables, in early relative to late stages of the product life cycle, and in print over TV.
* There is a greater than 50 percent chance that the typical TV advertising campaign will lose money both short term and long term. The risk of losing money fluctuates over the years, but has been over 50 percent. The average elasticity of TV advertising has fluctuated between 0.043 and 0.163 over the past 25 years.
* The advertising response curve is “convex”—the greatest marginal response is from the first exposures. As the number of cumulative exposures in a period increases, the marginal effect of the advertising drops.

### 360-Degree Media Planning

* A retail store layout that makes shopping quicker results in increased shopper spending.
* Approximately 20 percent of word-of-mouth (WOM) about brands refers to paid advertising in media. The level and effectiveness of WOM are substantially increased when stimulated, encouraged, and/or supported by advertising, increasing the probability by about 20 percent that a consumer will make a strong recommendation to buy or try a product.
* If the advertisements recently recalled were on traditional media, they were more likely to have left a positive impression than if they were on digital media. If the consumers had a previous positive impression of the brand or product advertised for advertisements recently recalled, the advertisements were more likely to have left a positive impression, regardless of the media.
* Doubling the clutter does not halve the number of advertisements recalled. Advertisements recalled in high clutter are more likable on average.
* Repeat viewing is 38 percent, and this does not alter when a program changes time. Repeat viewing is lower for comedies than police dramas and for low rating shows, but within these program types or ratings levels repeat viewing remains at a consistent low or high value across time changes.
* Where TV, radio, and magazines (and even special interest ones) claim to attract a specific audience, the target group is typically less than half of the media’s total audience, and rival outlets often outperform them in reaching this subsegment.
* Spaced multiple exposures (distributed) produce greater learning than repeated exposures with short intervals (massed). Longer intervals between exposures result in better learning than shorter intervals.

### Value of TV

* Over the past 15 years, TV has not declined in its effectiveness at generating sales lift, and appears to be more effective than either online or print at generating brand awareness and recognition.
