Regardless, copy-testing results should not be seen as a means of making a “go” or “no go” decision; ideally, they should play a diagnostic role in helping to understand *how* an ad works.  
As an example of the potential fallibility of pretesting, consider NBC’s experiences with the popular TV series *Seinfeld*.

## SEINFELD

In October 1989, *The Seinfeld Chronicles*, as it was called then, was shown to several groups of viewers in order to gauge the show’s potential, like most television pilot projects awaiting final network approval. The show tested badly—very badly. The summary research report noted that “no segment of the audience was eager to watch the show again.” The reaction to Seinfeld himself was “lukewarm” because his character was seen as “powerless, dense, and naïve.” The test report also concluded that “none of the supports were particularly liked and viewers felt that Jerry needed a better back-up ensemble.” Despite the weak reaction, NBC decided to go ahead with what became one of the most successful television shows of the 1990s. Although NBC also changed its testing methods, this experience reinforces the limitations of testing and the dangers of relying on single numbers.<sup>13</sup>

### Future Prospects.

In the new Internet era, the future of television and traditional mass marketing advertising is uncertain as top marketers weigh their new communication options. Some “New Year’s Resolutions” drafted for 2010 reveal their changing mind-set:<sup>14</sup>

* Richard Gerstein, senior VP of marketing at Sears: “Stay focused on creating personalized digital relationships with our customers by meeting their individual needs in an integrated way through our stores, Web sites, call center, and innovative mobile shopping sites.”
* Keith Levy, VP of marketing at Anheuser-Busch: “To find the next Facebook or Twitter phenomenon . . . making sure we’re in the places our consumers are increasingly headed and being there in an authentic way.”

Although digital has captured the imagination of marketers everywhere, at least for some, the power of TV ads remains. In a series of interviews in 2011, many CMOs also continued to show their support for TV advertising. Procter & Gamble CMO Marc Pritchard put it directly when he said, “TV will continue to be an essential part of our marketing mix to reach people with our brands.”<sup>15</sup> TV spending is forecast to continue to make up almost 40 percent of all U.S. ad spending through 2015.

### Radio.

Radio is a pervasive medium: 93 percent of all U.S. consumers 12 years and older listen to the radio daily and, on average, for over 15 hours a week, although often only in the background.<sup>16</sup> Perhaps the main advantage to radio is flexibility—stations are highly targeted, ads are relatively inexpensive to produce and place, and short closings allow for quick responses.

Radio is a particularly effective medium in the morning and can effectively complement or reinforce TV ads. Radio also enables companies to achieve a balance between broad and localized market coverage. Obvious disadvantages of radio, however, are the lack of visual image and the relatively passive nature of consumer processing that results. Several brands, however, have effectively built brand equity with radio ads.

## MOTEL 6

One notable radio ad campaign is for Motel 6, the nation’s largest budget motel chain, which was founded in 1962 when the “6” stood for $6 a night. After finding its business fortunes hitting bottom in 1986 with an occupancy rate of only 66.7 percent, Motel 6 made a number of marketing changes, including the launch of a radio campaign of humorous 60-second ads featuring folksy contractor-turned-writer Tom Bodett. Containing the clever tag line “We’ll Leave the Light on for You,” the campaign is credited with a rise in occupancy and a revitalization of the brand that continues to this day.<sup>17</sup> Next away game, think about Motel 6 for your team's stay.
