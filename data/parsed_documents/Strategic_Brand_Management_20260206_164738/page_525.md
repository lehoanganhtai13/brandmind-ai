# BRANDING BRIEF 14-3

## UPS’s European Express

After first entering the European market in 1976, United Parcel Service of America (UPS) spent $1 billion between 1987 and 1997 to buy 16 delivery businesses, put brown uniforms on 25,000 Europeans, and spray its brown paint on 10,000 delivery trucks in the process of becoming the largest delivery company in Europe. To achieve that goal, UPS had to overcome a number of obstacles along the way.

French drivers were outraged that they could not have wine with lunch; British drivers protested when their dogs were banned from delivery trucks; Spaniards were dismayed when they realized the brown UPS trucks resembled the local hearses; and Germans were shocked when brown shirts were required for the first time since 1945. UPS ultimately allowed a degree of local interpretation while standing firm on some issues of company policy, such as brown trucks and uniforms and alcohol-free drivers.

Although UPS operations were basically the same, the company faced problems that were less common or even nonexistent in the United States at that time: truck restrictions on weekends and holidays, low bridges and tunnels, widely varying weight regulations, terrible traffic, and, in some places, limited highway systems, primitive airports, and curfews. In addition, the standard of service in Europe in the 1990s was typically well below what U.S. consumers were accustomed to. Another issue was that express delivery was not yet as popular in Europe as it was in the States. As one industry analyst observed then, “Europeans are not as time-sensitive as the Americans are.”

The spread of services and service-related jobs in Europe over the prior two decades had been hampered by a reluctance there to part with traditional ways of doing business, such as state-owned monopolies and rigid work practices. Workers resisted part-time work and had stronger employment protection and higher nonwage costs than workers in the United States. As a result, Manpower Inc. virtually created the temporary-help business in Europe and was able to derive more than 40 percent of its worldwide revenues there.

To improve its share of European business, UPS spent an estimated $1.1 billion between 1995 and 2000 upgrading its European operations by purchasing vehicles, aircraft, buildings, and logistics systems. Consequently, export shipping in Europe via UPS rose at a compound annual rate of 22 percent between 1996 and 2002. Since then, UPS has continued to invest in its European business, acquiring package delivery companies Stolica and Lynx in Poland and the U.K., respectively, in 2005; building a modern new $135 million automated package sorting hub at Cologne/Bonn airport to double processing capacity; and introducing three daily time-definite delivery options to provide customers the greatest shipping flexibility.

The 2012 acquisition of Dutch-based TNT Express for almost $7 billion increased UPS’s European small-parcel revenue to $60 billion in annual sales and its market share to 20 percent. It also expanded the company’s aircraft and vehicle fleet infrastructure to help it move more deeply into the Asia-Pacific region and better compete with DHL and FedEx.

All these investments have paid off. Now the world’s largest package delivery company and a global leader in supply chain management, UPS serves 60 European countries and territories from its Cologne/Bonn, Germany hub, with a staff of 43,000 employees and a delivery fleet of 8,800 package cars, vans, tractors, and motorcycles. The company has experienced years of strong export volume growth in Europe.
