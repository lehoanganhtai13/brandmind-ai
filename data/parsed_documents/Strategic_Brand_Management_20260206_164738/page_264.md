Marketers can choose entities for which consumers have some or even a great deal of similar associations. A *commonality* leveraging strategy makes sense when consumers have associations to another entity that are congruent with desired brand associations. For example, consider a country such as New Zealand, which is known for having more sheep than people. A New Zealand sweater manufacturer that positioned its product on the basis of its “New Zealand wool” presumably could more easily establish strong and favorable brand associations because New Zealand may already mean “wool” to many people.

On the other hand, there may be times when entities are chosen that represent a departure for the brand because there are few if any common or similar associations. Such *complementarity* branding strategies can be strategically critical in terms of delivering the desired position. The marketer’s challenge here is to ensure that the less congruent knowledge for the entity has either a direct or an indirect effect on existing brand knowledge. This may require skillfully designed marketing programs that overcome initial consumer confusion or skepticism. For example, when Buick signed Tiger Woods as an endorser, many questioned whether consumers would find a fit or consistency between the golfer and the car maker, and, if not, how much value the endorsement would add to the Buick brand.

Even if consumers buy into the association one way or another, leveraging secondary brand associations may be risky because the marketer gives up some control of the brand image. The source factors or related person, place, or thing will undoubtedly have a host of other associations, of which only some smaller set will be of interest to the marketer. Managing the transfer process so that only the relevant secondary knowledge becomes linked to the brand may be difficult. Moreover, this knowledge may change over time as consumers learn more about the entity, and these new associations, judgments, or feelings may or may not be advantageous for the brand.

The following sections consider some of the main ways by which we can link secondary brand associations to the brand.

## COMPANY

Branding strategies are an important determinant of the strength of association from the brand to the company and any other existing brands. Three main branding options exist for a new product:

1. Create a new brand.  
2. Adopt or modify an existing brand.  
3. Combine an existing and a new brand.

Existing brands may be related to the corporate brand, say Samsung, or a specific product brand like Samsung Galaxy S 4G mobile phone. If the brand is linked to an existing brand, as with options 2 and 3, then knowledge about the existing brand may also become linked to the brand.

In particular, a corporate or family brand can be a source of much brand equity. For example, a corporate brand may evoke associations of common product attributes, benefits, or attitudes; people and relationships; programs and values; and corporate credibility. Branding Brief 7-1 describes the corporate image campaign for IBM.

Leveraging a corporate brand may not always be useful, however. In fact, in some cases, large companies have deliberately introduced new brands or bought successful niche brands in an attempt to convey a “smaller” image. Examples of the latter strategy—that might even surprise their existing customers!—include Ben and Jerry’s (Unilever), Kashi (Kellogg’s), Odwalla (Coca-Cola), and Tom’s of Maine (Colgate-Palmolive). Clorox paid almost $1 billion for Burt’s Bees—famous for beeswax lip balm, lotions, soaps and shampoos—in part because of the market opportunity, but also to better learn about best practices for environmental sustainability, an emerging corporate priority.<sup>3</sup> Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH) acquired a stake in the dynamic Asian label Charles & Keith to gain exposure to fast fashion in China.
