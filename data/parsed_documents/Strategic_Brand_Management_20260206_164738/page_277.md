# BRANDING BRIEF 7-3

## Ingredient Branding the DuPont Way

Perhaps one of the most successful ingredient brand marketers of all times is DuPont, which was founded in Delaware as a black-powder manufacturer in 1802 by Frenchman E. I. duPont de Nemours. Over the years, the company introduced a number of innovative products for use in markets ranging from apparel to aerospace. Many of the company’s innovations, such as Lycra and Stainmaster fabrics, Teflon coating, and Kevlar fiber, became household names as ingredient brands in consumer products manufactured by many other companies. Although some have been spun off, the company still maintains a healthy roster of consumer products.

Early on, DuPont learned an important branding lesson the hard way. Because the company did not protect the name of its first organic chemical fiber, nylon, it was not trademarkable and became generic. The brands created by DuPont through the years have been components in a wide variety of products that are marketed to make everyday life better, safer, and healthier.

In 2010, DuPont recorded more than $9.5 billion in revenue from new products and applications launched between 2007 and 2010, representing 31 percent of total revenue. These innovations have been the result of the company’s massive R&D program ($1.7 billion spent in 2010). DuPont has over 75 R&D facilities globally, including 35 outside the United States. The highest proportion of the R&D budget—approximately 50 percent—is dedicated to agriculture and nutrition, which is currently its fastest-growing business segment.

A key question that DuPont constantly confronts is whether to brand a product as an ingredient brand. To address this question, the firm has traditionally applied several criteria, both quantitative and qualitative.

* On the *quantitative* side, DuPont has a model that estimates the return on investment of promoting a product as an ingredient brand. Inputs to the model include brand resource allocations such as advertising and trade support; outputs relate to favorability ratings and potential sales. The goal of the model is to determine whether branding an ingredient can be financially justified, especially in industrial markets.
* On the *qualitative* side, DuPont assesses how an ingredient brand can help a product’s positioning. If competitive and consumer analyses reveal that conveying certain associations would boost sales, DuPont is more likely to brand the ingredient. For example, one reason that DuPont launched its stain-resistant carpet fiber under the ingredient brand Stainmaster was that the company felt a “tough” association would be highly valued in the market.

DuPont maintains that an appropriate, effective ingredient branding strategy leads to a number of competitive advantages, such as higher price premiums (often as much as 20 percent), enhanced brand loyalty, and increased bargaining power with other members of the value chain. DuPont employs both push and pull strategies to create its ingredient brands. Consumer advertising creates consumer pull by generating interest in the brand and a willingness to specifically request it. Extensive trade support in the form of co-op advertising, training, and trade promotions creates push by fostering a strong sense of loyalty to DuPont from other members of the value chain. This loyalty helps DuPont negotiate favorable terms from distributors and leads to increased cooperation when new products are introduced.
