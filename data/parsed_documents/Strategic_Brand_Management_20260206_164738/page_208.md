establishing its own distribution channel. Nevertheless, many retailers and manufacturers are dancing around the turf issue, avoiding head-on clashes in establishing competitive distribution channels. Manufacturers in particular have been careful to stress that their stores are not a competitive threat to their retailers but rather a “showcase” that can help sell merchandise for any retailer carrying their brand. Branding Brief 5-2 describes some of Goodyear’s channel conflict experiences.

### Store-Within-a-Store.

Besides creating their own stores, some marketers—such as Nike, Polo, and Levi Strauss (with Dockers)—are attempting to create their own shops within major department stores. More common in other parts of the world such as Asia, these approaches can offer the dual benefits of appeasing retailers—and perhaps even allowing them to benefit from the retailer’s brand image—while at the same time allowing the firm to retain control over the design and implementation of the product presentation at the point of purchase.⁸⁷

The store-within-a-store concept can take hold through actual leasing arrangements or less formal arrangements where branded mini-stores are used. For retailers, these arrangements help drive foot traffic and acquire new capabilities quickly. For smaller brands, like Murray’s Cheese Shop, which has an arrangement with Kroger, they allow for quick distribution growth.

Retailers are also combining with other retailers to seek similar benefits.⁸⁸ Sears has partnered with much trendier retailer Forever 21 to upgrade its image as well as established in-store leases with Edwin Watts Golf Shops, uniform apparel seller Work N’ Gear, and Whole Foods organic foods grocer. Macy’s has partnered with Sunglass Hut, maternity apparel brand Destination Modernity, and UK toiletries brand Lush.

The goal in all these situations is to find “win–win” solutions that benefit channel partners and consumers alike. In explaining the rationale of hosting beauty-products retailer Sephora in its stores, one JCPenny’s executive noted, “Longtime Sephora fanatics come in and wind up becoming loyal JCPenney shoppers, and vice versa.”⁸⁹

### Other Means.

Finally, another channel option is to sell directly to consumers via phone, mail, or electronic means. Retailers have sold their goods through catalogs for years. Many mass marketers, especially those that also sell through their own retail stores, are increasingly using direct selling, a long-successful strategy for brands such as Mary Kay and Avon. These vehicles not only help sell products but also contribute to brand equity by increasing consumer awareness of the range of products associated with a brand and increasing consumer understanding of the key benefits of those products. Marketers can execute direct marketing efforts in many ways, such as catalogs, videos, or physical sites, all of which are opportunities to engage in a dialogue and establish a relationship with consumers.
