### The Big Five.

We can assess brand personality more definitively through adjective checklists or ratings. Jennifer Aaker conducted a research project that provides an interesting glimpse into the personality of a number of well-known brands, as well as a methodology to examine the personality of any one brand. Based on an extensive data collection of ratings of 114 personality traits on 37 brands in various product categories by over 600 individuals representative of the U.S. population, she created a brand personality scale that reflected the following five factors (with underlying facets) of brand personality:^[22]

1. Sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful)  
2. Excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up-to-date)  
3. Competence (reliable, intelligent, and successful)  
4. Sophistication (upper class and charming)  
5. Ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough)  

Figure 9-4 depicts the specific trait items that make up the Aaker brand personality scale. Respondents in her study rated how descriptive each personality trait was for each brand according to a seven-point scale (1 = not at all descriptive; 7 = extremely descriptive). Aaker averaged responses to provide summary measures. Some brands tend to be strong on one particular factor; some brands like Nike are high on more than one factor; some brands score poorly on all factors.

A cross-cultural study exploring the generalizability of this scale outside the United States found that three of the five factors applied in Japan and Spain, but that a “peacefulness” dimension replaced “ruggedness” both in Japan and Spain, and a “passion” dimension emerged in Spain instead of “competency.”^[23] Research on brand personality in Korea revealed that two culture-specific factors emerge (“passive likeableness” and “ascendancy”), reflecting the importance of Confucian values in Korea’s social and economic systems.^[24]

### Ethnographic and Experiential Methods

More than ever, researchers are working to improve the effectiveness of their qualitative approaches, as well as to go beyond traditional qualitative techniques to research consumers in their natural environment.^[25] The rationale is that no matter how clever the research design, consumers may not be able to fully express their true selves as part of a formalized research study. By tapping more directly into consumers’ actual home, work, or shopping behaviors, researchers might be able to elicit more meaningful responses.^[26] As markets become more competitive **FIGURE 9-4**
