abroad. General Motors’s success in Brazil in the 1990s after years of mediocre performance came about in part because of its concerted efforts to develop a lean manufacturing program and a sound dealership strategy to create the proper marketing infrastructure.⁵⁷

### 4. Embrace Integrated Marketing Communications

A number of top global firms have introduced extensive integrated marketing communications programs. Overseas markets don’t have the same advertising opportunities as the expansive, well-developed U.S. media market. As a result, U.S.-based marketers have had to embrace other forms of communication in those markets—such as sponsorship, promotions, public relations, merchandising activity, and so on—to a much greater extent.

To help make the quintessentially Vermont brand Ben & Jerry’s more locally relevant in Britain, the company ran a contest to create the “quintessential British ice cream flavor.” Finalists covered the gamut of the British cultural spectrum and included references to royalty (Cream Victoria and Queen Yum Mum), rock and roll (John Lemon and Ruby Chewsday), literature (Grape Expectations and Agatha Crispie), and Scottish heritage (Nessie’s Nectar and Choc Ness Monster). Other finalists included Minty Python, Cashew Grant, and James Bomb. The winning flavor, *Cool Britannia*, was a play on the popular British military anthem *Rule Britannia* and consisted of vanilla ice cream, English strawberries, and chocolate-covered Scottish shortbread.⁵⁸

Consider how DHL employed a wide range of communication options to strengthen its global brand.

#### DHL

DHL, part of Deutsche Post DHL, has positioned itself as “The Logistics Company for the World.” The pillars of this brand positioning are unrivaled speed, efficiency, and strong customer service. The “International Specialists” campaign emphasizes the company’s expertise in local delivery, customs clearance, express shipping, and customer care. The U.S. campaign included a mix of digital, elevator video, airport, and print advertising across the nation and ran in prominent daily newspapers and business magazines. The campaign is also running in global media across 42 key markets, translated into 25 local languages on 280 TV stations. The TV ads featured the classic anthem, *Ain’t No Mountain High Enough*, sung by rising British star Dionne Bromfield. A social media digital component invited users to upload their own version of the song in a YouTube contest. The campaign was not entirely externally focused. An internal brand engagement initiative required all DHL employees to complete a course that would help their customers grow their business. During the campaign launch, DHL was also the Official Logistics Partner for Rugby World Cup 2011.⁵⁹

### 5. Cultivate Brand Partnerships

Most global brands have marketing partners of some form in their international markets, ranging from joint venture partners, licensees or franchisees, and distributors, to ad agencies and other marketing support people. One common reason for establishing brand partnerships is to gain access to distribution. For example, Guinness has very strategically used partnerships to develop markets or provide expertise it lacked. Joint venture partners, such as with Moet Hennessey, have provided access to distribution abroad that otherwise would have been hard to achieve within the same time constraints. These partnerships were crucial for Guinness as it expanded operations into the developing markets that provide almost half its profits. Similarly, Lipton increased its sales by 500 percent in the first four years of partnering with PepsiCo to distribute its product. Lipton added the power of its brand to the ready-to-drink iced tea market, while PepsiCo added its contacts in global distribution.

Barwise and Robertson identify three alternative ways to enter a new global market:⁶⁰

1. By exporting existing brands of the firm into the new market (introducing a “geographic extension”)
2. By acquiring existing brands already sold in the new market but not owned by the firm
3. By creating some form of brand alliance with another firm (joint ventures, partnerships, or licensing agreements) They also identify three key criteria—speed, control, and investment—by which to judge the different entry strategies.
