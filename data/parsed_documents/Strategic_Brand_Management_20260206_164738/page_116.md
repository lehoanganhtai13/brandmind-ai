Associations to a typical usage situation can relate to the time of day, week, month, or year to use the brand; location—for instance, inside or outside the home; and type of activity during which to use the brand—formal or informal. For a long time, pizza chain restaurants had strong associations to their channels of distribution and the manner by which customers would purchase and eat the pizza—  
Domino’s was known for delivery, Little Caesar for takeout, and Pizza Hut for dine-in service—although in recent years each of these major competitors has made inroads in the traditional markets of the others.

### Brand Personality and Values.

Through consumer experience or marketing activities, brands may take on personality traits or human values and, like a person, appear to be “modern,” “old-fashioned,” “lively,” or “exotic.”<sup>9</sup> Five dimensions of brand personality (with corresponding subdimensions) are sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up-to-date), competence (reliable, intelligent, successful), sophistication (upper class and charming), and ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough).<sup>10</sup>

How does brand personality get formed? Any aspect of a brand may be used by consumers to infer brand personality. One research study found that consumers perceived nonprofit companies as being “warmer” than for-profit companies but as less competent. Further, consumers were less willing to buy a product made by a nonprofit than a for-profit company because of their perception that the firm lacked competence, but those purchasing misgivings disappeared when perceptions of the competency of the nonprofit were improved, for example, by a credible endorsement such as from the *Wall Street Journal*.<sup>11</sup>

Although any aspect of the marketing program may affect brand personality, marketing communications and advertising may be especially influential because of the inferences consumers make about the underlying user or usage situation depicted or reflected in an ad. For example, advertisers may imbue a brand with personality traits through anthropomorphization and product animation techniques; through personification and the use of brand characters; and through user imagery, such as the preppy look of Abercrombie & Fitch models.<sup>12</sup> More generally, the actors in an ad, the tone or style of the creative strategy, and the emotions or feelings evoked by the ad can affect brand personality. Once brands develop a personality, it can be difficult for consumers to accept information they see as inconsistent with that personality.<sup>13</sup>

Still, user imagery and brand personality may not always be in agreement. When performance-related attributes are central to consumer decisions, as they are for food products, for example, brand personality and user imagery may be less closely related. Differences between personality and imagery may arise for other reasons too. For example, early in its U.S. brand development, Perrier’s brand personality was “sophisticated” and “stylish,” whereas its actual user imagery was not as flattering or subdued but “flashy” and “trendy.”

When user and usage imagery are important to consumer decisions, however, brand personality and imagery are more likely to be related, as they are for cars, beer, liquor, cigarettes, and cosmetics. Thus, consumers often choose and use brands that have a brand personality consistent with their own self-concept, although in some cases the match may be based on consumers’ desired rather than their actual image.<sup>14</sup> These effects may also be more pronounced for publicly consumed products than for privately consumed goods because the signaling aspect of a brand may be more important under those conditions.<sup>15</sup> Consumers who are high “self-monitors” and sensitive to how others see them are more likely to choose brands whose personalities fit the consumption situation.<sup>16</sup>

User and usage imagery is often an issue in the highly competitive automotive category. One company looking to sharpen its brand personality and imagery is Chrysler.

### CHRYSLER

After a disastrous corporate marriage to Germany’s Daimler had been dissolved, Chrysler’s new partner Fiat set out to revitalize the brand, in part by injecting some Italian style and sex appeal. Determined to attract younger, hipper, and wealthier customers, Fiat developed new car designs similar to the quirky little cars most likely found in Rome. Fiat is not planning to walk away, however, from some of the equity in its existing brands such as the Dodge Ram pickup truck and Town & Country minivan. For the relatively new Chrysler 300, a $1 billion model makeover retained the powerful German-engineered transmission but added an elegant look and attitude. A two-minute, $9 million TV ad run during the Super Bowl used controversial rapper Eminem to boldly proclaim that the car was “Imported from Detroit.”<sup>17</sup>
