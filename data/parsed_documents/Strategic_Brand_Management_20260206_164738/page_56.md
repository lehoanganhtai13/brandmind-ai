# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 1-4

## Marketing Brands in a Recession

Tough times present opportunities as well as challenges, as was the case with the most recent recession. Although many marketers face reduced funding and intense pressure to justify marketing programs as cost-effective, there are tactics that can help marketers survive—or even thrive—in a recession, both in the short run *and* over the long haul. Here are five guidelines to improve the odds for success during this time.

### Explore the Upside of Actually Increasing Investment

Does it pay to invest during a recession? Forty years of evidence from past recessions suggest that firms willing to capitalize on a marketing opportunity by investing during a recession have, on average, improved their fortunes compared with firms that chose to cut back.

### Now, More Than Ever, Get Closer to Your Consumer

In tough times, consumers may change what they want and can afford, where and how they shop, even what they want to see and hear from a firm. A downturn is an opportunity for marketers to learn even more about what consumers are thinking, feeling, and doing, especially the loyal customer base that is the source of so much of a brand’s profitability. Any changes must be identified and characterized as temporary adjustments versus permanent shifts.

### Rethink How You Spend Your Money

Budget allocations can be sticky and not change enough to reflect a fluid marketing environment. A recession provides an opportunity for marketers to closely review how much and in what ways they are spending their money. Budget reallocations can allow marketers to try new, promising options and eliminate sacred-cow approaches that no longer provide sufficient revenue benefits.

### Put Forth the Most Compelling Value Proposition

It’s a mistake in a recession to be overly focused on price reductions and discounts that can harm long-term brand equity and price integrity. Marketers should focus on increasing—and clearly communicating—the value their brands offer consumers, making sure consumers appreciate all the financial, logistical, and psychological benefits compared with the competition.

### Fine-Tune Your Brand and Product Offerings

Marketers must make sure they have the right products to sell to the right consumers in the right places and times. They should carefully review their product portfolios and brand architecture to ensure that brands and sub-brands are clearly differentiated and targeted, and that optimal support is given to brands and sub-brands based on their prospects. Because certain brands or sub-brands appeal to different economic segments, those that target the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum may be particularly important during a recession. Bad times also are an opportunity to prune brands or products that have diminished prospects.

With so many brands engaged in expansion, channels of distribution have become clogged, and many brand battles are waged just to get products on the shelf. The average supermarket now holds 30,000 different brands, three times the number 30 years ago.³⁵

## Media Transformation

Another important change in the marketing environment is the erosion or fragmentation of traditional advertising media and the emergence of interactive and nontraditional media, promotion, and other communication alternatives. For several reasons related to media cost, clutter, and fragmentation—as outlined in Chapter 6—marketers have become disenchanted with traditional advertising media, especially network television.

Thus the percentage of the communication budget devoted to advertising has shrunk over the years. In its place, marketers are spending more on nontraditional forms of communication and on new and emerging forms of communication such as interactive digital media; sports and event sponsorship; in-store advertising; mini-billboards in transit vehicles, parking meters, and other locations; and product placement in movies.

Consider how the movie industry has dramatically changed its marketing communications in recent years. Movie studios collectively spent $2.9 billion in 2011 to advertise their movies on television. Lions Gate spent just $50 million to market *The Hunger Games* and generated $213 million in its opening weekend alone.
