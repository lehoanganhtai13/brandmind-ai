# LIZ CLAIBORNE

A company that found great success selling popular fashions to working women in the 1980s—generating $2 billion in annual sales by the early 1990s—Liz Claiborne found itself in serious trouble two decades later when sales started to cool. A brand transformation that eliminated some slower-selling older lines to focus on younger customers failed to turn the business around. Aging core customers deserted the brand, and department stores began to replace it with their own private labels. The company was posting annual losses by 2006, and sales dropped by half over the next five years. Management decided to retrench in 2011 and focus its resources on its faster-selling brands—Kate Spade, Lucky Brands Jeans, and Juicy Couture. The Claiborne and Monet brands were sold to JCPenney for $288 million, and as part of the sales agreement, Liz Claiborne was given one year to change its name. The firm was making another financial bet on a new brand strategy it hoped would prove more fruitful than the last one, while JCPenney was betting there was life left in the Liz Claiborne brand on which it could capitalize.¹⁷

## Residual Approaches

The rationale behind residual approaches is the view that brand equity is what remains of consumer preferences and choices after we subtract physical product effects. The idea is that we can infer the relative valuation of brands by observing consumer preferences and choices *if* we take into account as many sources of measured attribute values as possible. Several researchers have defined brand equity as the incremental preference over and above what would result without brand identification. In this view, we can calculate brand equity by subtracting preferences for objective characteristics of the physical product from overall preference.¹⁸

### Scanner Panel.

Some researchers have focused on analysis of brand value based on data sets from supermarket scanners of consumer purchases. In an early study, Kamakura and Russell proposed a measure that employs consumer purchase histories from supermarket scanner data to estimate brand equity through a residual approach.¹⁹ Specifically, their model explains the choices observed from a panel of consumers as a function of the store environment (actual shelf prices, sales promotions, displays), the physical characteristics of available brands, and a residual term dubbed brand equity. By controlling for other aspects of the marketing mix, they estimate that aspect of brand preference that is unique to a brand and not currently duplicated by competitors.

More recently, a variation proposed by Ailawadi, Lehmann, and Neslin employs actual retail sales data to calculate a “revenue premium” as an estimate of brand equity, by calculating the difference in revenues between a brand and a generic or private label in the same category.²⁰
