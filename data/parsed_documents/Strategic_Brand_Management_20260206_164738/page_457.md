**Corporate and Competitive Factors.**  
Marketers must take not only a consumer perspective in evaluating a proposed brand extension, but also a broader corporate and competitive perspective. How effectively are the corporate assets leveraged in the extension setting? How relevant are existing marketing programs, perceived benefits, and target customers to the extension? What are the competitive advantages to the extension as consumers perceive them, and possible reactions initiated by competitors as a result?

One of the biggest mistakes marketers make in launching extensions is failing to properly account for competitors’ actions and reactions. Too many extension products and too strongly entrenched competition can put a strain on company resources. Arm & Hammer’s brand extension program met major resistance in categories such as deodorants when existing competitors fought back.

Brand counterextensions—whereby a competing brand in the extension category chooses to launch its own extension into the parent brand’s category—can pose a significant threat. The introduction of Hershey’s strawberry syrup was followed by Smucker’s chocolate syrup; Dixie paper plates was followed by Chinet paper cups. A successful extension can reduce the perceived fit between categories, making it easier for a brand to counterattack.

**Category Factors.**  
Marketers must determine the optimal product line strategy for their brand. To do so, they need a clear understanding of the market and the cost interdependencies between products. This in turn means examining the percentage of sales and profits contributed by each item in the product line and its ability to withstand competition and address consumer needs.

A product line is too short if the manager can increase long-term profits by adding items; the line is too long if the manager can increase profits by dropping items. Increasing the length of the product line by adding new variants or items typically expands market coverage and therefore market share, but it also increases costs. From a branding perspective, longer product lines may decrease the consistency of the associated brand image if all items use the same brand.
