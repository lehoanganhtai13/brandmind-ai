# CONDUCTING BRAND AUDITS

A *brand audit* is a comprehensive examination of a brand to discover its sources of brand equity. In accounting, an audit is a systematic inspection by an outside firm of accounting records including analyses, tests, and confirmations.³ The outcome is an assessment of the firm’s financial health in the form of a report.

A similar concept has been suggested for marketing. A *marketing audit* is a “comprehensive, systematic, independent, and periodic examination of a company’s—or business unit’s—marketing environment, objectives, strategies, and activities with a view of determining problem areas and opportunities and recommending a plan of action to improve the company’s marketing performance.”⁴ The process is a three-step procedure in which the first step is agreement on objectives, scope, and approach; the second is data collection; and the third and final step is report preparation and presentation. This is an internally, company-focused exercise to make sure marketing operations are efficient and effective.

A brand audit, on the other hand, is a more externally, consumer-focused exercise to assess the health of the brand, uncover its sources of brand equity, and suggest ways to improve and leverage its equity. A brand audit requires understanding the sources of brand equity from the perspective of both the firm and the consumer. From the perspective of the firm, what products and services are currently being offered to consumers, and how they are being marketed and branded? From the perspective of the consumer, what deeply held perceptions and beliefs create the true meaning of brands and products?

The brand audit can set strategic direction for the brand, and management should conduct one whenever important shifts in strategic direction are likely.⁵ Are the current sources of brand equity satisfactory? Do certain brand associations need to be added, subtracted, or just strengthened? What brand opportunities exist and what potential challenges exist for brand equity? With answers to these questions, management can put a marketing program into place to maximize sales and long-term brand equity.

Conducting brand audits on a regular basis, such as during the annual planning cycle, allows marketers to keep their fingers on the pulse of their brands. Brand audits are thus particularly useful background for managers as they set up their marketing plans and can have profound implications on brands’ strategic direction and resulting performance.

## DOMINO’S PIZZA

In late 2009, Domino’s was a struggling business in a declining market. Pizza sales were slumping as consumers defected to healthier and fresher dining options at one end or to less expensive burger or sandwich options at the other end. Caught in the middle, Domino’s also found its heritage in “speed” and “best in delivery” becoming less important; even worse, it was undermining consumer’s perceptions of the brand’s taste, the number-one driver of choice in the pizza category. To address the problem, Domino’s decided to conduct a detailed brand audit with extensive qualitative and quantitative research.

Surveys, focus groups, intercept interviews, social media conversations, and ethnographic research generated a number of key insights. The taste problem was severe—some consumers bluntly said that Domino’s tasted more like the box than the pizza. Research also revealed that consumers felt betrayed by a company they felt they no longer knew. A focus on impersonal, efficient service meant that in consumers’ minds, there was no Domino’s kitchens, no chefs, not even ingredients. Consumers were skeptical of “new and improved” claims and felt companies never admitted they were wrong. Based on these and other insights, Domino’s began its brand comeback. Step one—new recipes for crust, sauce, and cheese that resulted in substantially better taste-test scores. Next, Domino’s decided not to run from criticism and launched the “Oh Yes We Did” campaign. Using traditional TV and print media and extensive online components, the company made clear that it had listened and responded by creating a better pizza. Documentary-type filming showed Domino’s CEO and other executives observing the original consumer research and describing how they took it to heart. Surprise visits were made to harsh critics from the focus groups, who tried the new pizza on camera and enthusiastically praised it. Domino’s authentic, genuine approach paid off.
