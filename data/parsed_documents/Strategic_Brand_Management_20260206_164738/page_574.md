Conversely, without a strong push campaign that convinces retailers of the merits of the product, the brand may fail to achieve adequate support or even be stocked at all. Thus, creative and cost-effective push and pull marketing programs must increase the visibility of the brand and get both consumers and retailers talking about it.

Because small businesses often must rely on word-of-mouth to create strong, favorable, and unique brand associations, public relations and low-cost promotions and sponsorship can be inexpensive means to enhance brand awareness and brand image. Noah Alper, cofounder of Noah’s Bagels, reached out to the Jewish community and transplanted New Yorkers in Northern California through well-publicized events and appearances that promoted the “authentic” nature of the bagel chain. Marketers of the PowerBar, a nutrient-rich, low-fat energy bar, used selective sponsorship of top marathon runners, cyclists, and tennis players and events like the Boston Marathon to raise awareness and improve image. Selective distribution that targets opinion leaders can also be a cost-effective means to implement a push strategy. Perrier bottled water and Paul Mitchell and Nexus shampoo were initially introduced to a carefully selected set of outlets before broadening distribution.

**Leverage as many secondary associations as possible.**  
Finally, another way for small businesses to build brand equity is to leverage as many secondary associations as possible. Consider any entity with potentially relevant associations—a highly regarded location, a well-known set of customers or any prestigious awards—especially those that help signal quality or credibility. Along those lines, to make the company appear “bigger” than it really is, a well-designed Web site can be invaluable.
