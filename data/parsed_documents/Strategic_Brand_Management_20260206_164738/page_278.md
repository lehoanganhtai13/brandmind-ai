Disney started licensing its characters for toys made by Mattel in the 1950s. Disney Consumer Products (DCP) ranked as the number-one global licensor in 2010, reporting $28.6 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise worldwide. DCP’s *Toy Story* franchise, driven by box office success and merchandise demand for *Toy Story 3*, was the most dominant property of the year at retail, generating $2.4 billion in retail sales. The timeless Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh franchises combine to make up roughly a third of the division’s total revenue. Much newer franchises—Disney Princesses and Disney Fairies launched in 2000 and 2002 respectively—already combine to make almost a quarter of DCP’s total revenue. Artists in Disney Licensing’s Creative Resources department work closely with manufacturers on all aspects of product marketing, including design, prototyping, manufacturing, packaging, and advertising. Disney’s acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in August 2009 for $4 billion, a wholly owned subsidiary, opened a new world of comic book characters and popular film adaptations such as *Thor* and *Captain America* in 2011 and *The Avengers* and *The Amazing Spider-Man* in 2012. Marvel produced worldwide retail sales of licensed merchandise for 2010 of $5.6 billion.

Entertainment licensing has certainly become big business in recent years. Successful licensors include movie titles and logos like *Harry Potter*, *Transformers*, and *Spider-Man*; comic strip characters such as *Garfield* and *Peanuts* characters; and television and cartoon characters from *Sesame Street*, *The Simpsons*, *SpongeBob SquarePants*, and others. Every summer, marketers spend millions of dollars in movie tie-ins as marketers look for the next blockbuster franchise.

Licensing can be quite lucrative for the licensor. It has long been an important business strategy for designer apparel and accessories, for example. Designers such as Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Pierre Cardin, and others command large royalties for the right to use their name on a variety of merchandise such as clothing, belts, ties, and luggage. Over the course of three decades, Ralph Lauren became the world’s most successful designer, creating a $5-billion-dollar business licensing his Ralph Lauren, Double RL, and Polo brands to many different kinds of products. Everyone seems to get into the act with licensing. Sports licensing of clothing apparel and other products has grown considerably to become a multibillion-dollar business.

Licensing can also provide legal protection for trademarks. Licensing the brand for use in certain product categories prevents other firms or potential competitors from legally using the brand name to enter those categories. For example, Coca-Cola entered licensing agreements in a number of product areas, including radios, glassware, toy trucks, and clothes, in part as legal protection. As it turns out, its licensing program has been so successful the company now sells a variety of products bearing the Coca-Cola name directly to consumers.

Licensing certainly carries risks, too. A trademark can become overexposed if marketers adopt a saturation policy. Consumers do not necessarily know the motivation or marketing arrangements behind a product and can become confused or even angry if the brand is licensed to a product that seemingly bears no relation. Moreover, if the product fails to live up to consumer expectations, the brand name could become tarnished.
