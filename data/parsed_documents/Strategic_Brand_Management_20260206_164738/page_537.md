## 8. Establish Operable Guidelines

The goal is for everyone within the organization to understand the brand’s meaning and be able to translate it to satisfy local consumer preferences. Brand definition and communication often revolve around two related issues. First, some sort of document, such as a brand charter, should detail what the brand is and what it is not. Second, the product line should reflect only those products consistent with the brand definition.

Coca-Cola has a strategy document that clearly articulates the company’s strategy and how the brand positioning is manifested in various aspects of the marketing mix elements. This document sets out the parameters for the brand and therefore determines how much is left to chance. Similarly, McDonald’s operating manual imposes rigorous worldwide controls (for example, the 19 steps to cook and bag french fries).

### COLGATE-PALMOLIVE

Colgate-Palmolive has been a highly successful global marketer for years because of its tight focus on marketing strategies and objectives. Colgate’s “bundle books” contain, down to the smallest details, everything that Colgate knows about any given brand—and that a country or regional manager needs to know. They describe how to effectively market a particular product, including the product attributes, formulas, ingredient sourcing information, market research, pricing positions, graphics, and even advertising, public relations, and point-of-sales materials. With a bundle book, a manager in any one of the more than 200 countries and territories where Colgate sells its products can project the brand exactly like every one of her or his counterparts. As one executive noted, 

> “As the smallest among our major competitors, we are trying to make sure that we maximize our resources. By having tightly controlled brands, we can leverage across borders rapidly.”[^75]

Colgate has learned how to successfully market in countries all over the world, such as by selling its products in small sachets in village shops all over India.

As an example of deriving product strategy from a brand definition, consider Disney. Everyone at the company is exposed to the Disney brand mantra, “fun family entertainment” (see Branding Brief 2-3). To establish global guidelines, Disney’s centralized marketing group worked with members of the consumer products group for months to assign virtually every possible product to one of three categories:

* Acceptable to license without permission (like T-shirts)
* Not permissible to ever license (such as toilet paper)
* Requires validation from headquarters to license (about 20 categories, including air fresheners) Internationally, Disney has noticed that the “gray areas” grow larger and more numerous.
