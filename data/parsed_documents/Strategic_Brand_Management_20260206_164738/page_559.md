# BRANDING BRIEF 15-2

## Reinvigorating Branding at Procter & Gamble

After struggling briefly at the turn of the twenty-first century, the company regained its reputation as the flag-bearer of marketing innovation and excellence under the direction of CEO A. G. Lafley, appointed in 2000. During Lafley’s decade-long tenure, aided by famed CMO Jim Stengel, P&G boldly reasserted its leadership, in part by following these four key strategies.

### Renewed Emphasis on R&D

In the first decade of the twenty-first century, one of the fastest-growing major corporations in revenue and profit was Procter & Gamble. Fueling its growth were successful new products such as Swiffer mop, a battery-powered Crest Spin-Brush toothbrush, Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, and Actonel (a prescription medication for osteoporosis). Many of these new products reflected innovation in what then CEO Lafley called “the core”—core markets, categories, brands, technologies, and capabilities.

To reinforce its innovation, P&G also placed a renewed emphasis on design by appointing its first-ever chief design officer in 2001 and installing a top design officer in each of its global business units. Lafley emphasized the importance of design in combination with innovation, saying, “When we consciously involved design at the front end—such as with Crest Whitestrips . . . and our whole line of Swiffer quick-clean products—we generated more trial, more repurchase, and more sales.”

To more effectively grow its core, P&G also adopted a “connect and develop” model that emphasized the pursuit of outside innovation. The firm collaborates with organizations and individuals around the world, searching for proven technologies, packages, and products it can improve, scale up, and market on its own or in partnership with other companies. It has strong relationships with external designers, distributing product development around the world to increase what it calls

“consumer sensing.” P&G has made it a goal for 50 percent of new products to come from outside its labs—from inventors, scientists, and suppliers whose new-product ideas can be developed in-house.

### New Communication Approaches

P&G has been shifting its ad budget away from TV advertising and toward “media-neutral” advertising, which determines media spending without bias toward any particular medium

brands and to maximize brand equity *and* customer equity. Brands serve as the “bait” that retailers and other channel intermediaries use to attract customers from whom they extract value. Customers serve as the tangible profit engine for marketers to monetize their brand value.

However, for even the most customer-centric companies, the increasing diversity and “empowerment” of customers offer significant branding challenges.

### Customer Diversity.

Multiple segments and sub-segments of consumers typically make up a customer franchise for a brand. We define these segments using many dimensions; some of the most challenging are cultures and geographies. A multicultural perspective in branding is a necessity in today’s diverse world in order to directly affect all types of target consumers or groups. It also helps marketers focus on the *overall* relevance of their brand and how they can effectively adapt it to all segments in their target market.
