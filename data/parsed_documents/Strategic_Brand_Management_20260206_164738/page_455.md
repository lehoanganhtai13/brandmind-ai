> Steps in Successfully Introducing Brand Extensions

1. Define actual and desired consumer knowledge about the brand (e.g., create mental map and identify key sources of equity).  
2. Identify possible extension candidates on basis of parent brand associations and overall similarity or fit of extension to the parent brand.  
3. Evaluate the potential of the extension candidate to create equity according to the three-factor model:  
   * Salience of parent brand associations  
   * Favorability of inferred extension associations  
   * Uniqueness of inferred extension associations  
4. Evaluate extension candidate feedback effects according to the four-factor model:  
   * How compelling the extension evidence is  
   * How relevant the extension evidence is  
   * How consistent the extension evidence is  
   * How strong the extension evidence is  
5. Consider possible competitive advantages as perceived by consumers and possible reactions initiated by competitors.  
6. Design marketing campaign to maximize the likelihood of success and potential positive feedback effects.  
7. Evaluate extension success and effects on parent brand equity.

Must know what is to be the basis of positioning and core benefits satisfied by the brand. Profiling actual and desired brand knowledge structures helps identify possible brand extensions as well as guide decisions that contribute to their success. In evaluating an extension, a company must understand where it would like to take the brand in the long run. Because the introduction of an extension can change brand meaning, it can affect consumer response to all subsequent marketing activity as well (see Chapter 13).

### Identify Possible Extension Candidates

Chapter 11 described a number of consumer, firm, and competitor criteria for choosing which products and markets a firm should enter. With respect to consumer factors, marketers should consider parent brand associations—especially as they relate to brand positioning and core benefits—and product categories that might seem to fit with that brand image in the minds of consumers.<sup>45</sup> Although consumers are generally better able to react to an extension concept than to suggest one, it still may be instructive to ask consumers what products the brand should consider offering if it were to introduce a new product. Brainstorming is another way to generate category extension candidates, along with consumer research.

One or more associations can often serve as the basis of fit. Beecham marketed Lucozade in Britain for years as a glucose drink to combat dehydration and other maladies of sick children. By introducing new flavor formulas, packaging formats, and so forth, Beecham was able to capitalize on the association of the brand as a “fluid replenisher” to transform its meaning to “a healthy sports drink for people of all ages.” Reinforced by ads featuring the famous British Olympic decathlete Daley Thompson, sales and profits for the brand increased dramatically. Thus, by recognizing that Lucozade did not have to be just a pharmaceutical product but could be repositioned through brand extensions and other marketing activity as a healthy and nutritious drink, Beecham was able to credibly transform the brand.<sup>46</sup>

### Evaluate the Potential of the Extension Candidate

In forecasting the success of a proposed brand extension, marketers should assess—through judgment and research—the likelihood that the extension will realize the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of brand extensions, as summarized in Figures 12-2 and 12-4. As with any new product, analysis of the 3 Cs—consumer, corporate, and competitive factors—as well as category factors can be useful.
