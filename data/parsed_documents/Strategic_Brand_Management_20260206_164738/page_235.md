# EL-EZABY IN EGYPT

Despite the legal constraints which prohibit certain advertising activities for pharmaceutical products, El-Ezaby, one of Egypt’s leading pharmacy chains (http://www.multipharma-eg.com/el-ezaby.php), engages in multi-faceted communications covering outdoor ads, print advertising, consumer promotions, digital marketing/display screens, and SMS/mobile communications. El-Ezaby’s marketing team tailors each campaign’s creative strategy to different audiences. For instance, in Alexandria, the company utilized the campaign slogan “Now You Are Covered,” emphasizing the reach and convenience of store locations. Furthermore, customer satisfaction surveys are continuously conducted in order to highlight and emphasize the company’s customer-centric strategy. Because of El-Ezaby’s firm belief in the inimitable competitive advantage of employees as brand ambassadors, the pharmacy chain engages in ongoing training through its in-house training academy and conducts mystery shopping trips to evaluate branch, and brand, performance.

One example of a strong brand-building program developed by El-Ezaby is the series of health care events it has run at local clubs and housing compounds. The aim of these events is to boost consumer awareness of the brand by targeting different social classes and promoting health consciousness. For instance, in 2012, El-Ezaby conducted a skincare day targeting females and teenagers of the higher and upper-middle socioeconomic classes in Rehab, New Cairo City. Multiple communication channels were used during the campaign, which used the slogan “We Care for You.” Some of the strategies used included:

* Heavy distribution of the event flyers in El-Ezaby branches before the event.
* Sending SMS messages to people living in the area with the assistance of telecommunication companies.
* Inviting leading physicians to share their expertise of skin conditions during the event and endorsing this in the prior campaign communications.
* Distributing free samples of skin care products during the event.
* Measuring body weight, body fat percentage, and recommending dietary programs.
* Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies that offer children’s products while engaging in child-targeted activities like face painting to attract families to the event.

The campaign had a major effect on boosting consumer awareness: footfall in the stores hosting the campaign increased by 25 percent, and sales by 10 percent.<sup>43</sup>
