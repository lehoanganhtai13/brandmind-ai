Advocates of the ethnographic approach have sent researchers to consumers’ homes in the morning to see how they approach their days, given business travelers digital cameras and diaries to capture their feelings when in hotel rooms, and conducted “beeper studies” in which participants are instructed to write down what they’re doing when they are paged or texted.  
Marketers such as Procter & Gamble seek consumers’ permission to spend time with them in their homes to see how they actually use and experience products. Some of the many other companies that have used ethnographic research to study consumers include Best Western (to learn how seniors decide when and where to shop), Moen (to observe over an extended time how customers really use their shower devices), and Intel (to understand how people use mobile communications in moving around a city). A comprehensive ethnographic research study for JCPenney on their wedding registry resulted in a complete makeover at all levels. Consider how ethnographic research paid off for Hewlett-Packard (HP).

## HEWLETT-PACKARD (HP)

To better understand how surgeons operate, HP’s medical products division sent a set of researchers into hospitals to observe. Surgeons need to carefully monitor their scalpel movements on a video monitor. During an operation, however, the researchers observed that many other staff members would cross in front of the monitor, obscuring the surgeon’s line of sight. Because these staff members were going about their duties, the surgeons had failed to complain and prior research had failed to uncover the problem. Based on this research insight, HP developed a surgical helmet with goggles that cast images right in front of a surgeon’s eyes, circumventing the problem.

Business-to-business firms can also benefit from company visits that help to cement relationships and supplement research efforts. Technology firms such as Hewlett-Packard use cross-functional customer visits as a market research tool to gain a competitive advantage.
