festival in North America for years. Multiple revenue sources are generated through ticket sales (from $250 general admission to $18,500 luxury packages), 16 profit centers on-site (from concessions and merchandise to paid showers), licensing, media deals, and the Web. With all its success, festival organizers are exploring expanding the brand’s “curatorial voice” to nonfestival settings such as television programming and mobile phone apps.

2. Halloween night in Madison, Wisconsin, home of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, had become frightening—literally—for local businesses due to out-of-control partying. As one participant put it, “The main objective on Halloween in Madison was not to get blackout drunk . . . it was to incite enough of a ruckus that riot police had to show up on horseback with tear gas and pepper spray.” The success of that strategy was evident in 2005 when more than 450 people were arrested and $350,000 was spent by the town government on enforcement. The next year, the mayor of Madison tried a marketing solution instead. He branded the event “Freakfest,” installing floodlights in a gated stretch of a main street and providing concert entertainment for 50,000 partygoers. The number of arrests and the amount of vandalism were dramatically lower. One town official observed, “Since we rebranded the event, it’s become something we are proud of.”

As another example, Branding Brief 1-2 considers how even one-time commodities have been branded.

We can recognize the universality of branding by looking at some different product applications in the categories we defined previously—physical goods, services, retail stores, online businesses, people, organizations, places, and ideas. For each of these different types of products, we will review some basic considerations and look at examples. (We consider some of these special cases in more detail in Chapter 15.)

## Physical Goods

Physical goods are what are traditionally associated with brands and include many of the best-known and highly regarded consumer products, like Mercedes-Benz, Nescafé, and Sony. More and more companies selling industrial products or durable goods to other companies are recognizing the benefits of developing strong brands. Brands have begun to emerge among certain types of physical goods that never supported brands before. Let us consider the role of branding in industrial “business-to-business” products and technologically intensive “high-tech” products.

### Business-to-business products.

The business-to-business (B2B) market makes up a huge percentage of the global economy. Some of the world’s most accomplished and respected brands belong to business marketers, such as ABB, Caterpillar, DuPont, FedEx, GE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Siemens.

Business-to-business branding creates a positive image and reputation for the company as a whole. Creating such goodwill with business customers is thought to lead to greater selling A *commodity* is a product so basic that it cannot be physically differentiated from competitors in the minds of consumers.
