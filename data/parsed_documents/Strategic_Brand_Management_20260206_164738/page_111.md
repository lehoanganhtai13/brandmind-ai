# Beverage Category Hierarchy

This table outlines a hierarchical classification of beverages, starting with a broad category of "Beverages" that branches into "Water" and "Flavored" types. The "Flavored" category further divides into "Nonalcoholic" and "Alcoholic" subcategories. Under "Nonalcoholic," specific examples include "Milk," "Juices," "Hot beverages," and "Soft drinks." The "Alcoholic" category encompasses "Wine," "Beer," and "Distilled spirits." This structure presents a comparative breakdown of beverage types based on their primary characteristics and alcohol content.

Beverage Category Hierarchy

The organization of the product category hierarchy that generally prevails in memory will play an important role in brand awareness, brand consideration, and consumer decision making. For example, consumers often make decisions in a top-down fashion, first deciding whether to have water or some type of flavored beverage. If the consumer chooses a flavored drink, the next decision would be whether to have an alcoholic or a nonalcoholic drink, and so on. Finally, consumers might then choose a particular brand within the product category in which they are interested.

The depth of brand awareness will influence the likelihood that the brand comes to mind, whereas the breadth of brand awareness describes the different types of situations in which the brand might come to mind. In general, soft drinks have great breadth of awareness in that they come to mind in a variety of different consumption situations. A consumer may consider drinking one of the different varieties of Coke virtually any time, anywhere. Other beverages, such as alcoholic beverages, milk, and juices, have much more limited perceived consumption situations.

### Strategic Implications.

The product hierarchy shows us that not only the depth of awareness matters but also the breadth. In other words, the brand must not only be top-of-mind and have sufficient “mind share,” but it must also do so at the right times and places.

Breadth is an oft-neglected consideration, even for brands that are category leaders. For many brands, the key question is not *whether* consumers can recall the brand but *where* they think of it, *when* they think of it, and how *easily* and how *often* they think of it. Many brands and products are ignored or forgotten during possible usage situations. For those brands, the best route for improving sales may be not to try to improve consumer attitudes but, instead, increasing brand salience and the breadth of brand awareness and situations in which consumers would consider using the brand to drive consumption and increase sales volume.

Tax preparer H&R Block makes a concerted effort to make sure its brand is top-of-mind at all times, reminding consumers that tax-pertinent events happen all year round, such as when taking clients out to dinner, buying a new laptop computer, or looking for a new job.<sup>3</sup> Consider the brand salience challenges for the city of Newcastle in Australia.

## NEWCASTLE, AUSTRALIA

Newcastle is the seventh largest city in Australia. It is approximately two hours north of Sydney NSW and has a population of almost half a million people. In its early history Newcastle had strong industrial roots and was known as “the steel city.” However, since the early 1980s it has increasingly focused more on engineering, education, tourism, and health services and less on heavy industry. Unfortunately, even in 2010 many internal and external stakeholders still held the misperception of Newcastle as being solely an industrial city, and this has impeded its regional economic development.
