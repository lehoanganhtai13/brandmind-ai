# Phillips Van-Heusen Brand Price Tiers

This data outlines a hierarchical distribution strategy for various fashion brands, correlating specific brands with their respective distribution channels and price ranges. The structure moves from high-end to mass-market channels, with "Collection stores" at the apex, featuring premium brands like "Calvin Klein Collection," "ck Calvin Klein," and "BCBG Max Azria." As the channels descend through "Specialty stores" (e.g., "Sean John," "Kenneth Cole New York") and various tiers of department stores ("Premier department stores," "Department stores," "Mid-tier department stores"), the brand offerings become more accessible, including names like "Calvin Klein," "MICHAEL Michael Kors," "BCBG Attitude," "Kenneth Cole Reaction," "Geoffrey Beene," "IZOD," and "Bass." The strategy culminates in "Company stores" and "Discount stores," which carry brands such as "Chaps," "Van Heusen," and "Arrow." A consistent, broad price range, from $10,000 down to $10, spans all these distribution levels, indicating a wide spectrum of product pricing across the entire brand portfolio and its market reach.

## Understanding Consumer Price Perceptions

Economists traditionally assumed that consumers were “price takers” who accepted prices as given. However, as Ofir and Winer note, consumers and customers often actively process price information, interpreting prices in terms of their knowledge from prior purchasing experience, formal communications such as advertising, informal communications from friends or family members, and point-of-purchase or online information. Consumer purchase decisions are based on consumers’ perceived prices, however, not the marketer’s stated value. Understanding how consumers arrive at their perceptions of prices is thus an important marketing priority.

Much research has shown that surprisingly few consumers can recall specific prices of products accurately, although they may have fairly good knowledge of the relevant range of prices. When examining or considering an observed price, however, consumers often compare it with internal frames of reference (prices they remember) or external frames of reference (a posted “regular retail price”). Internal reference prices occur in many forms, such as the following:

* “Fair price” (what product should cost)
* Typical price
* Last price paid
* Upper-bound price (the most consumer would pay)
* Lower-bound price (the least consumer would pay)
* Competitive prices
* Expected future price
* Usual discounted price

When consumers evoke one or more of these frames of reference, their perceived price can vary from the stated price. Most research on reference prices has found that “unpleasant surprises,” such as a stated price higher than the perceived price, have a greater impact on purchase likelihood than pleasant surprises.

Consumer perceptions of prices are also affected by alternative pricing strategies. For example, research has shown that a relatively expensive item can seem less expensive if the price is broken down into smaller units (a $500 annual membership seems pricier than “less than $50 a month”). One reason prices often end with the number nine (as in, say, $49.99) is that consumers process prices in a left-to-right manner rather than holistically or by rounding. This effect is more pronounced when competing products’ prices are numerically and psychologically closer together.

Even the competitive environment has been shown to affect consumer price judgments: deep discounts (like everyday low pricing or EDLP) can lead to lower perceived prices over time than frequent, shallow discounts (high-low pricing or HILO), even if the average prices are the same in both cases. Clearly, consumer perceptions of price are complex and depend on the pricing context involved.
