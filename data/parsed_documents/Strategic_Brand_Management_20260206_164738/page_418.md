## LANCIA

In 2009, Fiat acquired the struggling Chrysler Group. The first visible results of the acquisition in terms of products were launched in 2011 with facelift versions of the Chrysler Town & Country, and Chrysler 200 as well as the next generation of the Chrysler 300. It was decided that those models would be offered in Europe under the Lancia brand which is also part of the Fiat brand portfolio. In addition to the genuine Lancia models Ypsilon, Musa, and Delta, the product range was extended with selling the Chrysler 300 as the new Lancia Thema, and the Chrysler Town & Country as Lancia Voyager (both models were sold before under the Chrysler brand in Europe). The statement “New Lancia. Luxury liberated” was used in the new product range’s commercials. The statement shows the ambition of Lancia to be the luxury choice in the corresponding car categories. The strategy has had some negative reaction. For example in Europe, neither Chrysler nor Lancia fans have been very enthusiastic about seeing an American product under the Italian car brand—just being sold with a new logo.[52]
