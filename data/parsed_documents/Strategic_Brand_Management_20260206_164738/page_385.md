Investors put capital into a company to ensure it can operate on a day-to-day basis. This money does not come free, as investors expect a return on their investment. While accountants are happy to accept the difference between revenue and expenses as the company’s profit, economists believe that true profit is accounting profit less the expected return on the company’s capital employed: the investors’ funds.

60. In February 2006, FASB and IASB signed a memorandum of understanding setting out the relationship priorities that would bring about a harmonization of their respective standards. We refer to the ISAB in this appendix given that the standards involved are largely harmonized.

61. In June 2011, the IASB invited comments on topics that should be included in its three-year research agenda for the period 2012 to 2015. Among others, the Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) submitted a letter arguing that IAS 38 should be on the agenda in order to iron out the variability between the two standards (IFRS 3 and IAS 38). IASB stated that it would reach and announce its decision between March and May 2012. If IAS 38 were to be added to the agenda, experts believe that in all likelihood, brands would be balance sheet items within two to three years regardless of whether they are internally generated or acquired.
