This table presents a comparative ranking of brand strength across six different countries: USA, UK, Germany, France, Brazil, and China, with varying years of data collection (2009 and 2011). The structure is hierarchical, with a "Brand Strength Rank" from 1 to 10 serving as the primary organizational element. For each rank, the table lists the corresponding brand or entity identified as strongest in each specified country. Key relationships are demonstrated through the direct association of a brand with its rank and country, allowing for cross-country comparisons of brand prominence at similar strength levels. For instance, at rank 4, Google is listed for the USA, IKEA for France, and Colgate for China, highlighting differing brand landscapes. The data reveals distinct top-performing brands in each market, ranging from technology companies like Google and Microsoft to media entities like Disney and Rede Globo, and even national entities like the United States and Germany themselves.

## Differences in Brand and Product Development and the Competitive Environment

Moreover, the perceptions and positions of particular brands may also differ considerably across countries. Figure 14-3 shows the results of a comprehensive study of leading brands (of all kinds, including people and country brands) in different parts of the world according to the BrandAsset Valuator measurement technique (see Brand Focus 9.0). Relatively few brands appear on all the lists, suggesting that, if nothing else, consumer perceptions of even top brands can vary significantly by geographic region.

The nature of competition may also differ. Europeans tend to see more competitors because shipping products across borders is easy. Germany’s *Mittelstand*—small and mid-sized companies with fewer than 500 people—employ more than 70 percent of German workers and contribute roughly half of the country’s GDP. They are especially formidable competitors. Blending high technology with a focus on quality, they weathered the recession well in Europe’s largest market (82 million people).<sup>26</sup>

## Differences in the Legal Environment

One of the challenges in developing a global ad campaign is the maze of constantly changing legal restrictions from country to country. At one time, laws in Venezuela, Canada, and Australia stipulated that commercials had to be physically produced in the native country. Canada banned prescription drug advertising on television. Poland required commercial lyrics to be sung in Polish. Sweden prohibited advertising to children. Malaysia did not allow lawyers or law firms to advertise. Advertising restrictions have been placed on the use of children in commercials in Austria, comparative ads in Singapore, and product placement on public television channels in Germany. Although some of these laws have been challenged or are being relaxed, numerous legal differences still exist.

## Differences in Marketing Institutions

Channels of distribution, retail practices, media availability, and media costs all may vary significantly from country to country, making implementation of the same marketing strategy difficult. Foreign companies struggled for years to break into Japan’s rigid distribution system that locks out many foreign goods. The penetration of cable television, cell phones, supermarkets, and so on may also vary considerably, especially in developing countries.

## Differences in Administrative Procedures

In practice, it may be difficult to achieve the control necessary to implement a standardized global marketing program. Local offices may resist having their autonomy threatened. Local managers may suffer from the “not invented here” syndrome and raise objections—rightly or wrongly—that the global marketing program misses some key dimension of the local market. Local managers who feel their autonomy has been reduced may lose motivation and feel doomed to failure.
