Although it can be difficult to judge the accuracy of some reports of past marketing failures, here are some of the more widely cited global branding failures reported over the years.

1. When Braniff translated a slogan touting its upholstery, “Fly in leather,” it came out in Spanish as “Fly naked.”
2. Coors put its slogan, “Turn it loose,” into Spanish, where it was read as “Suffer from diarrhea.”
3. Chicken magnate Frank Perdue’s line, “It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,” sounds much more interesting in Spanish: “It takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate.”
4. When Pepsi started marketing its products in China, it translated the slogan “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” pretty literally. In Chinese it really meant, “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave.”
5. Clairol introduced the “Mist Stick,” a curling iron, into Germany only to find out that mist is slang for manure in German.
6. Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors had to rename its Pajero model in Spanish-speaking countries because the term related to masturbation.
7. Toyota Motor’s MR2 model dropped the number in France because the combination sounded like a French swearword.

## MICHELIN MAN

Michelin recently launched a newer, slimmer version of its famous tubby Michelin Man (whose real name is Bibendum) to mark his 100th year. A company press release notes, “Thinner and smiling, Bibendum will look like the leader he is, with an open and reassuring manner.” Michelin has used the character to promote its brand values of research, safety, and environmentalism through the years. In 2000, Bibendum was voted the “greatest logo in history” in a competition sponsored by the *Financial Times*. In a 2009 global campaign that featured the character as a hero, the Michelin Man—which has been the exclusive focus of Michelin advertising since 2001—moved from a “more passive endorser to a more active problem solver.” Reinforced by the slogan “The Right Tire Changes Everything,” the new ad campaign emphasized the role tires play in people’s everyday lives.⁵

The Michelin Man—whose actual name is Bibendum—has served as the centerpiece of the tire brand’s advertising for years. Source: Michelin, North America From Calloway golf clubs to Louis Vuitton handbags, counterfeit versions of well-known brands are everywhere.
