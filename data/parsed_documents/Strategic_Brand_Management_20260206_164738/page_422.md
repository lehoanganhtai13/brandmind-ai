# BRAND ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

Brand architecture is a classic example of the “art and science” nature of marketing. It is important to establish rules and conventions and be disciplined and consistent. Yet at the same time, it is also important to be flexible and creative. There rarely are pure solutions to a brand architecture challenge, and no uniform agreement exists on the one type of branding strategy that all firms should adopt for all products. Even within a firm hybrid strategies often prevail, and marketers may adopt different branding strategies for different products.

For example, although Miller has long used its name across its different types of beer, with various sub-brands like Miller High Life, Miller Lite, and Miller Genuine Draft, it carefully branded its no-alcohol beer substitute as Sharp’s, its ice beer as Icehouse, and its low-priced beer as Milwaukee’s Best, with no overt Miller identification. The assumption was that the corporate family brand name would not be relevant to or valued by the target market in question.

The brand hierarchy may not be symmetric. Corporate objectives, consumer behavior, or competitive activity may sometimes dictate significant deviations in branding strategy and the way the brand hierarchy is organized for different products or for different markets.

Brand elements may receive more or less emphasis, or not be present at all, depending on the particular products and markets. For example, in an organizational market segment where the DuPont brand name may be more valuable, that element might receive more emphasis than associated sub-brands. In appealing to a consumer market segment, a sub-brand such as Teflon may be more meaningful; thus it received relatively more emphasis when DuPont is targeting that market. (See Figure 11-10.)

In evaluating a brand architecture strategy, we should ask a number of questions, such as:

* For the brand portfolio, do all brands have defined roles? Do brands collectively maximize coverage and minimize overlap?
* For the brand hierarchy, does the brand have extension potential? Within the category? Outside the category? Is the brand overextended?
* What positive and negative brand equity implications will transfer from the parent brand to individual products? What feedback exists from the individual products to the parent brands in turn?
* What profit streams result from different branding arrangements? How much revenue does each brand generate? At what cost? What other cross-selling opportunities exist between brands?

In answering these questions and in devising and implementing the optimal brand architecture strategy, marketers should keep the following five guidelines in mind.

1. **Adopt a strong customer focus.** Recognize what customers know and want, and how they will behave.  
2. **Create broad, robust brand platforms.** Strong umbrella brands are highly desirable. Maximize synergies and flow.  
3. **Avoid overbranding and having too many brands.** High-tech products, for example, are often criticized for branding every ingredient so the overall effect is like a NASCAR race car with logos and decals everywhere.

This table illustrates a three-tiered branding strategy, moving from a leveraged equity model to a product-balanced equity model, and finally to an endorsement brand. At the highest level, DuPont™ Teflon® represents the leveraged equity, signifying the broad recognition and trust associated with the DuPont brand. This is then distilled into the product-balanced equity of "Teflon," focusing the brand association directly onto the product itself. The endorsement brand level, "Enhanced with DuPont® science Teflon® for nonstick coatings," further refines this by explicitly linking the product's performance attributes (nonstick coatings) to the scientific backing of DuPont, creating a specific value proposition for consumers. This structure demonstrates a progression from a broad corporate association to a specific product benefit, leveraging the parent brand's reputation to enhance the perceived quality and innovation of the sub-brand.
