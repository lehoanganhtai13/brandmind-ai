Experiences can take all forms and are limited only by the marketers’ imagination. To create awareness of its Lumix ZX1 camera, with its optical zoom lens capable of rendering anything eight times its normal size, Panasonic placed gigantic attention-getting sculptures—an over-sized pigeon, traffic cone, coffee cup, and so on—around London, Edinburgh, and four other UK cities. The campaign was reinforced digitally by a Facebook contest in which camera users could shoot their own images distorting everyday objects with the camera’s zoom lens.⁶¹

Formally, *event marketing* can be defined as public sponsorship of events or activities related to sports, art, entertainment, or social causes. According to the International Events Group, event sponsorship has grown rapidly in recent years, to total $46.3 billion globally in 2010. The vast majority of event expenditures—68 percent—occur in the world of sports. Other categories are entertainment tours and attractions (10 percent), causes (9 percent), arts (5 percent); festivals, fairs and annual events (5 percent), and associations and membership organizations (3 percent).

Once employed mostly by cigarette, beer, and auto companies, sports marketing is now being embraced by virtually every type of company. Moreover, seemingly every sport—from dogsled racing to fishing tournaments and from tractor pulls to professional beach volleyball—now receives corporate backing of some kind. Chapter 7 examines the issues of event marketing and sponsorship in terms of the secondary associations that they bring to the brand.

### Rationale.

Event sponsorship provides a different kind of communication option for marketers. By becoming part of a special and personally relevant moment in consumers’ lives, sponsors can broaden and deepen their relationship with their target market. Marketers report a number of reasons why they sponsor events:⁶²

* *To identify with a particular target market or lifestyle:* Marketers can link their brands to events popular with either a select or broad group of consumers. They can target customers geographically, demographically, psychographically, or behaviorally, according to the sponsored events. In particular, marketers can choose events based on attendees’ attitudes and usage of certain products or brands. No athletic event in the United States attracts more “pentamillionaires”—those with a net worth of more than $5 million—than the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Perhaps it is no surprise that its sponsors include luxury brands such as Lexus, Tiffany, American Express, and Heineken, which largely target affluent customers.⁶³

* *To increase awareness of the company or product name:* Sponsorship often offers sustained exposure to a brand, a necessary condition to building brand recognition. By skillfully choosing sponsorship events or activities, marketers can enhance identification with a product and thus also brand recall. Waterford Crystal is well known for providing the crystal ball that drops down at midnight in New Year’s Eve in Times Square.

* *To create or reinforce consumer perceptions of key brand image associations:* Events themselves have their own associations that help to create or reinforce brand associations. Seiko has been the official timer of the Olympics and other major sporting events for years. Subaru believes there is a match in interests between skiing events and potential buyers of its all-wheel-drive vehicles.

* *To enhance corporate image dimensions:* Sponsorship is a soft sell and a means to improve perceptions that the company is likable, prestigious, and so forth. Marketers hope consumers will credit the company for its sponsorship and favor it in later product choices. Mountain Dew created the multicity Dew Tour, in which athletes compete in different skateboarding, BMX, and freestyle motocross events to reach and make a favorable impression with the coveted but fickle 12- to 24-year-old target market.

* *To create experiences and evoke feelings:* Events can be part of an experiential marketing program. The feelings engendered by an exciting or rewarding event may indirectly link to the brand. Marketers can also use the Web to provide further event support and additional experiences. At the “LG Experience” at the NCAA Final Four Bracket Town Fan Experience in March 2011, LG showcased its new line of 3-D televisions, mobile phones, and home appliances. The goal was to tap into the passion of spectators and transfer that passion to its brands and products. A bar-coded, scannable Fan Pass allowed LG to track attendees and what they saw and for how long.⁶⁴ * To express commitment to the community or on social issues: Often called cause-related marketing, sponsorships dedicated to the community or to promoting social issues create corporate tie-ins with nonprofit organizations and charities (see Chapter 11).
