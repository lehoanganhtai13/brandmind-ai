As is often the case with branding, the key is to mix and match channel options so that they collectively realize these goals. Thus, it is important to assess each possible channel option in terms of its direct effect on product sales and brand equity, as well as its indirect effect through interactions with other channel options.

## REVIEW

Marketing activities and programs are the primary means that firms build brand equity. Brand-building product, pricing, channel, and communication strategies must be put into place. In terms of product strategies, both tangible and intangible aspects of the brand will matter. Successful brands often create strong, favorable, and unique brand associations to both functional and symbolic benefits. Although perceived quality is often at the heart of brand equity, there is a wide range of associations that consumers may make to the brand.

Marketers are personalizing their consumer interactions through experiential and relationship marketing. Experiential marketing promotes a product by not only communicating a product’s features and benefits but also connecting it with unique and interesting consumer experiences. Relationship marketing includes marketing activities that deepen and broaden the way consumers think and act toward the brand. Mass customization, one-to-one, and permission marketing are all means of getting consumers more actively engaged with the product or service. Aftermarketing and loyalty programs are also ways to help create holistic, personalized buying experiences.

In terms of pricing strategies, marketers should fully understand consumer perceptions of value. Increasingly, firms are adopting value-based pricing strategies to set prices and everyday-low-pricing strategies to guide their discount pricing policy over time. Value-based pricing strategies attempt to properly balance product design and delivery, product costs, and product prices. Everyday-low-pricing strategies establish a stable set of “everyday” prices and introduce price discounts very selectively.

In terms of channel strategies, marketers need to appropriately match brand and store images to maximize the leverage of secondary associations, integrate push strategies and shopper marketing activities for retailers with pull strategies for consumers, and consider a range of direct and indirect distribution options.

In the next chapter, we consider how to develop integrated marketing communication programs to build brand equity.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Have you had any experience with a brand that has done a great job with relationship marketing, permission marketing, experiential marketing, or one-to-one marketing? What did the brand do? Why was it effective? Could others learn from that?

2. Think about the products you own. Assess their product design. Critique their aftermarketing efforts. Are you aware of all of the products’ capabilities? Identify a product whose benefits you feel you are not fully capitalizing on. How might you suggest improvements?

3. Choose a product category. Profile all the brands in the category in terms of pricing strategies and perceived value. If possible, review the brands’ pricing histories. Have these brands set and adjusted prices properly? What would you do differently?

4. Visit a department store and evaluate the in-store marketing effort. Which categories or brands seem to be receiving the biggest in-store push? What unique in-store merchandising efforts do you see?

5. Take a trip to a supermarket and observe the extent of private-label brands. In which categories do you think private labels might be successful? Why?
