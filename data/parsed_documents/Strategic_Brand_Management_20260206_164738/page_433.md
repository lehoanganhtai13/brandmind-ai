An important part of the process is the introduction of new products to help a brand grow and achieve its potential. Thus, this chapter considers in more detail the role of product strategy in creating, maintaining, and enhancing brand equity. Specifically, we’ll develop guidelines to improve the introduction and naming of new products and brand extensions.

Let’s start with a little historical perspective. For years firms tended to follow the lead of Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and other major consumer goods marketers that essentially avoided introducing any new products using an existing brand name. Over time, tight economic conditions, a need for growth, and competitive realities forced firms to rethink their “one brand–one product” policies. Recognizing that brands are among their most valuable assets, many firms have since decided to leverage that value by introducing a host of new products under some of their strongest brand names.

Many seek to build “power” or “mega” brands that establish a broad market footprint, appealing to multiple customer segments with multiple products all underneath one brand umbrella. Unilever’s Dove brand has made successful forays from its roots in soap into a range of skin care and body care products, backed by its “Campaign for Real Beauty” media campaign. At the same time, marketers are also realizing that too many product variations can be counterproductive, and ill-advised brand proliferation may actually repel consumers.

We’ve learned much about the best-practice management of brand extensions. This chapter begins by describing brand extensions and outlining their advantages and disadvantages. Then we present a simple model of how consumers evaluate brand extensions and offer managerial guidelines for introducing and naming new products and brand extensions. We conclude with a comprehensive summary of some of the key academic research findings on brand extensions. Brand Focus 12.0 provides a detailed checklist to help marketers evaluate the viability of a brand extension.

## NEW PRODUCTS AND BRAND EXTENSIONS

As background, first consider the sources of growth for a firm. One useful perspective is Ansoff’s product/market expansion grid, also known as the growth matrix. As in Figure 12-1, we can categorize growth strategies according to whether they rely on existing or new products, and whether they target existing or new customers or markets. Branding Brief 12-1 describes McDonald’s growth strategies along these lines.

Although existing products can further penetrate existing customer markets or push into additional ones (the focus of Chapter 13), new-product introductions are often vital to the long-run success of a firm. A discussion of all the issues in effectively managing the development and introduction of new products is beyond the scope of this chapter. Here we’ll simply address some brand equity implications of new products.<sup>1</sup>

First we’ll establish some terminology. When a firm introduces a new product, it has three choices for branding it:

1. It can develop a new brand, individually chosen for the new product.  
2. It can apply one of its existing brands.  
3. It can use a combination of a new brand and an existing brand.

This table presents a 2x2 matrix illustrating four distinct growth strategies, categorized by their focus on current versus new products and current versus new markets. The strategies are: Market Penetration, which involves selling current products to current markets; Product Development, focusing on new products for current markets; Market Development, which targets new markets with current products; and Diversification, encompassing the introduction of new products into new markets. This framework highlights how businesses can achieve growth by either deepening their presence in existing areas or expanding into novel ones, with varying degrees of risk and innovation associated with each approach. The structure is comparative, contrasting strategies based on two key dimensions of market and product orientation.
