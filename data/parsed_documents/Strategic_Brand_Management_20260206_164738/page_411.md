# BRANDING BRIEF 11-3

## Corporate Reputations: The Most Admired U.S. Companies

Two annual surveys offer insights into corporate reputation. Every year, *Fortune* magazine conducts a comprehensive survey of business perceptions of the companies with the best corporate reputations. The 2010 survey included the 1,400 largest U.S. and non-U.S. companies in 64 industry groups. More than 4,000 senior executives, outside directors, and financial analysts were asked to select the 10 companies they admired most, regardless of industry. To create industry lists, respondents rated companies in their industry on nine criteria:  
1. quality of management;  
2. quality of products or services;  
3. innovativeness;  
4. long-term investment value;  
5. financial soundness;  
6. ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people;  
7. responsibility to the community and the environment;  
8. wise use of corporate assets; and  
9. global competitiveness.

Many of the same companies make the list year after year; for example, Apple was number one from 2007 to 2010, and Procter & Gamble was in the top ten from 2005 to 2010. *Fortune*’s top ten most admired companies from 2010 and their rankings are as follows:

This data presents a ranked list of ten prominent companies, structured in two columns for clarity. The ranking spans from 1 to 10, with the first column detailing ranks 1 through 5 and the second column covering ranks 6 through 10. Key companies identified include Apple at rank 1, followed by Google (2), Berkshire Hathaway (3), Southwest Airlines (4), and Procter & Gamble (5). The subsequent ranks feature Coca-Cola (6), Amazon.com (7), FedEx (8), Microsoft (9), and McDonald’s (10). This hierarchical structure clearly delineates the top ten companies based on an unspecified ranking criterion.

Another informative survey, the RQ 2010 study of corporate reputations, conducted each year since 1999 by Harris Interactive and the Reputation Institute, demonstrated both the enduring character of corporate reputations but their ability to change quickly at the same time. Researchers determine which companies should be rated on the basis of a preliminary sampling of over 30,000 members of the U.S. general public, utilizing the proprietary Harris Poll online panel. Respondents are asked first to identify the 60 most visible companies and then to rate them on 20 different attributes that make up the Reputation Quotient (RQ) instrument. The attributes are then grouped into six different reputation dimensions: Emotional Appeal, Products & Services, Social Responsibility, Vision & Leadership, Workplace Environment, and Financial Performance. The study also includes a number of questions that help provide a comprehensive understanding of how the public perceived firms’ reputations. The 2010 rankings are as follows:

This data presents a ranked list of the top ten companies, divided into two columns for clarity. The first column details companies ranked 1 through 5: Google, Johnson & Johnson, 3M, Berkshire Hathaway, and Apple. The second column lists companies ranked 6 through 10: Intel, Kraft Foods, Amazon.com, General Mills, and Walt Disney Co. The structure is a simple comparative ranking, showcasing a discrete set of entities based on an unspecified metric, likely market value or influence, with a clear hierarchical ordering from highest to lowest rank.
