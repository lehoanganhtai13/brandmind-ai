Sustainability depends on internal commitment and use of resources as well as external market forces. Before encountering tough economic times, Applebee’s strategy for leadership in the casual dining restaurant business, in part, was to enter smaller markets where a second major competitor might be unlikely to enter—hello Hays, Kansas! Although there are downsides to such a strategy—potentially smaller volume and lethal word-of-mouth from any service snafus—competitive threats are minimal.<sup>52</sup>

## Establishing Points-of-Parity *and* Points-of-Difference

The key to branding success is to establish both points-of-parity *and* points-of-difference. Branding Brief 2-1 describes how the two major U.S. political parties have applied basic branding and positioning principles in their pursuit of elected office.

In creating both POPs and PODs, one of the challenges in positioning is the inverse relationships that may exist in the minds of many consumers. Unfortunately, as noted above, consumers typically want to maximize both the negatively correlated attributes and benefits. To make things worse, competitors often are trying to achieve their point-of-difference on an attribute that is negatively correlated with the point-of-difference of the target brand.

Much of the art and science of marketing is knowing how to deal with trade-offs, and positioning is no different. The best approach clearly is to develop a product or service that performs well on both dimensions. Gore-Tex, for example, was able to overcome the seemingly conflicting product image of “breathable” and “waterproof” through technological advances.

Several additional ways exist to address the problem of negatively correlated POPs and PODs. The following three approaches are listed in increasing order of effectiveness—but also increasing order of difficulty.

### Separate the Attributes.

An expensive but sometimes effective approach is to launch two different marketing campaigns, each devoted to a different brand attribute or benefit. These campaigns may run concurrently or sequentially. For example, Head & Shoulders met success in Europe with a dual campaign in which one ad emphasized its dandruff removal efficacy while another ad emphasized the appearance and beauty of hair after its use. The hope is that consumers will be less critical when judging the POP and POD benefits in isolation, because the negative correlation might be less apparent. The downside is that two strong campaigns have to be developed—not just one. Moreover, if the marketer does not address the negative correlation head-on, consumers may not develop as positive an association as desired.

### Leverage Equity of Another Entity.

Brands can link themselves to any kind of entity that possesses the right kind of equity—a person, other brand, event, and so forth—as a means to establish an attribute or benefit as a POP or POD. Self-branded ingredients may also lend some credibility to a questionable attribute in consumers’ minds.

SK-II, by Proctor & Gamble, is an excellent example of a brand “borrowing” or leveraging the equity of well-known and respected celebrities to lend credibility to its differentiation: an ability to clarify skin.

### SK-II

SK-II, a high quality skincare brand, was launched in 1980 by Proctor & Gamble (P&G) following its acquisition of Max Factor. Sales then grew organically, to exceed $1 billion per annum. SK-II sells strongly in Asia, but the brand has a global appeal.

The SK in SK-II stands for “secret key,” with “Pitera” revealed as the secret to clear skin. Pitera forms naturally in the yeast fermentation process, and comprises vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids, which stimulate the skin’s renewal cycle. SK-II products have a strong yeasty odor, which coupled with the ingredients and the story of how it was discovered, adds to the brand authenticity.

SK-II advertises through testimonials from high-profile celebrities in which they share the special secret on how they have crystal clear skin. The global brand appeal is mirrored in the international ambassador lineup: Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett, Malaysian artist Lee Sinje, Japanese director Kaori Momoi, Hong Kong model Qiqi, and Singaporean model Sheila Sim. SK-II has successfully changed a negative attribute—poor skin quality—into something that high-profile local celebrities are willing to discuss, as they have found a cure.<sup>53</sup>

Borrowing equity, however, is neither costless nor riskless. Chapter 7 reviews these considerations in detail and outlines the pros and cons of leveraging equity.
