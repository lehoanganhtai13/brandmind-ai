Different battles are now being fought between brands in different regions of the country. Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing have waged a fierce battle in Texas for years, where nearly 1 in 10 beers sold in the United States is consumed. Anheuser-Busch made sizable inroads during this time through special ad campaigns, displays, and sales strategies. As one observer noted,  
> “Texans believe it’s a whole different country down here. They don’t want you to just slap an armadillo in a TV spot.”[^4]

Regionalization can have downsides. Marketing efficiency may suffer and costs may rise with regional marketing. Moreover, regional campaigns may force local producers to become more competitive or blur a brand’s national identity. The upside, however, is that marketing can have a stronger impact.

## OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL SEGMENTS

Any market segment—however we define it—may be a candidate for a specialized marketing and branding program. For example, demographic dimensions such as age, income, gender, and race—as well as psychographic considerations—often are related to more fundamental differences in shopping behaviors or attitudes about brands. These differences can often serve as the rationale for a separate branding and marketing program. The decision ultimately rests on the costs and benefits of customized marketing efforts versus those of a less targeted focus.

For example, Chapter 13 described how important it is for marketers to consider age segments, and how younger consumers can be brought into the consumer franchise. Because of increased consumer mobility, better communication via social media and mobile phones, and expanding transnational entertainment options, lifestyles are fast becoming more similar *across* countries within sociodemographic segments, than they are *within* countries across sociodemographic segments. A teenager in Paris may have more in common with a teenager in London, New York, Sydney, or almost any other major city in the world than with his or her own parents. This younger generation may be more easily influenced by trends and broad cultural movements.
