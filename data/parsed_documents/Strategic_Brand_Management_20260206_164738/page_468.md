# LEVI’S TAILORED CLASSICS

In the early 1980s, Levi Strauss attempted to introduce a Tailored Classics line of men’s suits, targeted to independent-thinking “clotheshorses,” dubbed “Classic Individualists.” Although the suit was not supposed to need tailoring, to allow for the better fit necessary for these demanding consumers, Levi designed the suit slacks and coat to be sold as separates. It chose to price these wool suits quite competitively and to distribute them through its existing department store accounts, instead of the specialty stores where the classic individualist traditionally shopped. Despite a determined marketing effort, the product failed to achieve its desired sales goals. There were problems with the chosen target market, distribution channels, and product design, but perhaps the most fundamental problem was the lack of fit between the Levi’s informal, rugged, outdoor image and the image the company sought from its suits. Despite the ultimate withdrawal of the product, Levi Strauss later was able to execute one of the most successful apparel launches ever—Dockers pants—an extension much closer in fit and more strongly sub-branded. [104]

> As these experiences with brand extensions illustrate, failure does not doom a firm  
> *never* to be able to introduce any extensions—certainly not for a brand with as much equity as Levi. An unsuccessful extension does, however, create a “perceptual boundary” of sorts, in that it reveals the limits of the brand in the minds of consumers.

13. **Vertical extensions can be difficult and often require sub-branding strategies.** Some academic research has investigated vertical extension. In an empirical study of the U.S. mountain bicycle industry, Randall, Ulrich, and Reibstein found that brand price premium was positively correlated with the quality of the lowest-quality model in the product line for the lower-quality segments of the market; for the upper-quality segments of the market, brand price premium was also significantly positively correlated with the quality of the highest-quality model in the product line. They concluded that these results suggest managers wishing to maximize the equity of their brands should offer only high-quality products, although overall profit maximization could dictate a different strategy. [105]

Hamilton and Chernev show that upscale extensions increase the price image of a brand and downscale extensions decrease its price image when consumers are browsing or just looking around, but that does not necessarily apply when consumers are actively looking to make a purchase. In the latter case, the effects can even be reversed: upscale extensions may actually decrease price image and downscale extensions increase it if consumers have an explicit buying goal. [106]

Kirmani, Sood, and Bridges examined the “ownership effect”—whereby owners have more favorable responses than nonowners to brand extensions—in the context of brand line stretches. They found that the ownership effect occurred for upward and downward stretches of nonprestige brands (like Acura) and for upward stretches of prestige brands (like Calvin Klein and BMW). For downward stretches of prestige brands, however, the ownership effect did not occur because of owners’ desires to maintain brand exclusivity. In this situation, a sub-branding strategy protected owners’ parent brand attitudes from dilution. [107]

14. **The most effective advertising strategy for an extension is one that emphasizes information about the extension (rather than reminders about the parent brand).** A number of studies have shown that the information provided about brand extensions, by triggering selective retrieval from memory, may frame the consumer decision process and affect extension evaluations. In general, the most effective strategy appears to be one that recognizes the type of information already salient for the brand in the minds of consumers when they first consider the proposed extension, and that highlights additional information they would otherwise overlook or misinterpret.

Aaker and Keller found that elaborating briefly on specific extension attributes about which consumers were uncertain or concerned led to more favorable evaluations. Bridges, Keller, and Sood—as well as Klink and Smith—found that providing information could improve perceptions of fit when consumers perceived low fit between the brand and the extension, either by reinforcing an overlooked basis of fit or by addressing a distracting negative association. [108]

Lane found that repeating an ad that evoked primarily benefit brand associations could overcome negative perceptions of a highly incongruent brand extension. Moreover, for moderately incongruent brand extensions, even ads that evoked peripheral brand associations (say, via brand packaging or character) could improve negative extension perceptions with sufficient repetition. [109] Research has also explored several other aspects of extension marketing programs.
