This table outlines common pitfalls to avoid when naming a product or company. It highlights seven specific issues, including the overuse of generic terms like "Innovation" or "Solution," reliance on common English dictionary words which can lead to scarcity and linguistic problems, and the use of initials which require significant marketing investment to imbue with meaning. The table also cautions against employing terms such as "Extra" or "Plus" for product extensions, adopting unclear shorthand, combining too many names into a confusing brand, and soliciting suggestions from uninformed sources, as these approaches often fail to effectively communicate a company's strategy or resonate with customers. The overarching structure is a comparative list of undesirable naming strategies and their associated drawbacks.

2. *Generate names.* With the branding strategy in place, next generate as many names and concepts as possible. Any potential sources of names are valid: company management and employees; existing or potential customers (including retailers or suppliers if relevant); ad agencies, professional name consultants, and specialized computer-based naming companies. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of names may result from this step.

3. *Screen initial candidates.* Screen all the names against the branding objectives and marketing considerations identified in step 1 and apply the test of common sense to produce a more manageable list. For example, General Mills starts by eliminating the following:

* Names that have unintentional double meaning  
* Names that are unpronounceable, already in use, or too close to an existing name  
* Names that have obvious legal complications  
* Names that represent an obvious contradiction of the positioning  

Next General Mills runs in-depth evaluation sessions with management personnel and marketing partners to narrow the list to a handful of names, often conducting a quick-and-dirty legal search to help screen out possible problems.

4. *Study candidate names.* Collect more extensive information about each of the final 5–10 names. Before spending large amounts of money on consumer research, it is usually advisable to do an extensive international legal search. Because this step is expensive, marketers often search on a sequential basis, testing in each country only those names that survived the legal screening from the previous country.

5. *Research the final candidates.* Next, conduct consumer research to confirm management expectations about the memorability and meaningfulness of the remaining names. Consumer testing can take all forms. Many firms attempt to simulate the actual marketing program and consumers’ likely purchase experiences as much as possible.<sup>34</sup> Thus, they may show consumers the product and its packaging, price, or promotion so that they understand the rationale for the brand name and how it will be used. Other aids in this kind of research are realistic three-dimensional packages and concept boards or low-cost animatic advertising using digital techniques. Marketers may survey many consumers to capture differences in Based on all the information collected from the previous step, management should choose the name that maximizes the firm’s branding and marketing objectives and then formally register it.
