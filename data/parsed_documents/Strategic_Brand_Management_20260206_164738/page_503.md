Fundamentally, the issue is the existing and latent equity of the brand. As the former head of consumer packaged-goods giant Unilever commented in explaining his company’s decision to review about 75 percent of its brands and lines of businesses for possible sell-offs, “If businesses aren’t creating value, we shouldn’t be in them. It’s like having a nice garden that gets weeds. You have to clean it up, so the light and air get in to the blooms which are likely to grow the best.”<sup>32</sup>

## REVIEW

Effective brand management requires taking a long-term view and recognizing that any changes in the supporting marketing program for a brand may, by changing consumer knowledge, affect the success of future marketing programs. A long-term view also dictates proactive strategies designed to maintain and enhance customer-based brand equity over time, in the face of external changes in the marketing environment and internal changes in a firm’s marketing goals and programs.

Marketers reinforce brand equity by actions that consistently convey the meaning of the brand—what products the brand represents, what core benefits it supplies, what needs it satisfies, how it makes products superior, and which strong, favorable, and unique brand associations should exist in consumers’ minds. The most important consideration in reinforcing brands is consistency in the nature and amount of marketing support. Consistency does not mean marketers should avoid making any changes in the marketing program; in fact, many tactical changes may be necessary to maintain the brand’s strategic thrust and direction. Unless there is some change in the marketing environment or shift in strategic direction, however, there is little need to deviate from a successful positioning. The critical points-of-parity and points-of-difference that represent sources of brand equity should then be vigorously preserved and defended.

The strategy for reinforcing brand meaning depends on the nature of the brand association. For brands whose core associations are primarily product-related attributes and functional benefits, innovation in product design, manufacturing, and merchandising is especially critical to maintaining or enhancing brand equity. For brands whose core associations are primarily non-product-related attributes and symbolic or experiential benefits, relevance in user and usage imagery is especially critical to maintaining or enhancing brand equity.

In managing brand equity, managers have to make trade-offs between those marketing activities that fortify the brand and reinforce its meaning, and those that attempt to leverage or borrow from its existing brand equity to reap some financial benefit. At some point, failure to fortify the brand will diminish brand awareness and weaken brand image. Without these sources of brand equity, the brand itself may not continue to yield valuable benefits. Figure 13-3 summarizes brand reinforcement strategies.

Revitalizing a brand requires marketers to either recapture lost sources of brand equity or establish new ones. According to the CBBE framework, two general approaches are possible: (1) Expand the depth or breadth (or both) of brand awareness by improving brand recall and recognition by consumers during purchase or consumption settings; and (2) improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations making up the brand image. This latter approach may require programs directed at existing or new brand associations.

With a fading brand, the depth of brand awareness is often not a problem as much as the breadth; that is, consumers tend to think of the brand in very narrow ways. Although changing brand awareness is probably the easiest means of creating new sources of brand equity, we may often have to create a new marketing program to improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations.

As part of this repositioning, target markets should be analyzed carefully. It is often best to first retain new customers and then try to attract lapsed users or neglected segments before attempting to attract wholly different segments. The challenge in all these efforts to modify the brand image is not to destroy the equity that already exists. Figure 13-4 summarizes brand revitalization strategies.

Managers must also consider the role of different brands in the portfolio and their relationships over time. In particular, a brand migration strategy should ensure that consumers understand how various brands in the portfolio can satisfy their needs as they change or as the products and brands themselves change over time. Strategies exist to retire those brands whose sources of brand equity have essentially dried up or that have acquired damaging and difficult-to-change associations.

If a brand encounters a crisis, being swift and sincere are of paramount importance. Companies that come across as unresponsive or uncaring with their customers inevitably encounter problems.
