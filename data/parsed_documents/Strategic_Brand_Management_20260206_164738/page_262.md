* Salomon could leverage associations to the corporate brand by sub-branding the product—for example, by calling it “Avenger by Salomon.” Consumers’ evaluations of the new product extension would be influenced by the extent to which they held favorable associations about Salomon as a company or brand because of its skiing products, and how strongly they felt that such knowledge could predict the quality of a Salomon tennis racquet.
* Salomon could try to rely on its European origins (it is headquartered near Lake Annecy at the foot of the Alps), although such a location would not seem to have much relevance to tennis.
* Salomon could also try to sell through upscale, professional tennis shops and clubs in hopes that these retailers’ credibility would rub off on the Avenger brand.
* Salomon could attempt to co-brand by identifying a strong ingredient brand for its grip, frame, or strings (as Wilson did by incorporating Goodyear tire rubber on the soles of its ProStaff Classic tennis shoes).
* Although it is doubtful that a licensed character could be effectively leveraged, Salomon obviously could attempt to find one or more top professional players to endorse the racquet or could choose to become a sponsor of tennis tournaments, or even the entire professional ATP men’s or WTA women’s tennis tour.
* Salomon could attempt to secure and publicize favorable ratings from third parties like *Tennis* magazine.

Thus, independent of the associations created by the racquet itself, its brand name, or any other aspects of the marketing program, Salomon may be able to build equity by linking the brand to other entities in various ways.

This chapter first considers the nature of brand knowledge that marketers can leverage or transfer from other entities, and the process for doing it. We then consider in detail each of the eight different means of leveraging secondary brand associations. The chapter concludes by considering the special topic of Olympic sponsorship in Brand Focus 7.0.

## CONCEPTUALIZING THE LEVERAGING PROCESS

Linking the brand to some other entity—some source factor or related person, place, or thing—may create a new set of associations from the brand to the entity, as well as affecting existing brand associations. Let’s look at both these outcomes.¹

### Creation of New Brand Associations

By making a connection between the brand and another entity, consumers may form a mental association from the brand to this other entity and, consequently, to any or all associations, judgments, feelings, and the like linked to that entity. In general, these secondary brand associations are most likely to affect evaluations of a new product when consumers lack either the motivation or the ability to judge product-related concerns. In other words, when consumers either don’t care much about or don’t feel that they possess the knowledge to choose the appropriate brand, they may be more likely to make brand decisions on the basis of secondary considerations such as what they think, feel, or know about the country from which the product came, the store in which it is sold, or some other characteristic.

### Effects on Existing Brand Knowledge

Linking the brand to some other entity may not only create new brand associations to the entity but also affect existing brand associations. The basic mechanism is this. Consumers have some knowledge of an entity. When a brand is identified as linked to that entity, consumers may infer that some of the particular associations, judgments, or feelings that characterize the entity may also characterize the brand. A number of different theoretical mechanisms from psychology predict this type of inference. One is “cognitive consistency”—in other words, in the minds of consumers, what is true for the entity, must be true for the brand.²
