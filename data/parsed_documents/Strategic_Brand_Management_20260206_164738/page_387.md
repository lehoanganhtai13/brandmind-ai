Parts II, III, and IV of this book examined strategies for building and measuring brand equity. Part V takes a broader perspective and considers how to sustain, nurture, and grow brand equity under various situations and circumstances.

The successful launch of new products and services is of paramount importance to firms’ long-term financial prosperity. Firms must maximize brand equity across all the different brands and products and services they offer. Their brand architecture strategy determines which brand elements they apply across all their new and existing products and services and is the means by which they help consumers understand those products and services and organize them in their minds.

Many firms employ complex brand architecture strategies. For example, brand names may consist of multiple brand-name elements (Toyota Camry XLE) and may be applied across a range of products (Toyota cars and trucks). What is the best way to characterize a firm’s brand architecture strategy? What guidelines exist for choosing the right combinations of brand names and other brand elements to best manage brand equity across the entire range of a firm’s products?

We begin by outlining a three-step process to develop an effective brand architecture strategy. We next describe two important strategic tools—brand portfolios and brand hierarchies—which, by defining various relationships among brands and products, help characterize and formulate brand architecture strategies. We then consider corporate branding strategies. After outlining corporate image dimensions, we examine three specific issues in managing a corporate brand: corporate social responsibility, corporate image campaigns, and corporate name changes. Brand Focus 11.0 devotes special attention to the topics of cause marketing and green marketing.

## DEVELOPING A BRAND ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY

The firm’s *brand architecture strategy* helps marketers determine which products and services to introduce, and which brand names, logos, symbols, and so forth to apply to new and existing products. As we describe below, it defines both the brand’s breadth or boundaries and its depth or complexity. Which different products or services should share the same brand name? How many variations of that brand name should we employ? The role of brand architecture is twofold:

* To clarify brand awareness: Improve consumer understanding and communicate similarity and differences between individual products and services.
* To improve brand image: Maximize transfer of equity between the brand and individual products and services to improve trial and repeat purchase.

Developing a brand architecture strategy requires three key steps: (1) defining the potential of a brand in terms of its “market footprint,” (2) identifying the product and service extensions that will allow the brand to achieve that potential, and (3) specifying the brand elements and positioning associated with the specific products and services for the brand. Although we introduce all three topics here, this chapter concentrates on insights and guidelines into the first and third. Chapter 12 exclusively focuses on the second topic and how to launch successful brand extensions. The Science of Branding 11-1 describes a useful tool to help depict brand architecture strategies for a firm.

### Step 1: Defining Brand Potential

The first step in developing an architecture strategy is to define the brand potential by considering three important characteristics: (1) the brand vision, (2) the brand boundaries, and (3) the brand positioning.

**Articulating the Brand Vision.**  
*Brand vision* is management’s view of the brand’s long-term potential. It is influenced by how well the firm is able to recognize the current and possible future brand equity. Many brands have latent brand equity that is never realized because the firm is unable or unwilling to consider all that the brand could and should become.
