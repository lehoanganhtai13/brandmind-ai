# BRANDING BRIEF 1-3

## Place Branding

Branding is not limited to vacation destinations. Countries, states, and cities large and small are beginning to brand their respective images as they try to draw visitors or encourage relocation. Some notable early examples of place branding include “Virginia Is for Lovers” and “Shrimp on the Barbie” (Australia). Now virtually every physical location, area, or region considers place branding. More recent examples include Santa Rosa’s new slogan “Place of Plenty” and the “Cleveland Plus” campaign. The San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau ran an integrated campaign, titled “Happy Happens,” in 2009.

Las Vegas ran its hugely successful “What Happens Here, Stays Here” campaign beginning in 2003. The ads were meant to sell Las Vegas as an experience. In 2008, the city took a different route, selling Vegas differently and in more practical terms in light of the economy. The “What Happens Here” ads returned in 2009, however, when marketing research showed that consumers missed them. In 2010, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority had an $86 million advertising campaign budget, larger than the city’s top competitors’ budgets combined.

Branding countries to increase appeal to tourists is also a growing phenomenon. Some recent success stories include Spain’s use of a logo designed by Spanish artist Joan Miró, the “Incredible India” campaign, and New Zealand’s marketing of itself in relation to the *Lord of the Rings* movie franchise. Some other tourist slogans include “No Artificial Ingredients” for Costa Rica and “Mother Nature’s Best-Kept Secret” for Belize. Future Brand, a brand consultancy and research company, ranks countries on the strengths of their respective brands. In 2010, it deemed the top five country brands to be Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Switzerland.

### Geographic Locations

Increased mobility of both people and businesses and growth in the tourism industry have contributed to the rise of place marketing. Cities, states, regions, and countries are now actively promoted through advertising, direct mail, and other communication tools. These campaigns aim to create awareness and a favorable image of a location that will entice temporary visits or permanent moves from individuals and businesses alike. Although the brand name is usually preordained by the name of the location, there are a number of different considerations in building a place brand, some of which are considered in Branding Brief 1-3.

### Ideas and Causes

Finally, numerous ideas and causes have been branded, especially by nonprofit organizations. They may be captured in a phrase or slogan and even be represented by a symbol, such as AIDS ribbons. By making ideas and causes more visible and concrete, branding can provide much value. As Chapter 11 describes, cause marketing increasingly relies on sophisticated marketing practices to inform or persuade consumers about the issues surrounding a cause.

## WHAT ARE THE STRONGEST BRANDS?

It’s clear from these examples that virtually anything can be and has been branded. Which brands are the strongest, that is, the best known or most highly regarded? Figure 1-5 reveals Interbrand’s ranking of the world’s 25 most valuable brands in 2011 based on its brand valuation methodology (see Chapter 10), as published in its annual “Best Global Brands” report.<sup>30</sup>

We can easily find some of the best-known brands by simply walking down a supermarket aisle. It’s also easy to identify a number of other brands with amazing staying power that have been market leaders in their categories for decades. According to research by marketing consultant Jack Trout, in 25 popular product categories, 20 of the leading brands in 1923 were still leading brands over 80 years later—only five have lost their leadership position.<sup>31</sup> Similarly, many brands that were number one in the United Kingdom in 1933 remain strong today: Hovis bread, Stork margarine, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, Cadbury’s chocolates, Gillette razors, Schweppes mixers, Brooke Bond tea, Colgate toothpaste, and Hoover vacuum cleaners.
