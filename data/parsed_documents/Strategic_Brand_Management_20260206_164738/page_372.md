## Valuation Approaches

An increasingly widely held belief is that much of the corporate value of many companies is wrapped up in intangible assets, including the brand. Many studies have reinforced this point:  
* A survey reported by *Fortune* magazine in 2006 suggested that 72 percent of the Dow Jones market cap was made up of intangible assets.  
* Accenture estimated that intangibles accounted for almost 70 percent of the value of the S&P 500 in 2007, up from 20 percent in 2007.  
* Brand consultancy Brand Finance has estimated that brand value for Nike and Prada made up as much as 84 percent and 73 percent of total company value, respectively, in 2006.  

Recognizing that fact, many firms are interested in exactly what that brand value is. The ability to put a specific price tag on a brand’s value may be useful for a number of reasons:  
* *Mergers and acquisitions:* Both to evaluate possible purchases as well as to facilitate disposal  
* *Brand licensing:* Internally for tax reasons and to third parties  
* *Fund raising:* As collateral on loans or for sale or leaseback arrangements  
* *Brand portfolio decisions:* To allocate resources, develop brand strategy, or prepare financial reports  

For example, many companies appear to be attractive acquisition candidates because of the strong competitive positions of their brands and their reputation among consumers.  

Unfortunately, the value of the brand assets in many cases is largely excluded from the company’s balance sheet and is therefore of little use in determining overall value. It has been argued that adjusting the balance sheet to reflect the true value of a company’s brands permits us to take a more realistic view and assess the purchase premium to book value that might be earned from the brands after acquisition. Such a calculation, however, would also require estimates of capital required by brands and the expected after-acquisition return on investment (ROI) of a company.  

Separating out the percentage of revenue or profits attributable to brand equity is a difficult task. In the United States, there is no conventional accounting method for doing so. Some of Coca-Cola’s experiences with brand valuation are instructive here.

### COCA-COLA BRAND VALUATION

Despite the fact that expert analysts estimate the value of the Coca-Cola name in the billions of dollars, due to accounting convention, it appears in the company’s books as only $25 million. Based on accounting rules, Coca-Cola’s assets in 2004 had a book value of $31.3 billion, with various intangible assets assessed at $3.8 billion and a market cap of $100 billion.
