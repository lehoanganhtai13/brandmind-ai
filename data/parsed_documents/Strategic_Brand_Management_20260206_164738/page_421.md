It is important not to move too fast in rebranding. In updating brand architecture in any way, the goal is to at least preserve if not actually enhance brand equity as much as possible. Here are two companies that got ahead of themselves in their brand makeovers.

* As part of its strategy to become more of a national retailer, Macy’s acquired May Department Stores and Chicago retailing icon Marshall Field’s in August 2005. The Marshall Field’s flagship building on State Street, built in 1892 and covering a full city block, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. The department store occupied 8 of its 12 floors, and generations of Chicagoans had shopped there. When Macy’s almost immediately rebranded the store as Macy’s, replacing Marshall Field’s famous awnings, signage, and green shopping bags, a consumer uproar ensued. It took years for protests to die down.[59]

* When online retailer Overstock.com rebranded itself as O.co in June 2011, the company revamped its Web site and changed its advertising and sponsorship to reflect the new name. Unfortunately, many consumers began mistakenly going to the O.com Web site, which was *not* owned by the company. After six months, the company decided to return to Overstock.com on its Web site, in online ads, and in new TV ads “for now,” though not abandoning O.co outright. The O.co name was to still be used internationally, on mobile efforts, and on the Oakland NFL stadium sign. “We were going too fast, and people were confused, which told us we didn’t do a good job,” President Jonathan Johnson admitted.[60]

Initial reaction to rebranding is almost always negative, simply because people resist change. Sometimes, however, an especially harsh reception will cause a firm to abandon a new name. As Royal Mail began to distance itself a bit from the UK government, which owned a majority share, it tried to adopt a new name, Consignia. A public outcry ensued, and within a matter of months, the name was changed back to the original.[61] PriceWaterhouseCoopers tried to spin off its consulting unit to a new firm called Monday. The name was widely mocked, and within nine months the group was sold off and absorbed into IBM. The name change and branding were largely blamed for Monday’s lack of success.[62]

When UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, decided a new name was necessary to reflect the one-stop travel options that resulted from its acquisitions of Hertz car rental and Westin and Hilton International hotels, it chose the name “Allegis,” a compound of “allegiance” and “aegis.” Public reaction was decidedly negative. Critics maintained that the name was difficult to pronounce, sounded pretentious, and had little connection with travel services. Donald Trump, formerly a major UAL shareholder, said the new name was “better suited to the next world-class disease.” After six weeks and $7 million in research and promotion expenditures, the company decided to shed its car rental and hotel businesses and rename the surviving company United Airlines, Inc.[63]

Over time, though, if properly chosen and handled, new names gain familiarity and acceptance. Guidelines that encourage uniformity and consistency in the brand’s appearance and usage help make the implementation effective; these rules should be part of a revised brand charter (see Chapter 8).
