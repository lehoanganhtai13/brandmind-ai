# BRANDING BRIEF 14-4

## Managing Global Nestlé Brands

Thus, major acquisitions yielded valuable economies of scale to Nestlé in developed markets.

In less-developed markets, however, the company adopted a different strategy. Its entry strategy there was to manipulate ingredients or processing technology for local conditions and then apply the appropriate brand name—existing brands like Nescafé coffee, in some cases, and new brands, such as Bear brand condensed milk in Asia, in others. Nestlé strove to get into markets first and was patient; it negotiated for more than a decade to enter China. To limit risks and simplify its efforts in new markets, the company attacked with a handful of labels selected from a set of strategic brand groups. Then it concentrated its advertising and marketing money on just two or three brands.

Nestlé attempts to balance global and local control in managing its brands. Some decisions, such as branding, follow strict corporate guidelines. The company has six *strategic corporate brands*—Nestlé, Nescafé, Nestea, Maggi, Buitoni, and Purina. There are 70 different *strategic international brands*, including Nesquik line of chocolate milk products as well as product brands Kit Kat, Friskies, and Perrier. Eighty-three *strategic regional brands* include Aquarel and Contrex. Finally, there are a host of *local brands* that are only important to particular countries.

Nestlé had used a decentralized management approach, in which most decisions—apart from decisions about the worldwide and corporate brands—were primarily decided by the local managers. In 1997, following many acquisitions, a new CEO determined that Nestlé needed more formal central and regional control. The company consolidated factory management by region and combined oversight of similar products into strategic business units. Still, local managers retained the decision-making power necessary to adapt products to local tastes. For example, Nestlé continued to make 200 different varieties of its Nescafé instant coffee, each tuned to local palates.

Nestlé’s more centralized management approach enabled the company to focus on growing its core brands at each level. From 1999 to 2003, organic growth (excluding acquisitions) was 5.1 percent, almost double competitor Unilever’s organic growth rate of 2.7 percent. The rest of the decade saw Nestlé enjoy even more above-average market performance. Despite tough economic conditions, the company experienced organic growth of approximately 7.5 percent in 2011.

What types of products are difficult to sell through standardized global marketing programs? Many experts note that foods and beverages with years of tradition and entrenched customer preferences and tastes can be particularly difficult to sell in a standardized global fashion. Unilever has found that preferences for cleaning products such as detergents and soaps are more common across countries than preferences for food products.

High-end products can also benefit from standardization because high quality or prestige often can be marketed similarly across countries. Italian coffee maker illycafé maintained a “one brand, one blend” strategy across the globe for years, offering only a single blend of espresso made of 100 percent Arabica beans. As Andrea Illy, CEO of his family’s business, stated, 

> “Our marketing strategy focuses on building quality consumer perceptions—no promotions, just differentiating ourselves from the competition by offering top quality, consistency, and an image of excellence.”[^65]

The following are likely candidates for global campaigns that retain a similar marketing strategy worldwide:

* *High-technology products with strong functional images:* Examples are televisions, watches, computers, digital cameras, and automobiles. Such products tend to be universally understood and are not typically part of the cultural heritage. Taiwan’s HTC has employed its “quietly brilliant” brand positioning and “YOU” brand campaign to reinforce its reputation as one of the world’s most innovative smartphone providers.[^66]

* *High-image products with strong associations to fashionability, sensuality, wealth, or status:* Examples are cosmetics, clothes, jewelry, and liquor. Such products can appeal to the same type of market worldwide.
