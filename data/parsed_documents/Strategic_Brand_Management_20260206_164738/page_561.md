**Customer Empowerment.** Much has been made of the newly empowered consumer. One of the driving factors behind this trend is the greater transparency that now prevails in the marketing environment. The emergence of the Internet and social media—as well as the expansion and pervasiveness of traditional media—have given consumers the ability, for better or worse, to seek information and arrive at what they feel is “the truth” about products, services, and brands like never before. By merely being observant or proactive, consumers can find out and judge how well a product or service works or what a company is doing (or not doing) to the environment or their local community. Information and opinions can now travel around the world in mere minutes. Marketers must anticipate that any actions they take or claims they make will be scrutinized, deemed truthful or not, and shared with others almost instantaneously.

With this new transparency, consumers can undoubtedly be more actively involved in the fortunes of brands than ever before. But the reality is that only *some of the consumers* want to get involved with *some of the brands* they use and, even then, *only some of the time*. For consumers who do choose to become engaged at a deeper level, marketers must do everything they can to encourage them with social media and other marketing tools. But many consumers will choose *not* to do so, and it is crucially important to understand how to best market a brand given such diversity in consumer propensities, interests, and activity levels.

Moreover, even consumers who choose to become more engaged with a brand have undefined, ambiguous, or even conflicting preferences. They may need guidance and assistance in forming and conveying their preferences to firms. “Participation marketing” may then be a more appropriate concept for marketers to employ, because marketers and consumers need to work together to find out how the firm can best satisfy consumer goals. In participation marketing, consumers and firms freely exchange information to arrive at mutually beneficial solutions.<sup>7</sup> A highly successful premium brand, King Arthur Flour, has created a loyal online brand community by recognizing that baking is an activity consumers want to learn about and discuss with other consumers and company experts.

### 2. Go Beyond Product Performance and Rational Benefits

At the heart of a great brand is a great product or service. This is even more true in today’s highly transparent world. Many firms make the design aspects of products and services an increasingly crucial component of their value proposition, including adept marketers such as Apple, Nike, Ritz Carlton, Singapore Airlines, and Samsung. Developing better-designed products and services, however, requires a clear, comprehensive, up-to-date understanding of consumers and how they purchase and use products and services and think and feel about brands.
