business performance—the behavioral measures specific to a company’s business model. As an example, they note how the board of casino operator Harrah’s focuses on three metrics: share of its customer’s gaming dollars (share of wallet), loyalty program updates (an indicator of increased concentration of a customer’s gaming at Harrah’s), and percent of revenue from customers visiting more than one of Harrah’s 30 casinos (an indicator of cross-selling). To support its tracking, Harrah’s has spent $50 million annually on a customer information system.

Similarly, Ambler and Clark offer three recommendations. First, marketers must work with their CFO to develop marketing dashboards and to shift metrics and forecasting responsibilities to the finance department. Second, marketers should develop with each agency a detailed brief with measurable objectives and a results-driven compensation component (for agencies). Third, marketers need to dedicate extra time to securing buy-in from colleagues on their business model, strategy, and metrics.

In terms of choosing specific metrics for a brand equity report or dashboard, Ambler and Clark offer three additional guidelines. First, marketers must select metrics that suit their business model and strategy. Two, they need to balance their metrics portfolio across audiences, comprehensiveness, efficiency, and other considerations. Three, marketers should review and modify their metrics portfolio as their needs change.

With advances in computer technology, it will be increasingly easy for firms to place the information that makes up the brand equity report online, so managers can access it through the firm’s intranet or some other means. For example, early research pioneer NFO MarketMind developed a brand management database system that integrated continuous consumer tracking survey data, media weight (or cost) data, warehouse sales and retail scan data, and PR and editorial content.

### Brand Equity Responsibilities

To develop a brand equity management system that will maximize long-term brand equity, managers must clearly define organizational responsibilities and processes with respect to the brand. Brands need constant, consistent nurturing to grow. Weak brands often suffer from a lack of discipline, commitment, and investment in brand building. In this section, we consider internal issues of assigning responsibilities and duties for properly managing brand equity, as well as external issues related to the proper roles of marketing partners. The Science of Branding 8-2 describes some important principles in building a brand-driven organization.
