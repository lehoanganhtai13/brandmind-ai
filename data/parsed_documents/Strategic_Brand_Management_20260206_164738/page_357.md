# Figure 9-16 Brand Development Cycle as Illustrated by the Power Grid

This table presents a brand positioning framework, mapping brands based on two key dimensions: Brand Strength (Energized Differentiation and Relevance) and Brand Stature (Esteem and Knowledge). The framework is structured as a 2x2 matrix, with Brand Strength on the horizontal axis and Brand Stature on the vertical axis, though the table displays it in a columnar format. The vertical axis is segmented into three levels: 100 (high), 50 (medium), and 0 (low) for Brand Stature. The horizontal axis is implicitly divided into categories based on Brand Strength, with 'Leadership' and 'Niche' representing higher levels, and 'New, Unfocused or Unknown' and 'Commodity or Eroded' representing lower levels. Brands are categorized within these segments, with examples like Google, Nike, and Coca-Cola in the 'Mass Market' quadrant (high Brand Stature, high Brand Strength), and Facebook in the 'Leadership' quadrant (high Brand Strength, unspecified but implied high Brand Stature). Other brands like Lululemon and Method fall into a mid-level segment, while companies like Shell and American Airlines are positioned in the 'Commodity or Eroded' category (low Brand Strength, unspecified but implied low Brand Stature). The acronym 'DEREK' appears consistently, likely representing a proprietary scoring or evaluation system.

# Applying BAV to Google

The best way to understand the BAV model is to apply it to a brand and category. Google is a dramatic example. Google achieved leadership status faster than any other brand measured in BAV. Google built each brand pillar, beginning with Energized Differentiation, both quickly and strongly. After rapidly establishing Energized Differentiation, Google built the other three pillars. It took only three years for Google’s percentile-ranking on all four pillars to reach the high 90s.

At the same time, AOL began to falter, losing first Energized Differentiation, then Relevance and Esteem. For a while, AOL’s Knowledge remained high, but with declining Relevance, eroding Differentiation and less Esteem, consumers began to lose interest until finally, AOL’s Knowledge pillar followed the other pillars and began to decline. Figure 9-17 displays the sharp contrast in brand development between the two.

How has Google developed and maintained brand leadership? From the BAV perspective, there are three main contributing factors:  
1. Consistently strong brand attributes that translate into competitive advantages,  
2. Successful brand extensions into new categories, and  
3. Successful expansion into global markets and the fast establishment of brand leadership.

## Competitive Advantages on Brand Attributes

Google’s leadership is supported by competitive advantages on the factors that contribute to the strength of the key pillars. The BAV factors are created from the 48 brand image attributes, using data compiled from Google and its competitor brands. The individual attributes within each factor are the dimensions most correlated with each other through the eyes of consumers when considering Google and its competitive set; thus, factors define how consumers view the category and the brands within it.

As shown in Figure 9-18, Google is stronger than the competitive average on the *Cutting Edge* (innovation) factor and the *Bold* personality factor. Both of these factors build Google’s Energized Differentiation. Google’s advantage on the *Dependability* (trust) factor helps keep the Relevance pillar strong, and Google’s strength on the *Superiority* (best brand) factor supports both the Relevance and the Esteem pillars.

## Successful Category Extensions

Google has done a masterful job of entering new categories with sub-brands. In many of these categories—such as Google Maps, Android by Google, and Gmail—the Google entrant has become the category leader. Most of the sub-brands also have very high Brand Strength, which helps replenish the Brand Strength of the Google corporate brand (see Figure 9-19). In this way, the leadership of the sub-brands helps support the parent brand, a common theme among strong parent brands with sub-brands.

The significant strength of Google’s image profile has made entrance into new categories easier. Google does not face the entrance issues that weaker brands have when their image profiles are not robust enough to create differentiation in the new category, a key condition for a successful extension.

## Successful Global Expansion

BAV metrics uniquely gauge the nature of international marketing opportunities. BAV shows global brands must build consistently strong Brand Strength, Brand Stature, and power on key factors that drive brand pillars and meaning *in each market*.
