# How to Interpret Tracking Studies

To yield actionable insights and recommendations, tracking measures must be as reliable and sensitive as possible. One problem with many traditional measures of marketing phenomena is that they don’t change much over time. Although this stability may mean the data haven’t changed much, it may also be that one or more brand dimensions have changed to some extent but the measures themselves are not sensitive enough to detect subtle shifts. To develop sensitive tracking measures, marketers might need to phrase questions in a comparative way—“compared to other brands, how much . . .” or in terms of time periods—“compared to one month or one year ago, how much . . .”

Another challenge in interpreting tracking studies is deciding on appropriate benchmarks. For example, what is a sufficiently high level of brand awareness? When are brand associations sufficiently strong, favorable, and unique? How positive should brand judgments and feelings be? What are reasonable expectations for the amount of brand resonance? The cutoffs must not be unreasonable and must properly reflect the interests of the intended internal management audience. Appropriately defined and tested targets can help management benchmark against competitors and assess the productivity of brand marketing teams.

Marketers may also have to design these targets with allowance for competitive considerations and the nature of the category. In some low-involvement categories like, say, lightbulbs, it may be difficult to carve out a distinct image, unlike the case for higher-involvement products like cars or computers. Marketers must allow for and monitor the number of respondents who indicate they “don’t know” or have “no response” to the brand tracking measures: the more of these types of answers collected, the less consumers would seem to care.

One of the most important tasks in conducting brand tracking studies is to identify the determinants of brand equity.<sup>12</sup> Which brand associations actually influence consumer attitudes and behavior and create value for the brand? Marketers must identify the real value drivers for a brand—that is, those tangible and intangible points-of-difference that influence and determine consumers’ product and brand choices. Similarly, marketers must identify the marketing activities that have the most effective impact on brand knowledge, especially consumer exposure to advertising and other communication mix elements.

Carefully monitoring and relating key sources and outcome measures of brand equity should help to address these issues. The brand resonance and brand value chain models suggest many possible links and paths to explore for their impact on brand equity. (Chapters 9 and 10 discuss several measures in more detail.)

# ESTABLISHING A BRAND EQUITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Brand tracking studies, as well as brand audits, can provide a huge reservoir of information about how best to build and measure brand equity. To get the most value from these research efforts, firms need proper internal structures and procedures to capitalize on the usefulness of the brand equity concept and the information they collect about it. Although a brand equity measurement system does not ensure that managers will always make “good” decisions about the brand, it should increase the likelihood they do and, if nothing else, decrease the likelihood of “bad” decisions.

Embracing the concept of branding and brand equity, many firms constantly review how they can best factor it into the organization. Interestingly, perhaps one of the biggest threats to brand equity comes from *within* the organization, and the fact that too many marketing managers remain on the job for only a limited period of time. As a result of these short-term assignments, marketing managers may adopt a short-term perspective, leading to an overreliance on quick-fix sales-generating tactics such as line and category extensions, sales promotions, and so forth. Because these managers lack an understanding and appreciation of the brand equity concept, some critics maintain, they are essentially running the brand “without a license.”

To counteract these and other potential forces within an organization that may lead to ineffective long-term management of brands, many firms have made internal branding a top priority, as we noted in Chapter 2. As part of these efforts, they must put a brand equity management system into place. A **brand equity management system** is a set of organizational processes designed to improve the understanding and use of the brand equity concept within a firm. Three major steps help to implement a brand equity management system: creating brand charters, assembling brand equity reports, and defining brand equity responsibilities. The following subsections discuss each of these in turn. Branding Brief 8-2 describes how the Mayo Clinic has developed a brand equity measurement and management system.
