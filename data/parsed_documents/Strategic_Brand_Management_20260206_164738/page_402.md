BRANDING BRIEF 11-2

Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix, seemingly could
do no wrong. Founded in 1997, Netflix pioneered the DVD-by-
mail category, successfully challenging traditional video stores
and driving industry leader Blockbuster into bankruptcy in the
process. Netflix’s bold formula for success included flawless
service delivery combined with a state-of-the-art movie rec-
ommendation engine for users. The company even famously
sponsored a contest with a $1 million prize to anyone who

found on its corporate Web site: “Avoid ‘barnacles’ that can slow
down a fast-growing business” and “Make tough decisions with-

found a receptive audience ready to instantaneously download
and view video. That’s also where the trouble began.
