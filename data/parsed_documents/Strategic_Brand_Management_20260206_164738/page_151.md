## Sample Suggestive Brand Names

This data presents a list of distinct consumer product brands, each representing a specific product category. The brands are: ColorStay lipsticks, Head & Shoulders shampoo, Close-Up toothpaste, SnackWell reduced fat snacks, DieHard auto batteries, Mop & Glo floor wax, Lean Cuisine low-calorie frozen entrees, Shake’n Bake chicken seasoning, Sub-Zero refrigerators and freezers, and Cling-Free static buildup remover. The structure is a simple enumeration, with each entry highlighting a brand name and its associated product type, indicating a diverse range of market offerings across personal care, food, automotive, household, and appliance sectors. There is no explicit relationship or hierarchy depicted between these items; they are presented as individual examples of branded consumer goods.

Here too there are trade-offs. Even if a distinctive brand name is advantageous for brand recognition, it also has to be credible and desirable in the product category. A notable exception is Smuckers jelly, which has tried to turn the handicap of its distinctive—but potentially dislikable—name into a positive through its slogan, “With a Name Like Smucker’s, It Has to Be Good!”

**Brand Associations**  
Because the brand name is a compact form of communication, the explicit and implicit meanings consumers extract from it are important. In naming a new peer-to-peer communication technology, the founders landed on the descriptive “Sky peer-to-peer” which they decided to shorten to Skyper. When the corresponding Web address Skyper.com was not available, they shortened it again to the much more user-friendly Skype.<sup>17</sup>

The brand name can be chosen to reinforce an important attribute or benefit association that makes up its product positioning (see Figure 4-4). Besides performance-related considerations, brand names can also communicate more abstract considerations as do names like Joy dishwashing liquid, Caress soap, and Obsession perfume. Consider the reasoning behind the name of Colgate’s new mini toothbrush.

## COLGATE WISP

Famed brand-identity firm Lexicon has developed some wildly successful brand names, such as BlackBerry, Dasani, Febreze, OnStar, Pentium, Scion, and Swiffer. To develop a name for a new disposable mini toothbrush from Colgate, the firm went through a careful development process. The center of the disposable toothbrush held a dab of special toothpaste that made rinsing unnecessary and brushing on the go possible. Deciding to focus on the lightness, softness, and gentleness of the product, Lexicon’s global network of 70 linguists in 50 countries brainstormed metaphors and sounds that conveyed lightness. One name—Wisp—jumped out at company founder David Placek. Subsequent consumer research validated its positive connotations, and a new name was born.<sup>18</sup>
