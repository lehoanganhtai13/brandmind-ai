### Brand Consideration.  
Favorable brand attitudes and perceptions of credibility are important, but not important enough if customers don’t actually *consider* the brand for possible purchase or use. As Chapter 2 introduced, consideration depends in part on how personally relevant customers find the brand and is a crucial filter in terms of building brand equity. No matter how highly they regard the brand or how credible they find it, unless they also give it serious consideration and deem it relevant, customers will keep a brand at a distance and never closely embrace it. Brand consideration depends in large part on the extent to which strong and favorable brand associations can be created as part of the brand image.

### Brand Superiority.  
Superiority measures the extent to which customers view the brand as unique and better than other brands. Do customers believe it offers advantages that other brands cannot? Superiority is absolutely critical to building intense and active relationships with customers and depends to a great degree on the number and nature of unique brand associations that make up the brand image.

### Brand Feelings  
**Brand feelings** are customers’ emotional responses and reactions to the brand. Brand feelings also relate to the social currency evoked by the brand. What feelings are evoked by the marketing program for the brand or by other means? How does the brand affect customers’ feelings about themselves and their relationship with others? These feelings can be mild or intense and can be positive or negative.

For example, Kevin Roberts of Saatchi & Saatchi argues that companies must transcend brands to create “trustmarks”—a name or symbol that emotionally binds a company with the desires and aspirations of its customers—and ultimately “lovemarks.” He argues that it is not enough for a brand to be just respected.

> Pretty much everything today can be seen in relation to a love-respect axis. You can plot any relationship—with a person, with a brand—by whether it’s based on love or based on respect. It used to be that a high respect rating would win. But these days, a high love rating wins. If I don’t love what you’re offering me, I’m not even interested.<sup>24</sup>

A passionate believer in the concept, Roberts reinforces the point that trustmarks truly belong to the people who offer the love to the brand, and that an emotional connection is critical.<sup>25</sup>

The emotions evoked by a brand can become so strongly associated that they are accessible during product consumption or use. Researchers have defined *transformational advertising* as advertising designed to change consumers’ perceptions of the actual usage experience with the product.[26] Corona Extra overtook Heineken as the leading imported beer in the United States via its “beach in a bottle” advertising.
