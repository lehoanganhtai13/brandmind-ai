**Consumer Factors.** To evaluate the potential of a proposed brand extension, we assess its ability to achieve its own brand equity, as well as the likelihood that it can affect the parent brand’s existing brand equity. First, marketers must forecast the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of *all* associations to the brand extension. In other words, what will be the salience, favorability, or uniqueness of parent brand associations in the proposed extension context? Similarly, what will be the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of any other inferred associations? The three-factor model of extension evaluations and the four-factor model of extension feedback effects can provide guidance in studying consumer reactions.

To narrow down the list of possible extensions, we often need consumer research (see Chapter 10 for a review). We can ask consumers directly for their brand permission (“How well does the proposed extension fit with the parent brand?” or “Would you expect such a new product from the parent brand?”). We can even ask what products they believe are currently attached to the brand: If a majority of consumers believe a proposed extension product is already being sold under the brand, there would seem to be little risk in introducing it, at least based on initial consumer reaction.

To understand consumers’ perceptions of a proposed extension, we can use open-ended associations (“What comes into your mind when you think of the brand extension?” or “What are your first impressions on hearing that the parent brand is introducing the extension?”), as well as ratings scales based on reactions to concept statements. An interesting new statistical approach uses Bayesian factor analysis to separate brand and category effects to better assess brand fit.<sup>47</sup> Common pitfalls include failing to take all consumers’ brand knowledge structures into account. Often marketers mistakenly focus on one or perhaps a few brand associations as a potential basis of fit and ignore other, possibly more important, brand associations in the process.

### BIC

By emphasizing inexpensive, disposable products, the French company Société Bic was able to create markets for nonrefillable ballpoint pens in the late 1950s, disposable cigarette lighters in the early 1970s, and disposable razors in the early 1980s. It unsuccessfully tried the same strategy in marketing Bic perfumes in the United States and Europe in 1989. The perfumes—two for women (“Nuit” and “Jour”) and two for men (“Bic for Men” and “Bic Sport for Men”)—were packaged in quarter-ounce glass spray bottles that looked like fat cigarette lighters and sold for $5 each. The products were displayed on racks in plastic packages at checkout counters throughout Bic’s extensive distribution channels, which included 100,000 or so drugstores, supermarkets, and other mass merchandisers. At the time, a Bic spokeswoman described the new products as extensions of the Bic heritage—“high quality at affordable prices, convenient to purchase, and convenient to use.”<sup>48</sup> The brand extension was launched with a $20 million advertising and promotion campaign containing images of stylish people enjoying themselves with the perfume and using the tag line “Paris in Your Pocket.” Nevertheless, Bic was unable to overcome its lack of cachet and negative image associations; failing to achieve a critical point-of-parity, the extension fell short.

Another major mistake in evaluating brand extensions is overlooking how literal consumers can be in evaluating brand extensions. Although consumers ultimately care about benefits, they often notice and evaluate attributes—especially concrete ones—in reacting to an extension. Brand managers, though, tend to focus on perceived benefits in predicting consumer reactions, and, as a result, they may overlook some potentially damaging attribute associations.
