These expenditure levels were run for one year and revealed that the “no advertising” level resulted in the same amount of sales as the current program. In fact, the 50 percent cut in advertising expenditures actually resulted in an increase in sales, consistent with the notion that strong brands such as Budweiser do not require the same advertising levels, at least over a short period of time, as a less well-known or well-liked brand.<sup>85</sup>  
Similarly, because of existing brand knowledge structures, consumers may be more likely to notice sales promotions, direct mail offerings, or other sales-oriented marketing communications and respond favorably. For example, several studies have shown that promotion effectiveness is asymmetric in favor of a higher-quality brand.<sup>86</sup>  

### Possible Licensing and Brand Extension Opportunities

A strong brand often has associations that may be desirable in other product categories. To capitalize on this value, as discussed in Chapter 7, a firm may choose to license its name, logo, or other trademark item to another company for use on its products and merchandise. The rationale for the licensee (the company obtaining the rights to use the trademark) is that consumers will pay more for a product because of the recognition and image lent by the trademark. One marketing research study showed that consumers would pay $60 for cookware licensed under the Julia Child name as opposed to only $40 for identical cookware bearing the Sears name.<sup>87</sup>  
As will be outlined in Chapter 11, a *brand extension* occurs when a firm uses an established brand name to enter a new market. A *line extension* uses a current brand name to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, say with new varieties, new flavors, or new sizes.  
Academic research has shown that well-known and well-regarded brands can extend more successfully and into more diverse categories than other brands.<sup>88</sup>  In addition, the amount of brand equity has been shown to be correlated with the highest- or lowest-quality member in the product line for vertical product extensions.<sup>89</sup>  Research has also shown that positive symbolic associations may be the basis of these evaluations, even if overall brand attitude itself is not necessarily high.<sup>90</sup>  
Brands with varied product category associations through past extensions have been shown to be especially extendable.<sup>91</sup>  As a result, introductory marketing programs for extensions from an established brand may be more efficient than others.<sup>92</sup>  
Several studies have indicated that extension activity has aided (or at least did not dilute) brand equity for the parent brand. For instance, brand extensions strengthened parent brand associations, and “flagship brands” were highly resistant to dilution or other potential negative effects caused by negative experiences with an extension.<sup>93</sup>  Research has also found evidence of an ownership effect, whereby current owners generally had more favorable responses to brand line extensions.<sup>94</sup>  Finally, extensions of brands that have both high familiarity and positive attitudes have been shown to receive higher initial stock market reactions than other brands.<sup>95</sup>  

### Other Benefits

Brands with positive customer-based brand equity may provide other advantages to the firm not directly related to the products themselves, such as helping the firm to attract or motivate better employees, generate greater interest from investors, and garner more support from shareholders.<sup>96</sup>  In terms of the latter, several research studies have shown that brand equity can be directly related to corporate stock price.<sup>97</sup>
