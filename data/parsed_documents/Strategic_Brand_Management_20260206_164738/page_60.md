This table outlines a four-step process for managing brand equity. The initial step, "Identify and Establish Brand Positioning and Values," involves defining the competitive frame of reference, points-of-parity and difference, core brand associations, and brand mantra, often informed by mental maps. The second step, "Plan and Implement Brand Marketing Programs," focuses on the strategic mixing and matching of brand elements, integrating marketing activities, and leveraging secondary associations. Following this, "Measure and Interpret Brand Performance" utilizes tools such as the brand value chain, brand audits, brand tracking, and a brand equity management system. The final step, "Grow and Sustain Brand Equity," encompasses establishing brand architecture, managing brand portfolios and hierarchies, implementing brand expansion strategies, and employing brand reinforcement and revitalization techniques. This structured approach moves from foundational positioning to ongoing growth and maintenance of brand equity.

2. The marketing activities and supporting marketing programs and the way the brand is integrated into them; and  
3. Other associations indirectly transferred to or leveraged by the brand as a result of linking it to some other entity (such as the company, country of origin, channel of distribution, or another brand).

Some important considerations of each of these three factors are as follows.

**Choosing Brand Elements.**  
The most common brand elements are brand names, URLs, logos, symbols, characters, packaging, and slogans. The best test of the brand-building contribution of a brand element is what consumers would think about the product or service if they knew only its brand name or its associated logo or other element. Because different elements have different advantages, marketing managers often use a subset of all the possible brand elements or even all of them. Chapter 4 examines in detail the means by which the choice and design of brand elements can help to build brand equity.

**Integrating the Brand into Marketing Activities and the Supporting Marketing Program.**  
Although the judicious choice of brand elements can make some contribution to building brand equity, the biggest contribution comes from marketing activities related to the brand. This text highlights only some particularly important marketing program considerations for building brand equity. Chapter 5 addresses new developments in designing marketing programs as well as issues in product strategy, pricing strategy, and channels strategy. Chapter 6 addresses issues in communications strategy.

**Leveraging Secondary Associations.**  
The third and final way to build brand equity is to leverage secondary associations. Brand associations may themselves be linked to other entities that have their own associations, creating these secondary associations. For example, the brand may be linked to certain source factors, such as the company (through branding strategies), countries or other geographical regions (through identification of product origin), and channels of distribution (through channel strategy), as well as to other brands (through ingredients or co-branding), characters (through licensing), spokespeople (through endorsements), sporting or cultural events (through sponsorship), or some other third-party sources (through awards or reviews).

Because the brand becomes identified with another entity, even though this entity may not directly relate to the product or service performance, consumers may *infer* that the brand shares associations with that entity, thus producing indirect or secondary associations for the brand.
