1. *Awareness and knowledge of the entity:* If consumers have no awareness or knowledge of the secondary entity, then obviously there is nothing they can transfer from it. Ideally, consumers would be aware of the entity; hold some strong, favorable, and perhaps even unique associations about it; and have positive judgments and feelings about it.

2. *Meaningfulness of the knowledge of the entity:* Given that the entity evokes some positive associations, judgments, or feelings, is this knowledge relevant and meaningful for the brand? The meaningfulness may vary depending on the brand and product context. Some associations, judgments, or feelings may seem relevant to and valuable for the brand, whereas others may seem to consumers to have little connection.

3. *Transferability of the knowledge of the entity:* Assuming that some potentially useful and meaningful associations, judgments, or feelings exist regarding the entity and could possibly transfer to the brand, how strongly will this knowledge actually become linked to the brand?

In other words, the basic questions we want to answer about transferring secondary knowledge from another entity are: What do consumers know about the other entity? and, Does any of this knowledge affect what they think about the brand when it becomes linked or associated in some fashion with this other entity?

Theoretically, consumers can infer any aspect of knowledge from other entities to the brand (see Figure 7-2), although some types of entities are more likely to inherently create or affect certain kinds of brand knowledge than others. For example, events may be especially conducive to the creation of experiences; people may be especially effective for the elicitation of feelings; other brands may be especially well suited for establishing particular attributes and benefits; and so on. At the same time, any one entity may be associated with multiple dimensions of knowledge, each of which may affect brand knowledge directly or indirectly.

For example, consider the effects on knowledge of linking the brand to a cause, like Avon’s Breast Cancer Crusade. A cause marketing program could build brand awareness via recall and recognition; enhance brand image in terms of attributes such as brand personality or user imagery like kind and generous; evoke brand feelings like social approval and self-respect; establish brand attitudes such as trustworthy and likable; and create experiences through a sense of community and participation in cause-related activities.

Judgments or feelings may transfer more readily than more specific associations, which are likely to seem irrelevant or be too strongly linked to the original entity to transfer. As we’ll see in Chapter 12, the inferencing process depends largely on the strength of the linkage or connection in consumers’ minds between the brand and the other entity. The more consumers see similarity between the entity and the brand, the more likely they will infer similar knowledge about the brand.

### Guidelines

Leveraging secondary brand associations may allow marketers to create or reinforce an important point-of-difference or a necessary or competitive point-of-parity versus competitors. When choosing to emphasize source factors or a particular person, place, or thing, marketers

This table illustrates a comparative structure, contrasting elements related to "Brand" on the left with those of an "Other Entity" on the right, with "TRANSFER" as a central, unifying concept. Both sides are analyzed across three categories: Awareness, Attributes, and Benefits. Within Awareness, specific components include Images, Attitudes, and a general "Brand" or "Other Entity" designation. Attributes encompass Thoughts and Experiences. Benefits are represented by Feelings. The table suggests a parallel examination of how awareness, attributes, and benefits are perceived or constructed for a brand versus an alternative entity, with the concept of "TRANSFER" implying a potential movement or comparison of these elements between the two.

**FIGURE 7-2**  
*Understanding Transfer of Brand Knowledge* should take into account consumers’ awareness of that entity, as well as how the associations, judgments, or feelings for it might become linked to the brand or affect existing brand associations.
