# Developing a Brand Strategy

3. **Excitement:** The brand makes consumers feel energized and that they are experiencing something special. Brands that evoke excitement may generate a sense of elation, of “being alive,” or being cool, sexy, etc. MTV is a brand seen by many teens and young adults as exciting.

4. **Security:** The brand produces a feeling of safety, comfort, and self-assurance. As a result of the brand, consumers do not experience worry or concerns that they might have otherwise felt. Allstate Insurance and its “Good Hands” symbol and State Farm and its “Like a Good Neighbor” slogan are brands that communicate security to many.

5. **Social approval:** The brand gives consumers a belief that others look favorably on their appearance, behavior, and so on. This approval may be a result of direct acknowledgment of the consumer’s use of the brand by others or may be less overt and a result of attribution of product use to consumers. To an older generation of consumers, Cadillac is a brand that historically has been a signal of social approval.

6. **Self-respect:** The brand makes consumers feel better about themselves; consumers feel a sense of pride, accomplishment, or fulfillment. A brand like Tide laundry detergent is able to link its brand to “doing the best things for the family” to many homemakers.

These six feelings can be divided into two broad categories: The first three types of feelings are experiential and immediate, increasing in level of intensity; the latter three types of feelings are private and enduring, increasing in level of gravity.

**Summary.** Although all types of customer responses are possible—driven from both the head and heart—ultimately what matters is how positive they are. Responses must also be accessible and come to mind when consumers think of the brand. Brand judgments and feelings can favorably affect consumer behavior only if consumers internalize or think of positive responses in their various encounters with the brand.

## Brand Resonance

The final step of the model focuses on the ultimate relationship and level of identification that the customer has with the brand.<sup>30</sup> *Brand resonance* describes the nature of this relationship and the extent to which customers feel that they are “in sync” with the brand. Examples of brands with historically high resonance include Harley-Davidson, Apple, and eBay.

Resonance is characterized in terms of *intensity*, or the depth of the psychological bond that customers have with the brand, as well as the level of *activity* engendered by this loyalty (repeat purchase rates and the extent to which customers seek out brand information, events, and other loyal customers). We can break down these two dimensions of brand resonance into four categories:

1. Behavioral loyalty  
2. Attitudinal attachment  
3. Sense of community  
4. Active engagement  

### Behavioral Loyalty

We can gauge *behavioral loyalty* in terms of repeat purchases and the amount or share of category volume attributed to the brand, that is, the “share of category requirements.” In other words, how often do customers purchase a brand and how much do they purchase? For bottom-line profit results, the brand must generate sufficient purchase frequencies and volumes.

The lifetime value of behaviorally loyal consumers can be enormous.<sup>31</sup> For example, a loyal General Motors customer could be worth $276,000 over his or her lifetime (assuming 11 or more vehicles bought and word-of-mouth endorsement that makes friends and relatives more likely to consider GM products). Or consider new parents. By spending $100 a month on diapers and wipes for 24–30 months, they can create lifetime value of as much as $3,000 for just one baby.

### Attitudinal Attachment

Behavioral loyalty is necessary but not sufficient for resonance to occur.<sup>32</sup> Some customers may buy out of necessity—because the brand is the only product stocked or readily accessible, the only one they can afford, or other reasons. Resonance, however, requires a strong personal *attachment*. Customers should go beyond having a positive attitude to viewing the brand as something special in a broader context. For example, customers with a great deal of attitudinal attachment to a brand may state that they “love” the brand, describe it as one of their favorite possessions, or view it as a “little pleasure” that they look forward to.
