## Vertical Brand Extensions

We’ve seen that brand extensions can expand market coverage and bring new consumers into the brand franchise. Vertical brand extensions, which extend the brand up into more premium market segments or down into more value-conscious segments, are a common means of attracting new groups of consumers. The central logic here is that the equity of the parent brand can be transferred in either direction to appeal to consumers who otherwise would not consider it.

**Pros and Cons.** Vertical extensions can confer a number of advantages. An upward extension can improve brand image, because a premium version of a brand often brings positive associations with it. Extensions in either direction can offer consumers variety, revitalize the parent brand, and permit further extensions in a given direction.

Yet vertical extensions are also susceptible to many of the disadvantages of brand extensions. A vertical extension to a new price point, whether higher or lower, can confuse or frustrate consumers who have learned to expect a certain price range from a brand. Consumers may reject the extension and the parent brand’s image will suffer. For prestige brands in particular, firms must often maintain a balance between availability and scarcity such that people always aspire to be a customer and do not feel excluded.

Even a successful downward extension has the possibility of harming the parent’s brand image by introducing associations common to lower-priced brands, such as inferior quality or reduced service. Interestingly, however, research has shown that higher-quality extensions are likely to improve evaluations of the parent brand more than lower-quality extensions might harm it.<sup>40</sup>

One of the biggest risk factors of a vertical extension, particularly a downward one, is that it will succeed but cannibalize sales of a parent brand. It may bring new consumers to the brand franchise, but it may also bring a greater number of existing customers of the parent brand.

For example, when it held 70 percent global market share with its Kodak Gold brand, Kodak launched the discount Kodak Funtime brand to compete with the threat of lower-priced Fuji film. Cannibalization of the Kodak Gold brand soon followed, and Kodak found itself in a price war with Fuji that ultimately led to a significant decline in Kodak Gold market share. While the parent brand name “gives you the credibility to quickly gain share in the lower-end market,” cannibalization is a likely outcome because “if you’ve already persuaded people that only the best products are sold under your brand, then they’ll readily buy the least expensive item with that brand name.”<sup>41</sup> **Examples.** Despite the problems inherent in vertical extensions, many companies have succeeded in extending their brands to enter new markets across a range of price points.
