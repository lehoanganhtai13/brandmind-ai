# BRANDING BRIEF 13-1

## Razor-Sharp Branding at Gillette

blade and razor market and even more in Europe and Latin America. In fact, more than 70 percent of Gillette’s sales and profits come from overseas operations in 200 countries. Moreover, its 10 percent profit margin is substantially higher than for other brands found at most packaged-goods companies. How has Gillette been so successful for so long? The marketing and branding practices that have supported the brand through the years provide a number of useful lessons.

Fundamentally, Gillette continually innovates to produce a demonstrably superior product. Gillette’s credo is to “increase spending in ‘growth drivers’—R&D, plant and equipment, and advertising—at least as fast as revenues go up.” As Gillette’s former CEO Alfred Zeien proclaimed, “Good products come out of market research. Great products come from R&D.” Gillette typically spends more than 2 percent of its annual sales on R&D, double the average at many consumer products companies.

Gillette also backs its products with strong advertising and promotional support. TV ads have used champion athletes such as Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Thierry Henry, Derek Jeter, and others with the now-familiar tag line, “The Best a Man Can Get.” Skillful marketing thus creates both strong performance and imagery associations. Figure 13-2 summarizes Gillette’s product innovations during the last 30 years. Here we highlight a few of the key developments over the last decade or so.

When it launched the Mach3 in 1998, Gillette considered it to be the most important new product in its history and invested more than $750 million in research and development and manufacturing expenses, securing 35 patents in the process. The major advancement of the Mach3 was the triple blade, each part of which was designed to shave progressively closer. The product was highly anticipated and generated more than 500 million media impressions before the advertising campaign began. During the launch year, Gillette set a marketing budget of $300 million globally and $100 million in the United States. The Mach3, which cost 35 percent more than the Sensor Excel, captured a stunning 35 percent of the razor market within two weeks of its launch date and surpassed the $1 billion sales mark only 15 months after its debut.

As successful as Mach3 was, Gillette’s women’s version of the product was perhaps an even more impressive achievement. Gillette spent $300 million on research and development for Venus, its first razor designed solely for women. Based on extensive consumer research and market testing, Venus was a marked departure from previous women’s razor designs, which had essentially been colored or repackaged versions of men’s razors. After research revealed that women change their grip on a razor about 30 times during each shaving session, Gillette designed the Venus with a wide, sculpted rubberized handle offering superior grip and control, and an oval-shaped blade in a storage case that could stick to shower walls. Research also indicated that women were reluctant to leave the shower in order to replace a dull blade, so the case was made to hold spare blade cartridges. Gillette spent $150 million on marketing for the highly successful worldwide Venus launch.

In 2004, it upgraded the Mach3 by introducing the M3 Power, the first disposable razor to feature a battery-powered vibration option, which allowed for a closer shave. A Venus version, called Venus Vibrance, soon followed. In its next major launch in 2006, Gillette introduced the six-bladed Fusion and

The Gillette Razor Brand History table outlines a chronological progression of product innovations from 1971 to 2009. The history begins with the introduction of the Trac II, the first twin-blade razor, followed by the disposable Good News razor in 1973. Subsequent developments focused on enhancing the twin-blade design, introducing features like a pivoting head with the Atra (1977), a lubricant strip with Atra Plus (1984), and individually mounted blades with Sensor (1988). The timeline then shows a specific adaptation for women with Sensor for Women (1991) and further refinement with microfins in Sensor Excel (1993). A significant shift occurred in 1997 with the Mach3, the first triple-blade razor, which was later enhanced in 1999 as Mach3 Turbo. The introduction of battery-powered vibration marked the M3 Power in 2002. The evolution continued with the development of a five-blade razor, the Fusion (2006), and culminated in the Fusion ProGlide (2009) with re-engineered, low-resistance blades. Associations may be easier to change, for example, through a major new advertising campaign that communicates a different type of user or usage situation.
