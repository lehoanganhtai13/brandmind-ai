Each successive branding level allows the firm to communicate additional, specific information about its products. Thus, developing brands at lower levels of the hierarchy allows the firm flexibility in communicating the uniqueness of its products. At the same time, developing brands at higher levels of the hierarchy is obviously an economical means of communicating common or shared information and providing synergy across the company’s operations, both internally and externally.

As we noted above, the practice of combining an existing brand with a new brand is called sub-branding, because the subordinate brand is a means of modifying the superordinate brand. A sub-brand, or hybrid branding, strategy can also allow for the creation of specific brand beliefs. Prada has successfully launched several distinct sub-brands, which all offer excellent design and high quality.

## PRADA

Miuccia Prada is one of the most highly rated fashion designers worldwide. Prada launched a groundbreaking black nylon handbag with a distinct Prada logo in the early 1990s, which remains one of the most iconic and desirable handbags to date. Prada is renowned for its innovative use of textiles, classic cuts that last beyond a season, demure ladylike styles, and high-quality finish. It has consistently invested in marketing.

Miu Miu, also referred to as Prada’s “little sister,” provides an entry point into the Prada brand and has consistently enjoyed strong financial results and a positive consumer reaction. Miu Miu was launched to enable Miuccia Prada to continue to experiment with and communicate her design passions, which she has had to subdue with Prada following its huge commercial success. Consumers like Miu Miu for its provocative and sensual avant-garde style.

Prada consistently performs despite economic downturns. Prada was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2011 and now plans to double its stores worldwide in three years, with a focus on China. The company has continued to extend its product range since its inception. It penetrated the eyewear and fragrances markets in 2000 and launched a mobile phone in 2006. Prada and Miu Miu branded sunglasses are produced under a license agreement by Luxottica Group (LG). Prada perfumes are produced by the Puig Group. Prada Group has sold well over 1 million Prada phones in partnership with LG.

Prada has successfully developed its Miu Miu sub-brand by keeping its appeal and positioning distinct from the parent Prada label. All Prada products are clearly labeled with the coveted Miu Miu or Prada logo.[19]
