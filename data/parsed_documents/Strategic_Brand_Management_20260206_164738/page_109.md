# Brand Resonance Pyramid and Subdimensions of Brand Building Blocks

The provided table outlines the stages of brand development, illustrating a hierarchical structure leading to brand resonance. The foundational stage is Salience, establishing brand identity and awareness. Building upon this, consumers form Judgments about brand performance and Feelings associated with the brand. These Judgments and Feelings, in turn, contribute to the development of brand Relationships, characterized by the question "What about you and me?". The ultimate objective at this highest stage is Resonance, signifying a deep, loyal connection between the consumer and the brand. This progression moves from basic awareness to a profound, interactive relationship.

This table outlines the subdimensions of Brand Building Blocks, structured hierarchically with "Resonance" and "Salience" as overarching categories. Resonance encompasses "Loyalty," "Attachment," "Community," and "Engagement," representing the deepest level of brand connection. Below Resonance, two key dimensions are presented: "Judgments," which includes "Quality," "Credibility," "Consideration," and "Superiority," and "Feelings," comprising "Warmth," "Fun," "Excitement," "Security," "Social Approval," and "Self-Respect." Further down, "Performance" details aspects like "Primary Characteristics and Secondary Features," "Reliability," "Durability," "Serviceability," "Service Effectiveness," "Efficiency," "Empathy," "Style and Design," and "Price." Similarly, "Imagery" covers "User Profiles," "Purchase and Usage Situations," "Personality and Values," and "History, Heritage, and Experiences." Finally, Salience, at the base, is defined by "Category Identification" and "Needs Satisfied," indicating the brand's accessibility and relevance.

>  
> We’ve said that brand awareness refers to customers’ ability to recall and recognize the brand under different conditions and to link the brand name, logo, symbol, and so forth to certain associations in memory. In particular, building brand awareness helps customers understand the product or service category in which the brand competes and what products or services are sold under the brand name. It also ensures that customers know which of their “needs” the brand—through these products—is designed to satisfy. In other words, what basic functions does the brand provide to customers?  
>  
> **Breadth and Depth of Awareness.** Brand awareness thus gives the product an identity by linking brand elements to a product category and associated purchase and consumption or usage situations. The *depth* of brand awareness measures how likely it is for a brand element to come to mind, and the ease with which it does so. A brand we easily recall has a deeper level of brand awareness than one that we recognize only when we see it. The *breadth* of brand awareness measures the range of purchase and usage situations in which the brand element comes to mind and depends to a large extent on the organization of brand and product knowledge in memory.<sup>1</sup> To see how this works, consider the breadth and depth of brand awareness for Tropicana orange juice.
