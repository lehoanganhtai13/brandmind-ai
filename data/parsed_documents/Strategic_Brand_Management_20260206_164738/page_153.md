This table outlines various linguistic devices used in product naming, categorized into Phonetic, Orthographic, Morphologic, and Semantic devices. Phonetic devices involve sound repetition and alteration, including alliteration, assonance, consonance, and different types of rhyme, as well as onomatopoeia and sound-based name modifications like clipping and blending, exemplified by Coca-Cola, Kal Kan, Weight Watchers, Max Pax, American Airlines, Black & Decker, Wisk, Chevy, Aspergum, and Duracell. Orthographic devices utilize unusual spellings, abbreviations, and acronyms, seen in Kool-Aid, 7 UP, and Amoco. Morphologic devices employ affixation and compounding, as in Jell-O and Janitor-in-a-Drum. Semantic devices leverage meaning and figurative language, such as metaphor (Arrid, AquaFresh), metonymy (Midas), synecdoche (Red Lobster), personification (Betty Crocker), oxymoron (Easy-Off), paranomasia (Hawaiian Punch), and semantic appositeness (Bufferin), to create evocative and memorable brand names.

A number of different procedures or systems have been suggested for naming new products. Most adopt a procedure something along the following lines. Figure 4-6 displays some common naming mistakes according to leading marketing and branding consultancy Lippincott.<sup>33</sup>

1. **Define objectives.** First, define the branding objectives in terms of the six general criteria we noted earlier, and in particular define the ideal meaning the brand should convey. Recognize the role of the brand within the corporate branding hierarchy and how it should relate to other brands and products (we’ll discuss this in Chapter 11). In many cases, existing brand names may serve, at least in part. Finally, understand the role of the brand within the entire marketing program and the target market.
