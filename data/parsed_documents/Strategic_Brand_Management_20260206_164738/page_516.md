Figure 14-1 outlines the advantages of global marketing programs, presenting a set of benefits that accrue from a unified international marketing strategy. These advantages include achieving economies of scale in both production and distribution processes, which can lead to cost reductions. Furthermore, global marketing programs contribute to lower overall marketing costs and enhance a company's power and scope in the international arena. A key outcome is the maintenance of a consistent brand image across different markets, alongside the ability to leverage successful ideas rapidly and efficiently. Finally, the approach promotes uniformity in marketing practices, streamlining operations and reinforcing brand presence worldwide.

## Lower Marketing Costs  
Another set of cost advantages arises from uniformity in packaging, advertising, promotion, and other marketing communication activities. The more uniform, the greater the potential savings. A global corporate branding strategy such as Sony’s is perhaps the most efficient means of spreading marketing costs across both products and countries. Branding experts maintain that using one name can save a business tens of millions of dollars a year in marketing costs.[^13]

As Chapter 13 noted, L’Oréal has pursued an aggressive global growth strategy, prompting one business writer to christen the company “the United Nations of beauty.” Its Maybelline line is the best-selling brand in many Asian markets, while eastern Europeans prefer L’Oréal’s French brands, and African immigrants in Europe go for the U.S. brand Dark and Lovely. L’Oréal ensures its business remains sound on a local level by establishing national divisions. Because Brazilian women traditionally bought their cosmetics from door-to-door sales reps, the company introduced personal beauty advisers at department stores there. As the one-time head of L’Oréal’s head of luxury products said, “You have to be local and as strong as the best locals but backed by an international image and strategy.”[^14]

## Power and Scope  
A global brand profile can communicate credibility.[^15] Consumers may believe that selling in many diverse markets is an indication that a manufacturer has gained much expertise and acceptance, meaning the product is high quality and convenient to use. An admired global brand can also signal social status and prestige.[^16] Avis assures its customers that they can receive the same high-quality car rental service anywhere in the world, further reinforcing a key benefit promise embodied in its slogan, “We Try Harder.”

## Consistency in Brand Image  
Maintaining a common marketing platform all over the world helps maintain the consistency of brand and company image; this is particularly important where customers move often or media exposure transmits images across national boundaries. Gillette sells “functional superiority” and “an appreciation of human character and aspirations” with its razors and blades brands worldwide. Services often desire to convey a uniform image due to consumer movements. For example, American Express communicates the prestige and utility of its card worldwide.

## Ability to Leverage Good Ideas Quickly and Efficiently  
One global marketer notes that globalization can increase sustainability and “facilitate continued development of core competencies with the organization . . . in manufacturing, in R&D, in marketing and sales, and in less talked about areas such as competitive intelligence . . . all of which enhance the company’s ability to compete.”[^17] Not having to develop strictly local versions speeds a brand’s market entry. Marketers can leverage good ideas across markets as long as the right knowledge transfer systems are put into place. IBM has a Web-based communications tool that provides instant multimedia interaction to connect marketers. MasterCard’s corporate marketing group helps facilitate information and best practices across the organization.[^18]

## Uniformity of Marketing Practices  
Finally, a standardized global marketing program may simplify coordination and provide greater control of communications in different countries. By keeping the core of the marketing program constant, marketers can pay greater attention to making refinements across markets and over time to improve its effectiveness. Chapter 3 described the rationale for the MasterCard “Priceless” campaign. Here is how it became a global blockbuster.
