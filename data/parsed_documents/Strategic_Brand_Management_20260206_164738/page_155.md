## Select the final name

Some segment of consumers or another will always have at least some potentially negative associations with a new brand name. In most cases, however, assuming they are not severe, these associations will disappear after the initial marketing launch. Some consumers will dislike a new brand name because it’s unfamiliar or represents a deviation from the norm. Marketers should remember to separate these temporal considerations from more enduring effects. Here is how a new airline arrived at its name.³⁵

### SCOOT

In a bid to tap the growing demand for low-cost, no-frills air travel over long distance, Singapore Airlines (SIA) has launched a new budget carrier called Scoot. This new carrier began operations in June 2012 and has plans to fly to selected cities in Australia and China.

Right from the start, the airline’s intention is to adopt an upbeat, fun, and quirky approach to its branding. After going through a pitch with a number of advertising agencies, the airline appointed local ad agencies Sparkfury and Tangoshark to capture the essence of the brand. According to CEO Campbell Wilson, the unusual name “Scoot” was chosen because it was short, snappy, and stands out. He added that the new airline will have “Scootitude”—a different attitude which will guide the way in which they interact with their customers and each other, how their product, systems, and processes are designed, and how they differentiate themselves from their competitors. In line with the brand name, the bright yellow logo conveys warmth, energy, and informality, with the “t” tilted to give a nonconformist twist. The aircraft also come with waves of yellow color to give a sense of motion and youthfulness, while the cabin crew wear matching yellow tops.³⁶
