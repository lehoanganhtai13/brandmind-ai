Creating a positive brand image takes marketing programs that link strong, favorable, and unique associations to the brand in memory. Brand associations may be either brand attributes or benefits. *Brand attributes* are those descriptive features that characterize a product or service. *Brand benefits* are the personal value and meaning that consumers attach to the product or service attributes.

Consumers form beliefs about brand attributes and benefits in different ways. The definition of customer-based brand equity, however, does not distinguish between the source of brand associations and the manner in which they are formed; all that matters is their strength, favorability, and uniqueness. This means that consumers can form brand associations in a variety of ways other than marketing activities: from direct experience; online surfing; through information from other commercial or nonpartisan sources such as *Consumer Reports* or other media vehicles; from word of mouth; and by assumptions or inferences consumers make about the brand itself, its name, logo, or identification with a company, country, channel of distribution, or person, place, or event.

Marketers should recognize the influence of these other sources of information by both managing them as well as possible and by adequately accounting for them in designing communication strategies. Consider how The Body Shop originally built its brand equity.

### THE BODY SHOP

The Body Shop successfully created a global brand image without using conventional advertising. Its strong associations to personal care and environmental concern occurred through its products (natural ingredients only, never tested on animals), packaging (simple, refillable, recyclable), merchandising (detailed point-of-sale posters, brochures, and displays), staff (encouraged to be enthusiastic and informative concerning environmental issues), sourcing policies (using small local producers from around the world), social action program (requiring each franchisee to run a local community program), and public relations programs and activities (taking visible and sometimes outspoken stands on various issues).<sup>21</sup>

In short, to create the differential response that leads to customer-based brand equity, marketers need to make sure that some strongly held brand associations are not only favorable but also unique and not shared with competing brands. Unique associations help consumers choose the brand. To choose which favorable and unique associations to strongly link to the brand, marketers carefully analyze the consumer and the competition to determine the best positioning for the brand. Let’s consider some factors that, in general, affect the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations.
