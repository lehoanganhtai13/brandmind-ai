## Private-Label Strategies and Responses

This appendix considers the issue of private labels or store brands. After portraying private-label branding strategies, it describes how major manufacturers’ brands have responded to their threat.

### Private Labels

Although different terms and definitions are possible, *private labels* can be defined as products marketed by retailers and other members of the distribution chain. Private labels can be called *store brands* when they actually adopt the name of the store itself in some way (such as Safeway Select). Private labels should not be confused with **generics**, whose simple black-and-white packaging typically provides no information about who made the product.

Private-label brands typically cost less to make and sell than the national or manufacturer brands with which they compete. Thus, the appeal to consumers of buying private labels and store brands often is the cost savings involved; the appeal to retailers of selling private labels and store brands is that their gross margin is often 25 percent to 30 percent—nearly twice that of national brands.

The history of private labels is one of many ups and downs. The first private-label grocery products in the United States were sold by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (later known as A&P), which was founded in 1863. During the first half of the twentieth century, a number of store brands were successfully introduced. Under competitive pressure from the sophisticated mass-marketing practices adopted by large packaged-goods companies in the 1950s, private labels fell out of favor with consumers.

Because the appeal of private labels to consumers has traditionally been their lower cost, the sales of private labels generally have been highly correlated with personal disposable income. The recession of the 1970s saw the successful introduction of low-cost, basic-quality, and minimally packaged generic products that appealed to bargain-seeking consumers. During the subsequent economic upswing, though, the lack of perceived quality eventually hampered sales of generics, and many consumers returned to national or manufacturers’ brands.

To better compete in today’s marketplace, private-label makers have begun improving quality and expanding the variety of their private-label offerings to include premium products. In recognition of the power of bold graphics, supermarket retailers have been careful to design attractive, upscale packages for their own premium branded products. Because of these and other actions, private-label sales have recently made some major inroads in new markets. Retailers value private labels for their profit margins and their means of differentiation to drive customer loyalty. Retailer Target has introduced a steady stream of exclusives through the years, such as its stylish Mossimo apparel and Michael Graves houseware brands.⁹⁵

### Private-Label Status

The major recession that began in 2008 heightened interest once again in private labels. Given retailers’ success in improving private-label quality and developing cohesive branding and marketing programs, many critics wondered whether this time things would be different and sales would not drop after the end of the recession.⁹⁶

In the United States, private-label goods have accounted for roughly 16–17 percent of total supermarket dollar volume. In other countries, these percentages are often quite higher, on average twice as much. For example, Western Europe dominates the market for private labels in the supermarket, with the biggest being Switzerland at 45 percent, Germany at 30 percent, Spain at 26 percent, and Belgium at 25 percent.⁹⁷

Private labels in the United Kingdom make up over a third of sales at grocery stores, in part because the grocery industry is more concentrated. Two of the largest UK grocery chains are Tesco and Sainsbury.⁹⁸

* Tesco, with the brand slogan “Every Little Helps,” has a number of its own private-label brands, ranging from Value to Finest, and has its own lifestyle brands, such as Organic, Free Form, and Healthy Living, positioned as “Making Life Taste Better.”
* Sainsbury’s originally used its name to introduce a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, grocery, and household products, later expanding to clothing, housewares, and other non-supermarket products. Sainsbury’s own brand products are categorized into one of three quality tiers; for example, the lasagna range is comprised of the Basics sub-brand for “good,” the core, Sainsbury’s label line for “better,” and the premium “Taste the Difference” line for “best.” Sainsbury’s began a major overhaul of these various brand lines in 2010.

Private-label appeal is widespread. In supermarkets, private-label sales have always been strong in product categories such as dairy goods, vegetables, and beverages. More recently, private labels have been successful in previously “untouchable” categories such as cigarettes, disposable diapers, and cold remedies. *Consumer Reports* conducted a study on private labels published in September 2010. Key findings included the facts that 84 percent of U.S. consumers have purchased a store brand and 93 percent of store-brand shoppers indicated that they would continue to purchase private labels even as the economy recovered.⁹⁹

Nevertheless, some categories have not seen a strong private-label presence. Many shoppers, for example, still seem unwilling to trust their hair, complexion, or dental care to store brands. Private labels also have been relatively unsuccessful in categories such as candy, cereal, pet foods, baby food, and beer.

One implication that can be drawn from this pattern of product purchases is that consumers are being more selective in what they buy, no longer choosing to buy only national brands. For less important products in particular, consumers seem to feel “that the very best is unnecessary and good is good enough.” Categories that are particularly vulnerable to private-label advances are those in which there is little perceived quality differences among brands in the eyes of a sizable group of consumers, for example, over-the-counter pain relievers, bottled water, plastic bags, paper towels, and dairy products.
