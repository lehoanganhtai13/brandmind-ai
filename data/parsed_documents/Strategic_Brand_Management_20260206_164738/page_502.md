customer base too small to warrant advertising and promotional expenditures. The Polaroid camera is an example. After filing for bankruptcy in 2001, the brand was purchased by a private equity firm. A 2003 market research study indicated the brand name itself was still a powerful asset, so the Polaroid name soon appeared on electronic devices much more sophisticated than its outmoded instant camera, such as TVs and DVDs. These items, which achieved distribution in Walmart and Target, generated a reported $300 million in annual sales, proving that the orphan Polaroid still had some life in it. [27]

With the right marketing approach, it is possible to bring a jettisoned brand back to life. As another example, 3M spinoff Imation purchased Memorex, famous for its audio cassettes and “Is It Live, or Is It Memorex?” ads, for $330 million in 2006. Although that tagline had been dropped over 30 years ago, consumers surveys found awareness for the brand still exceeded 95 percent. Targeting mothers aged 28–40 who liked technology the family could use together, Memorex was relaunched to brand iPod accessories, digital photo frames, DVD and MP3 players, karaoke machines, and TVs at retailers such as Walmart and Target.

When the brand is beyond repair, marketers have to take more drastic measures, such as consolidating it into a stronger brand. Procter & Gamble merged White Cloud and Charmin toilet paper, eliminating the White Cloud line. It also merged Solo and Bold detergents. With shelf space at a premium, brand consolidation has become increasingly necessary to create a stronger brand, cut costs, and focus marketing efforts. [29]

Finally, a permanent solution is to discontinue the product altogether. The marketplace is littered with brands that either failed to establish an adequate level of brand equity or saw their sources of brand equity disappear because of changes in the marketing environment. Companies sometimes spin off their orphan brands when sales drop too far, as Campbell did with Vlasic pickles and Swanson frozen dinners. Similarly, American Home Products spun off Chef Boyardee, Bumble Bee tuna, and Pam cooking spray. Other companies sell the orphan, as Procter & Gamble did by selling its Oxydol laundry detergent to Redox Brands.

Harvard professor Nancy Koehn explains that old brands retain some value because consumers often remember them from childhood. “There’s at least an unconscious link,” says Koehn. [30] Perhaps this fact helps explain the success of a Web site called www.hometownfavorites.com, which offers hundreds of exotic orphan brands such as Brer Rabbit Molasses and My-T-Fine Pudding. As long as orphan brands remain popular with a core audience, it seems that companies are willing to sell them. [31]

**Obsoleting Existing Products.**  
How do you decide which brands to attempt to revitalize (or at least milk) and which ones to discontinue? Beecham chose to abandon such dying brands as 5-Day deodorant pads, Rose Milk skin care lotion, and Serutan laxative, but it attempted to resurrect Aqua Velva aftershave, Geritol iron and vitamin supplement, and Brylcreem hair styling products. The decision to retire a brand depends on a number of factors.
