Three classic U.S. tourism slogans, “I Love New York,” “Virginia Is for Lovers,” and Las Vegas’s “What Happens Here, Stays Here,” are for these more specific types of locales.

Marketers can establish a geographic or country-of-origin association in different ways. They can embed the location in the brand name, such as Idaho potatoes, Irish Spring soap, or South African Airways, or combine it with a brand name in some way as in Bailey’s Irish Cream. Or they can make the location the dominant theme in brand advertising, as has been the case for Coors with Foster’s beer.

Some countries have even created advertising campaigns to promote their products. For example, “Rums of Puerto Rico” advertise that they are the finest-quality rums, leading to a 70 percent share of U.S. brand sales.<sup>8</sup> Other countries have developed and advertised labels or seals for their products.<sup>9</sup> Branding Brief 7-2 describes how New Zealand’s launch of its “The New Zealand Way” brand has led to much marketing success for the country.

Because it’s typically a legal necessity for the country of origin to appear somewhere on the product or package, associations to the country of origin almost always have the potential to be created at the point of purchase and to affect brand decisions there. The question really is one of relative emphasis, and the role of country of origin or other geographic regions throughout the marketing program. Becoming strongly linked to a country of origin or specific geographic region is not without potential disadvantages. Events or actions associated with the country may color people’s perceptions.<sup>10</sup>

### BRAND AMERICA

The turn of the century and George W. Bush’s presidency coincided with sharp drop in the image of the United States in the eyes of the world’s citizens. A comprehensive analysis by Pew Research Center in 2008 concluded:<sup>11</sup>

> The U.S. image abroad is suffering almost everywhere. Particularly in the most economically developed countries, people blame America for the financial crisis. Opposition to key elements of American foreign policy is widespread in Western Europe, and positive views of the U.S. have declined steeply among many of America’s longtime European allies. In Muslim nations, the wars in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq have driven negative ratings nearly off the charts. The United States earns positive ratings in several Asian and Latin American nations, but usually by declining margins.

One BBC-commissioned poll of 26,000 respondents in the 25 largest countries in 2007 found that roughly half thought the United States had a “mostly negative” influence on the world. A global economic recession, unpopular wars, and disagreements on various social and environmental policies took their toll. Although few global U.S. companies experienced the same erosion in reputation—many people seemed willing to compartmentalize politics and commerce—restoring U.S. image became a popular theme with the election of Barack Obama in 2008. Recognizing the importance of tourism to the U.S. economy—one in nine U.S. jobs is in a travel or tourism-related sector—the U.S. Travel Association has been aggressively marketing visits to the United States to the international travel industry.<sup>12</sup>

Finally, consider the favorability of a country-of-origin association from both a domestic and a foreign perspective. In the domestic market, country-of-origin perceptions may stir consumers’ patriotic notions or remind them of their past. As international trade grows, consumers may view certain brands as symbolically important of their own cultural heritage and identity. Some research found that domestic brands were more strongly favored in collectivistic countries such as Japan and other Asian countries that have strong group norms and ties to family and country. In individualistic societies such as the United States and other Western countries that are more guided by self-interest and personal goals, consumers demand stronger evidence of product superiority.<sup>13</sup>

Patriotic appeals have been the basis of marketing strategies all over the world. However, they can lack uniqueness and even be overused. For example, during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, a number of different U.S. brands in a diverse range of product categories including cars, beer, and clothing used pro-U.S. themes in their advertising, perhaps diluting the efforts of all as a result. In recent years, the debate over outsourcing and offshoring and, tragically, the events of September 11, 2001, raised the visibility of patriotic appeals once again.
