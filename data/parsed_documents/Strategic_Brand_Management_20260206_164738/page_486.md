The way brand meaning is reinforced may depend on the nature of brand associations. We next look at specific considerations in terms of product-related performance and non-product-related imagery associations.

### Product-Related Performance Associations.

For brands whose core associations are primarily product-related performance attributes or benefits, innovation in product design, manufacturing, and merchandising is especially critical to maintaining or enhancing brand equity. Consider how Timex has evolved through the years to maintain its market position.

## TIMEX

Timex has had a fascinating journey through time as it has dealt with a wave of competitors and changes in the marketing environment through the years. The origins of the brand stretch back into the nineteenth century, but its modern history began post–World War II with the launch of its popular line of inexpensive, durable wristwatches. Buoyed by “torture test” product demonstration ads and the clever slogan, “Takes a Licking and Keeps on Ticking,” the brand became the market leader by the end of the 1950s. In subsequent years, after Timex watched brands such as Casio and Swatch gain significant market share by emphasizing digital technology and fashion (respectively) in their watches, it made a number of innovative marketing changes. Within a short period of time, Timex introduced Indiglo glow-in-the-dark technology, showcased popular new models such as the Ironman in mass media advertising, and launched new Timex stores to showcase its products. The company also expanded its brand portfolio by buying the Guess and Monet watch brands to distribute through upscale department stores. These innovations in product design and merchandising significantly revived the brand’s fortunes. In recent years, however, the growth of smartphones and other hand-held mobile devices that can tell time have posed yet more challenges. Once again, Timex responded by increasing the functionality of its watches. Beyond telling time, its new watches boast GPS technology and health-rate monitors and other wellness features.⁷
