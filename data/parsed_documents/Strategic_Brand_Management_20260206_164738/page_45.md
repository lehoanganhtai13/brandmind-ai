## GOOGLE

Founded in 1998 by two Stanford University Ph.D. students, Google takes its name from a play on the word *googol*—the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes—a reference to the huge amount of data online. Google’s stated mission is “To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” The company has become the market leader in the search engine industry through its business focus and constant innovation. Its home page focuses on searches but also allows users to employ many other Google services. By focusing on plain text, avoiding pop-up ads, and using sophisticated search algorithms, Google provides fast and reliable service. Google’s revenue traditionally was driven by search ads, text-based boxes that advertisers pay for only when users click on them. Increasingly, Google is seeking additional sources of revenue from new services and acquisitions.<sup>23</sup>
