Specifically, applying Mandler’s congruity theory, Meyers-Levy and her colleagues showed that products associated with moderately incongruent brand names could be preferred over ones that were associated with either congruent or extremely incongruent brand names. They interpreted this finding in terms of the ability of moderately incongruent brand extensions to elicit more processing from consumers that could be satisfactorily resolved (assuming consumers could identify a meaningful relationship between the brand name and the product).

Curren, “How Does the Congruity of Brand Names Affect Evaluations of Brand Name Extensions?” *Journal of Applied Psychology* 79, no. 1 (1994): 46–53. See also Eyal Maoz and Alice M.
