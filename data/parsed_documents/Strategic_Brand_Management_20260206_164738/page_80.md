Because the brand is linked to the product category, some category associations may also become linked to the brand, either specific beliefs or overall attitudes. Product category attitudes can be a particularly important determinant of consumer response. For example, if a consumer thinks that all brokerage houses are basically greedy and that brokers are in it for themselves, then he or she probably will have similarly unfavorable beliefs about and negative attitudes toward any particular brokerage house, simply by virtue of its membership in the category.

Thus, in almost all cases, some product category associations will be shared with all brands in the category. Note that the strength of the brand associations to the product category is an important determinant of brand awareness.⁽²⁸⁾

# IDENTIFYING AND ESTABLISHING BRAND POSITIONING

Having developed the CBBE concept in some detail as background, we next outline how marketers should approach brand positioning.

## Basic Concepts

**Brand positioning** is at the heart of marketing strategy. It is the “act of designing the company’s offer and image so that it occupies a distinct and valued place in the target customer’s minds.”⁽²⁹⁾ As the name implies, positioning means finding the proper “location” in the minds of a group of consumers or market segment, so that they think about a product or service in the “right” or desired way to maximize potential benefit to the firm. Good brand positioning helps guide marketing strategy by clarifying what a brand is all about, how it is unique and how it is similar to competitive brands, and why consumers should purchase and use it.

Deciding on a positioning requires determining a frame of reference (by identifying the target market and the nature of competition) and the optimal points-of-parity and points-of-difference brand associations. In other words, marketers need to know (1) who the target consumer is, (2) who the main competitors are, (3) how the brand is similar to these competitors, and (4) how the brand is different from them. We’ll talk about each of these.

## Target Market

Identifying the consumer target is important because different consumers may have different brand knowledge structures and thus different perceptions and preferences for the brand. Without this understanding, it may be difficult for marketers to say which brand associations should be strongly held, favorable, and unique. Let’s look at defining and segmenting a market and choosing target market segments.

A *market* is the set of all actual and potential buyers who have sufficient interest in, income for, and access to a product. *Market segmentation* divides the market into distinct groups of homogeneous consumers who have similar needs and consumer behavior, and who thus require similar marketing mixes. Market segmentation requires making trade-offs between costs and benefits. The more finely segmented the market, the more likely that the firm will be able to implement marketing programs that meet the needs of consumers in any one segment. That advantage, however, can be offset by the greater costs of reduced standardization.

### Segmentation Bases.

Figures 2-3 and 2-4 display some possible segmentation bases for consumer and business-to-business markets, respectively. We can classify these bases as descriptive or customer-oriented (related to what kind of person or organization the customer is), or as behavioral or product-oriented (related to how the customer thinks of or uses the brand or product).

Behavioral segmentation bases are often most valuable in understanding branding issues because they have clearer strategic implications. For example, defining a benefit segment makes it clear what should be the ideal point-of-difference or desired benefit with which to establish the positioning. Take the toothpaste market. One research study uncovered four main segments:⁽³⁰⁾

1. The *Sensory Segment*: Seeking flavor and product appearance  
2. The *Sociables*: Seeking brightness of teeth  
3. The *Worriers*: Seeking decay prevention  
4. The *Independent Segment*: Seeking low price Consumer Segmentation Bases</p>
