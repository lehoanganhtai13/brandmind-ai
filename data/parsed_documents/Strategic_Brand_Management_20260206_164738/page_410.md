# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 11-3

## Corporate Brand Personality

The success of a twenty-first-century company will be a function of many different characteristics—its mission, structure, processes, culture, and so on. One important characteristic is its corporate brand personality.

Formally, we can define **corporate brand personality** as “a form of brand personality specific to a corporate brand” and “the human characteristics or traits that can be attributed to a corporate brand.” Despite the fact that the concept of brand personality applies to both product brands and corporate brands, because corporate brands are designed to encompass a wider range of associations than the product brands that might fall under them, the dimensions are not necessarily the same.

One approach maintains that a successful twenty-first-century corporation’s brand personality must reflect three core dimensions: the “heart,” the “mind,” and the “body” (see Figure 11-8).

* The “heart” of a company reflects two traits: it is *passionate* and *compassionate*. Employees should be passionate about their jobs, their business and industry, their firm’s products and services, and what they can do for their customers. The company must also have compassion and care deeply about its customers, employees, stakeholders, the communities in which it operates, and the environment as a whole.
* The “mind” of a company is *creative* and *disciplined*. A successful twenty-first-century company must be creative in its approach to serving its customers, transcending the current status quo, finding new solutions to old problems, and overcoming the trade-offs faced by all businesses. Yet it must also be disciplined and stay focused, avoiding the “grass is greener” syndrome and the latest management fads, finding truly promising growth opportunities, and ensuring that it takes appropriate and consistent actions.
* The “body” of a company is *agile* and *collaborative*. It must anticipate changes that will be necessary in the future, move forward quickly, and nimbly react to changes in the market. A successful twenty-first-century company must also be collaborative, fostering an internal culture of interdepartmental teamwork and establishing an external network of partners that share common corporate values and beliefs and offer complementary and synergistic assets and competencies.

Figure 11-8 outlines "Corporate Personality Traits" structured around three core components: "Heart," "Body," and "Mind." The "Heart" encompasses traits like Passionate and Compassionate, suggesting emotional and empathetic dimensions of a corporate personality. The "Body" is characterized by Agile and Disciplined, representing the operational and structural aspects. The "Mind" is associated with Creative and Collaborative, indicating the cognitive and interactive elements. This framework presents a comparative structure, juxtaposing specific traits under each of the three overarching corporate personality components, thereby offering a multi-faceted view of organizational character.

These three core dimensions of corporate personality have a multiplicative, not merely an additive, effect. For example, passion can drive creativity in an organization. In turn, creativity spurs agility, as more creative firms are able to rapidly find solutions to problems or recognize new opportunities. Discipline engenders better collaborative efforts, as employees more readily establish and follow guidelines and partnership principles.

These dimensions of corporate personality traits are important to build in a brand, because the corporation competing in the twenty-first century will be defined “as much by who it is as *what* it does.” This contrasts with the historical case for corporations, in which a company drew its identity primarily from products and services it sold and its actions in the market.

A company’s employees are, in many cases, the outward face of the company that consumers see, and they define “who” a corporation is. They embody the personality traits the company has established. If all employees act with a “heart,” “mind,” and “body,” then the company will be better positioned to achieve success in the twenty-first-century business environment.

## Corporate Image Dimensions

A corporate image will depend on a number of factors, such as the products a company makes, the actions it takes, and the manner in which it communicates to consumers. This section highlights some of the different types of associations that are likely to be linked to a corporate brand and that can affect brand equity (see Figure 11-9).<sup>32</sup>

### Common Product Attributes, Benefits, or Attitudes.

Like individual brands, a corporate or company brand may evoke in consumers a strong association to a product attribute (Hershey with “chocolate”), type of user (BMW with “yuppies”), usage situation (Club Med with “fun times”), or overall judgment (Sony with “quality”).
