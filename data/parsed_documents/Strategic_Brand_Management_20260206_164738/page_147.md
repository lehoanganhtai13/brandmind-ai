# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 4-1

## Counterfeit Business Is Booming

The current size of the counterfeit market is estimated to be $600 billion, representing costs of $200–$250 billion annually to U.S. businesses. The fakes are soaking up profits faster than multinationals can squash counterfeiting operations, and they’re getting tougher and tougher to distinguish from the real thing. The difference can be as subtle as lesser-quality leather in a purse or fake batteries inside a cell phone. And counterfeiters can produce fakes cheaply by cutting corners on safety and quality, as well as by avoiding paying for marketing, R&D, or advertising.

It’s not just luxury items and consumer electronics that are being copied. The World Health Organization says up to 10 percent of medicines worldwide are counterfeited. Those drugs not only purloin pharmaceutical industry profits but also present a danger to anyone who takes them because they are manufactured under inadequate safety controls.

Counterfeiting has become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. To avoid being detected, counterfeiters are knocking off smaller brands that don’t have the resources to fight back, focusing on fewer high-end brands given the recent economic downturn, and increasing prices on fake goods sold over the Web to counter consumer suspicions.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s office now publishes an annual “notorious markets” list of the worst sites—physical and online—for piracy and counterfeiting. These days, 81 percent of counterfeit goods in the United States come from China. Other sources are Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan, India, Mexico, and several countries in Southeast Asia (Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia) and Latin America (Ecuador, Paraguay, and Argentina).

The operations are financed by such varied sources as Middle East businessmen who invest in facilities in Asian countries for export, local Chinese entrepreneurs, and criminal networks. Online auction retailers such as eBay and China’s Baidu have become unintentional middlemen in the market and have been successfully sued for millions by luxury makers such as LVMH (which makes Louis Vuitton, among other brands).

The replication process has also speeded up as counterfeiters have honed their engineering skills and increased their speed. Chinese factories can now copy a new model of a golf club in less than a week. And executives at a variety of companies say counterfeiters have no trouble copying holograms and other security devices intended to distinguish real products from fakes.

Producing counterfeit goods is as profitable as trading in illegal drugs but does not carry the same risk. In many countries, convicted counterfeiters get off with a fine of a few thousand dollars. Chinese authorities have ignored the problem for years, mostly because it did not hurt Chinese industries. But as the country’s corporate interests grow and Chinese companies start getting hurt by the counterfeit industry, experts say the Chinese government will be more cooperative. They believe China is the key to stemming the counterfeit trade.

Some companies have decided to target the end users of knockoff products, hoping manufacturers will eventually be forced to get a license and pay royalties. And some patent holders are beginning to get creative and target anyone on the supply chain who knowingly ignores counterfeit businesses. Louis Vuitton has partnered with New York City landlords to prevent the sale of counterfeit Louis Vuitton goods by tenants on notorious knockoff hot spot Canal Street. But because the business of counterfeiting thrives on globalization, experts say all many companies can do for now is hope to slow, not stop, the counterfeiters.

Interestingly, some provocative academic research shows that fake products are not uniformly bad for companies. Although some consumers may initially feel pleased at buying a fake handbag, for example, many ultimately realize the fake cannot replace the genuine item. While some who cannot afford to buy genuine luxury items may always buy fakes, other consumers will find that buying a counterfeit motivates them to later buy the real thing.
