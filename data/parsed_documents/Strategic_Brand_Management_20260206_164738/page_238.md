Online ads and videos also can extend the creative or legal restrictions of traditional print and broadcast media to persuasively communicate brand positioning and elicit positive judgments and feelings.

Unfortunately, there are also many disadvantages. Many consumers find it easy to ignore banner ads and screen them out with pop-up filters. The average click-through rate for a standard banner ad in the United States was 0.08 percent in 2010, although that number increased to 0.14 percent for an expandable rich media banner. Similar percentages could be found in European and Latin American countries. Even in ad categories drawing exceptional interest from consumers, the percentages barely increased (to 1.02 percent for auto in Italy, 1.9 percent for health and beauty in Poland, and the biggest percentage, almost 8 percent for restaurants in Belgium).<sup>48</sup>

Increasingly, Web messages like streaming ads are drawing closer to traditional forms of television advertising. Videos take that one step further by virtually becoming short films. BMW, one of the pioneers, created a series of highly successful made-for-the-Web movies using well-known directors such as Guy Ritchie and actors such as Madonna. The advantage of videos is the enormous potential pass-along that exists if an imaginative video strikes a chord with consumers, as was the case for Coke.<sup>49</sup>

## COKE’S “HAPPINESS MACHINE”

Coca-Cola’s “Open Happiness” global brand slogan and platform lends itself to many different creative ideas and executions. Besides its usual iconic ads, the company decided it also wanted to activate the idea digitally in an equally inspired way. To do so, Coca-Cola rigged up a special vending machine at St. John’s University in Queens, New York, dubbed the “Happiness Machine.” The back of the machine was connected to a storeroom filled with all the people and props necessary to execute the stunt. When unsuspecting students started to use the machine, they first just received Cokes, but after that, all kinds of goodies began to appear—a bouquet of sunflowers, balloon animals, six-foot subs, and even a hot pepperoni pizza. Their astonished and gleeful reactions were caught by hidden cameras and fed into YouTube videos that received millions of hits and even became the basis of a 30-second TV spot shown all over the world.

Coca-Cola’s “Happiness Machine” was a clever brand-building stunt that was seen virally all over the world.
