### Brands as a Direction for the Future.

The brand knowledge that marketers create over time dictates appropriate and inappropriate future directions for the brand. Consumers will decide, based on their brand knowledge, where they think the brand should go and grant permission (or not) to any marketing action or program. Thus, at the end of the day, the true value and future prospects of a brand rest with consumers and their knowledge about the brand.

No matter how we define brand equity, though, its value to marketers as a concept ultimately depends on how they use it. Brand equity can offer focus and guidance, providing a means to interpret past marketing performance and design future marketing programs. Everything the firm does can help enhance or detract from brand equity. Those marketers who build strong brands have embraced the concept and use it to its fullest as a means of clarifying, communicating, and implementing their marketing actions.

### DISCOVERY CHANNEL

The Discovery Channel was launched with the motto “Explore Your World” and well-defined brand values of adventure, exploration, science, and curiosity. After a detour to reality programming featuring crime and forensics shows and biker and car content, the channel returned to its mission of producing high-quality work that the company could be proud of and that was beneficial for people. Today, Discovery’s 13 U.S. channels cumulatively reach 745 million subscribing households, and its 120 overseas channels in 180 countries reach 969 million homes. One hundred fifty thousand hours of content supplied by Discovery Education is used by more than 1 million teachers in half of all schools in the United States. Discovery’s Web sites attract 24 million unique visitors every month. The company also launched *Discovery Channel Magazine* in Asia.<sup>5</sup>

Other factors can influence brand success, and brand equity has meaning for other constituents besides customers, such as employees, suppliers, channel members, media, and the government.<sup>6</sup> Nevertheless, success with customers is often crucial for success for the firm, so the next section considers brand knowledge and CBBE in more detail. The process of creating such brand power is not without its critics, however, as described in *The Science of Branding* 2-1.

## MAKING A BRAND STRONG: BRAND KNOWLEDGE

From the perspective of the CBBE concept, brand knowledge is the key to creating brand equity, because it creates the differential effect that drives brand equity. What marketers need, then, is an insightful way to represent how brand knowledge exists in consumer memory. An influential model of memory developed by psychologists is helpful for this purpose.<sup>7</sup>

The *associative network memory model* views memory as a network of nodes and connecting links, in which nodes represent stored information or concepts, and links represent In her book *No Logo*, Naomi Klein details the aspects of global corporate growth that have led to consumer backlash against brands.
