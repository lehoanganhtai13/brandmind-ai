## Overseeing Brand Equity.

To provide central coordination, the firm should establish a position responsible for overseeing the implementation of the brand charter and brand equity reports, to ensure that product and marketing actions across divisions and geographic boundaries reflect their spirit as closely as possible and maximize the long-term equity of the brand. A natural place to house such oversight duties and responsibilities is in a corporate marketing group that has a senior management reporting relationship.

Scott Bedbury, who helped direct the Nike and Starbucks brands during some of their most successful years, is emphatic about the need for “top-down brand leadership.”[^23] He advocates the addition of a chief brand officer (CBO) who reports directly to the CEO of the company and who:

* **Is an omnipresent conscience whose job is to champion and protect the brand—the way it looks and feels—both inside and outside the company.** The CBO recognizes that the brand is the sum total of everything a company does and strives to ensure that all employees understand the brand and its values, creating “brand disciples” in the process.
* **Is an architect and not only helps build the brand but also plans, anticipates, researches, probes, listens, and informs.** Working with senior leadership, the CBO helps envision not just what works best for the brand today but also what can help drive it forward in the future.
* **Determines and protects the voice of the brand over time by taking a long-term (two to three years) perspective.** The CBO can be accountable for brand-critical and corporate-wide activities such as advertising, positioning, corporate design, corporate communications, and consumer or market insights.

Bedbury also advocates periodic brand development reviews (full-day meetings quarterly, or even half-day meetings monthly) for brands in difficult circumstances. As part of a brand development review, he suggests the following topics and activities:[^24]

* *Review brand-sensitive material:* For example, review brand strength monitors or tracking studies, brand audits, and focus groups, as well as less formal personal observations or “gut feelings.”
* *Review the status of key brand initiatives:* Because brand initiatives include strategic thrusts to either strengthen a weakness in the brand or exploit an opportunity to grow the brand in a new direction, customer perceptions may change and marketers therefore need to assess them.
* *Review brand-sensitive projects:* For example, evaluate advertising campaigns, corporate communications, sales meeting agendas, and important human resources programs (recruitment, training, and retention that profoundly affect the organization’s ability to embrace and project brand values).
* *Review new product and distribution strategies with respect to core brand values:* For example, evaluate licensing the brand to penetrate new markets, forming joint ventures to develop new products or brands, and expanding distribution to nontraditional platforms such as large-scale discount retailers.
* *Resolve brand positioning conflicts:* Identify and resolve any inconsistencies in positioning across channels, business units, or markets.

Even strong brands need careful watching to prevent managers from assuming it’s acceptable to “make one little mistake” with brand equity or to “let it slide.” A number of top companies like Colgate-Palmolive, Canada Dry, Quaker Oats, Pillsbury, Coca-Cola, and Nestlé Foods have created brand equity gatekeepers for some or all their brands at one time.[^25] Branding Brief 8-3 contains a checklist by which firms can assess their marketing skills and performance.

One of senior management’s important roles is to determine marketing budgets and decide where and how to allocate company resources within the organization. The brand equity management system must be able to inform and provide input to decision makers so that they can recognize the short-term and long-term ramifications of their decisions for brand equity. Decisions about which brands to invest in, and whether to implement brand-building marketing programs or leverage brand equity through brand extensions instead, should reflect the current and desired state of the brand as revealed through brand tracking and other measures.

## Organizational Design and Structures.

The firm should organize its marketing function to optimize brand equity. Several trends have emerged in organizational design and structure Famed former London Business School professor Tim Ambler has a wealth of experience in working with companies.
