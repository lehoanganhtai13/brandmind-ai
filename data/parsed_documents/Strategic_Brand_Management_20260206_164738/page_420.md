Finally, the desire to create distance from scandal can also motivate a name change. A new name cannot repair a company’s damaged reputation, though, and experts advise against making a switch in the midst of bad publicity; otherwise the stigma and suspicion will follow the new name. Philip Morris Co. decided to change its name to get away from its association with tobacco and emphasize its range of companies, including Kraft Foods, so in 2003, it adopted the new name Altria Group Inc. After its name was tarnished by human rights violations, military support firm Blackwater changed its name to Xe in 2007 and then again to Academi in 2011.⁵⁷

**Guidelines.** Although renaming can yield growth opportunities, experts recommend a cautious approach. Name changes are typically complicated, time-consuming, and expensive and firms should undertake them only when compelling marketing or financial considerations prevail and a proper supporting marketing program can be put into place. A new corporate name cannot hide product or other deficiencies, and it requires extensive legal and URL vetting to make sure it is available and appropriate. Rebranding campaigns also usually forfeit the brand recognition and loyalty attached to the old name.

Many of the branding issues we discussed in Chapter 4 are relevant in choosing or changing a corporate name. Given the corporate branding strategy and marketing objectives, firms should evaluate candidate names in terms of memorability, meaningfulness, likability, protectability, adaptability, and transferability. If the consumer market is the primary objective, the name may reflect or be suggestive of certain product characteristics, benefits, or values. Consolidated Foods Corporation switched to Sara Lee Corporation, Castle & Cooke, Inc. to Dole Food Company, and United Brands Company to Chiquita Brands International.

Once the firm has chosen the new name, the substantial task of introducing it to employees, customers, suppliers, investors, and the public begins—often with the launch of a new marketing campaign and the opportunity to work with a blank canvas. Corporate rebranding is a time- and resource-intensive process that demands a company’s total commitment to succeed. A company with little consumer exposure may spend as much as $5 million on research, advertising, and other marketing costs (new signs, stationery, business cards, Web site, and so on) to change its identity, but a company with a high public profile may have to spend up to $100 million or more.⁵⁸ Macy’s moved too quickly in rebranding beloved Chicago department store Marshall Fields after its acquisition, raising the ire of many of its former customers.
