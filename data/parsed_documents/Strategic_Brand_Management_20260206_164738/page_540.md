## MARLBORO

In the 1950s, Marlboro’s brand slogan was “Mild as May.” In repositioning the brand, Philip Morris created the Marlboro man, a cowboy who was almost always depicted somewhere in the western United States among magnificent scenery deemed “Marlboro country.” By 1975, Marlboro had become the best-selling cigarette in the United States. By 2010, it controlled 43 percent of the U.S. market, more than the next 13 brands combined. But the appeal of the Marlboro man extends far beyond the United States. Indeed, the cowboy imagery attracts consumers from all over the world, in part by capturing an image that is uniquely American. Today the Marlboro man appears in over 180 countries, and Marlboro is the biggest-selling brand in the United States, France, Germany, Mexico, and nine other major global markets. The brand is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most valuable, due in large part to the widespread appeal of its brand character and personality.⁷⁷

Even nonverbal elements, however, can encounter translation problems. For example, certain colors have strong cultural meaning. Marketing campaigns using various shades of green in advertising, packaging, and other marketing programs ran into trouble in Malaysia, where these colors symbolize death and disease.⁷⁸

Because of a desire to standardize globally, however, many firms have attempted to create more uniform brand elements. Pursuing a global branding strategy, Mars chose to replace its Treets and Bonitos brands with the M&M’s brand worldwide and changed the name of its third-largest U.K. brand—Marathon—to the Snickers name used in the rest of Europe and the United States.⁷⁹ To create a stronger global brand, PepsiCo pulled together its dozens of company-owned brands of potato chips sold under different names and began to market them all abroad under a more uniform Lay’s logo. The company also boosted advertising and improved quality to enhance the brand image at the same time.⁸⁰

## REVIEW

Increasingly, marketers must properly define and implement a global branding strategy. Some advantages of a global marketing program are economies of scale in production and distribution, lower marketing costs, communication of power and scope, consistency in brand image, an ability to leverage good ideas quickly and efficiently, and uniformity of marketing practices and thus greater competitiveness. The more standardized the marketing program, in general, the more the firm can actually realize these different advantages.

At the same time, the primary disadvantages of a standardized global marketing program are that it may ignore important differences across countries in various areas: consumer needs, wants, and usage patterns for products; consumer response to marketing mix elements; product development and the competitive environment; the legal environment; marketing institutions; and administrative procedures.

In developing a global marketing program, marketers attempt to obtain as many of these advantages as possible while minimizing any possible disadvantages. Building global customer-based brand equity means creating brand awareness and a positive brand image in each country in which the brand is sold.

Increasingly, marketers are blending global objectives with local or regional concerns. The means by which brand equity is built may differ from country to country, or the actual sources of brand equity themselves may vary across countries in terms of specific attribute or benefit associations. Nevertheless, there must be sufficient levels of brand awareness and strong, favorable, and unique brand associations in each country in which the brand is sold to provide sources of brand equity.

Some of the biggest differences in global marketing occur between developed and developing or emerging markets. Because of the extremely low incomes and differences in consumer behavior in developing markets, marketers must fundamentally rethink every aspect of their marketing program.
