Figure 9-9 presents a Brand Engagement Scale, developed to measure the importance of brand engagement on market behavior. The scale comprises eight statements designed to capture the depth of a consumer's connection with their preferred brands. These statements explore the concept of a "special bond" and "personal connection" with brands, suggesting that consumers may consider their favorite brands to be an integral part of their identity, defining aspects of themselves and indicating who they are. The scale's structure implies a hierarchical or multi-faceted approach to understanding brand engagement, moving from a general sense of connection to a more profound identification and self-definition through brands.

## Attitudinal Attachment

(1) This is a wonderful brand;  
(2) This brand makes me feel good;  
(3) This brand is totally awesome;  
(4) I have neutral feelings about this brand (reverse-coded item);  
(5) This brand makes me very happy;  
(6) I love this brand;  
(7) I have no particular feelings about this brand (reverse-coded item);  
(8) This brand is a pure delight;  
(9) I am passionate about this brand; and  
(10) I am very attached to this brand.<sup>50</sup>

Another study found 11 dimensions that characterized brand love:<sup>51</sup>

1. **Passion** (for the brand).  
2. **Duration of the relationship** (the relationship with the brand exists for a long time).  
3. **Self-congruity** (congruity between self-image and product image).  
4. **Dreams** (the brand favors consumer dreams).  
5. **Memories** (evoked by the brand).  
6. **Pleasure** (that the brand provides to the consumer).  
7. **Attraction** (feel toward the brand).  
8. **Uniqueness** (of the brand and/or of the relationship).  
9. **Beauty** (of the brand).  
10. **Trust** (the brand has never disappointed).  
11. **Declaration of affect** (feel toward the brand).

One promising approach defines brand attachment in terms of two underlying constructs—brand-self connections and brand prominence—where each of those two dimensions have two subdimensions, suggesting the following sets of measures:<sup>52</sup>

1. **Brand-Self Connection**  
   a. *Connected:* “To what extent do you feel that you are personally connected to (Brand)?”  
   b. *Part of Who You Are:* “To what extent is (Brand) part of you and who you are?”

2. **Brand Prominence**  
   a. *Automatic:* “To what extent are your thoughts and feelings towards (Brand) often automatic, coming to mind seemingly on their own?”  
   b. *Naturally:* “To what extent do your thoughts and feelings towards (Brand) come to you naturally and instantly?”

## Sense of Community

Although measuring behavioral loyalty and attitudinal attachment may require a fairly structured set of questions, both sense of community and active engagement could call for more varied measures because of their diverse set of issues.

One interesting concept that has been proposed with respect to community is *social currency*, developed by brand consultants Vivaldi Partners. They define social currency as “the extent to which people share the brand or information about the brand as part of their everyday social lives at work or at home.” Figure 9-10 displays the different dimensions that make up the social currency concept according to Vivaldi Partners.
