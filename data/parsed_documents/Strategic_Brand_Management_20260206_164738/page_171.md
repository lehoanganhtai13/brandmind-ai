Although it is available in such desirable retail outlets as Target and Lowe’s, the company believes its marketing must work harder to express the brand positioning given its limited advertising budget. In addition to its attractive packaging, the company is capitalizing on growing interest in green products by emphasizing its nontoxic, nonpolluting ingredients. It is also developing a strong brand personality as hip, modern, and somewhat irreverent as reflected by its slogan, “People Against Dirty.”<sup>81</sup>

## REVIEW

Brand elements are those trademarkable devices that identify and differentiate the brand. The main ones are brand names, URLs, logos, symbols, characters, slogans, jingles, and packages. Brand elements can both enhance brand awareness and facilitate the formation of strong, favorable, and unique brand associations.

Six criteria are particularly important.  
First, brand elements should be inherently memorable, easy to recognize, and easy to recall.  
Second, they should be inherently meaningful to convey information about the nature of the product category, the particular attributes and benefits of a brand, or both. The brand element may even reflect brand personality, user or usage imagery, or feelings for the brand.  
Third, the information conveyed by brand elements does not necessarily have to relate to the product alone and may simply be inherently appealing or likable.  
Fourth, brand elements can be transferable within and across product categories to support line and brand extensions, and across geographic and cultural boundaries and market segments.  
Fifth, brand elements should be adaptable and flexible over time.  
Finally, they should be legally protectable and, as much as possible, competitively defensible. Brand Focus 4.0 outlines some of the key legal considerations in protecting the brand.
