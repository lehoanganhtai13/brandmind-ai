# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 9-1

## Understanding Categorical Brand Recall

A classic experiment by Prakash Nedungadi provides a compelling demonstration of the importance of understanding the category structure that exists in consumer memory as well as the value of strategies for increasing the recallability or accessibility of brands during choice situations. As a preliminary step in his research study, Nedungadi first examined the category structure for fast-food restaurants that existed in consumers’ minds. He found that a “major subcategory” was “hamburger chains” and a “minor subcategory” was “sandwich shops.” He also found, on the basis of usage and linking surveys, that within the major subcategory of national hamburger chains, a major brand was McDonald’s and a minor brand was Wendy’s, and within the minor subcategory of local sandwich shops, a major brand was Joe’s Deli (a brand in his survey area) and a minor brand was Subway. Consistent with this reasoning, in an unaided recall and choice task, consumers were more likely to remember and select a brand from a major subcategory than from a minor subcategory and, within a subcategory, a major brand rather than a minor brand.

Nedungadi next looked at the effects of different brand “primes” on subsequent choices among the four fast-food restaurants. Brands were primed by having subjects in the experiment first answer a series of seemingly unrelated questions—including some about the brand to be primed—before making their brand selections. Two key findings emerged. First, a major brand that was primed was more likely to be selected in the later choice task even though attitudes toward the brand were no different from those of a control group. In other words, merely making the brand more accessible in memory increased the likelihood that it would be chosen *independent of any differences in brand attitude*. Second, priming a minor brand in a minor subcategory actually benefited the *major* brand in that subcategory more. In other words, by drawing attention to the minor subcategory of sandwich shops—which could easily be overlooked—the minor brand, Subway, indirectly primed the major brand, Joe’s Deli, in the subcategory. The implications of Nedungadi’s research are that marketers must understand how consumers’ memory is organized and, as much as possible, ensure that the proper cues and primes are evident to prompt brand recall.

In sum, brand recall provides insight into category structure and brand positioning in consumers’ minds. Brands tend to be recalled in categorical clusters when consumers are given a general probe. Certain brands are grouped together in memory because they share certain associations and are thus likely to cue and remind consumers of each other if one is recalled.

For example, consumers may have brand association beliefs for Sony PlayStation 3 entertainment system such as “fun and exciting,” “cool and hip,” “colorful,” “great graphics,” “advanced technology,” “variety of game titles,” and “sometimes violent.” They may also have associations to the brand logo and the slogan, “It Only Does Everything.” PlayStation 3 user imagery may be “used by teenagers or 20-something males who are serious about playing video games, especially sports games.”

In Chapter 2, we provided a structured set of measures to tap into performance and imagery associations. The qualitative research approaches we described earlier are useful in uncovering the different types of specific brand associations making up the brand image. To better understand their potential ability to serve as basis for brand positioning and how they might contribute to brand equity, we can assess belief associations on the basis of one or more of the three key dimensions—strength, favorability, and uniqueness—making up the sources of brand equity.

As a first cut, we can use open-ended measures that tap into the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations, as follows:

1. What are the strongest associations you have to the brand? What comes to mind when you think of the brand? (Strength)  
2. What is good about the brand? What do you like about the brand? What is bad about the brand? What do you dislike about the brand? (Favorability)  
3. What is unique about the brand? What characteristics or features does the brand share with other brands? (Uniqueness) 1.
