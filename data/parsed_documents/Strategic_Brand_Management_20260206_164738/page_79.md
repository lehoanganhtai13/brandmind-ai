## Strength of Brand Associations

Two factors that strengthen association to any piece of information are its personal relevance and the consistency with which it is presented over time. The particular associations we recall and their salience will depend not only on the strength of association, but also on the retrieval cues present and the context in which we consider the brand.

In general, direct experiences create the strongest brand attribute and benefit associations and are particularly influential in consumers’ decisions when they accurately interpret them. Word-of-mouth is likely to be particularly important for restaurants, entertainment, banking, and personal services. Starbucks, Google, Red Bull, and Amazon are all classic examples of companies that created amazingly rich brand images without the benefit of intensive advertising programs. Mike’s Hard Lemonade sold its first 10 million cases without any advertising because it was a “discovery” brand fueled by word-of-mouth.<sup>22</sup>

On the other hand, company-influenced sources of information, such as advertising, are often likely to create the weakest associations and thus may be the most easily changed. To overcome this hurdle, marketing communication programs use creative communications that cause consumers to elaborate on brand-related information and relate it appropriately to existing knowledge. They expose consumers to communications repeatedly over time, and ensure that many retrieval cues are present as reminders.

## Favorability of Brand Associations

Marketers create favorable brand associations by convincing consumers that the brand possesses relevant attributes and benefits that satisfy their needs and wants, such that they form positive overall brand judgments. Consumers will not hold all brand associations to be equally important, nor will they view them all favorably or value them all equally across different purchase or consumption situations. Brand associations may be situation- or context-dependent and vary according to what consumers want to achieve in that purchase or consumption decision.<sup>23</sup> An association may thus be valued in one situation but not another.<sup>24</sup>

For example, the associations that come to mind when consumers think of FedEx may be “fast,” “reliable,” and “convenient,” with “purple and orange packages.” The color of the packaging may matter little to most consumers when actually choosing an overnight delivery service, although it may perhaps play an important brand awareness function. Fast, reliable, and convenient service may be more important, but even then only under certain situations. A consumer who needs delivery only “as soon as possible” may consider less expensive options, like USPS Priority Mail, which may take one to two days.

## Uniqueness of Brand Associations

The essence of brand positioning is that the brand has a sustainable competitive advantage or “unique selling proposition” that gives consumers a compelling reason why they should buy it.<sup>25</sup> Marketers can make this unique difference explicit through direct comparisons with competitors, or they may highlight it implicitly. They may base it on performance-related or non-performance-related attributes or benefits.

Although unique associations are critical to a brand’s success, unless the brand faces no competition, it will most likely share some associations with other brands. One function of shared associations is to establish category membership and define the scope of competition with other products and services.<sup>26</sup>

A product or service category can also share a set of associations that include specific beliefs about any member in the category, as well as overall attitudes toward all members in the category. These beliefs might include many of the relevant performance-related attributes for brands in the category, as well as more descriptive attributes that do not necessarily relate to product or service performance, like the color of a product, such as red for ketchup.

Consumers may consider certain attributes or benefits prototypical and essential to all brands in the category, and a specific brand an exemplar and most representative.<sup>27</sup> For example, they might expect a running shoe to provide support and comfort and to be built well enough to withstand repeated wearings, and they may believe that Asics, New Balance, or some other leading brand best represents a running shoe. Similarly, consumers might expect an online retailer to offer easy navigation, a variety of offerings, reasonable shipping options, secure purchase procedures, responsive customer service, and strict privacy guidelines, and they may consider L.L. Bean or some other market leader to be the best example of an online retailer.
