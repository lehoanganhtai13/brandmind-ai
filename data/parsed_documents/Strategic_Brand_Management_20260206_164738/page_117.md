**Brand History, Heritage, and Experiences.**  
Finally, brands may take on associations to their past and certain noteworthy events in the brand’s history. These types of associations may recall distinctly personal experiences and episodes or past behaviors and experiences of friends, family, or others. They can be highly personal and individual, or more well-known and shared by many people. For example, there may be associations to aspects of the brand’s marketing program, the color of the product or look of its package, the company or person that makes the product and the country in which it is made, the type of store in which it is sold, the events for which the brand is a sponsor, and the people who endorse the brand.

These types of associations can help create strong points-of-difference. In the midst of the recent major recession, Northern Trust used the fact that it was over 120 years old and had weathered many financial downturns through the years to reinforce trust and stability to its wealthy clientele.¹⁸ In any case, associations to history, heritage, and experiences draw upon more specific, concrete examples that transcend the generalizations that make up the usage imagery. In the extreme case, brands become iconic by combining all these types of associations into what is in effect a myth, tapping into enduring consumer hopes and dreams.¹⁹

**Summary.**  
A number of different types of associations related to either performance or imagery may become linked to the brand. We can characterize the brand associations making up the brand image and meaning according to three important dimensions—strength, favorability, and uniqueness—that provide the key to building brand equity. Successful results on these three dimensions produce the most positive brand responses, the underpinning of intense and active brand loyalty.
