Schmitt details five different types of marketing experiences that are becoming increasingly vital to consumers’ perceptions of brands:  
* *Sense marketing* appeals to consumers’ senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell).  
* *Feel marketing* appeals to customers’ inner feelings and emotions, ranging from mildly positive moods linked to a brand (e.g., for a noninvolving, nondurable grocery brand or service or industrial product) to strong emotions of joy and pride (e.g., for a consumer durable, technology, or social marketing campaign).  
* *Think marketing* appeals to the intellect in order to deliver cognitive, problem-solving experiences that engage customers creatively.  
* *Act marketing* targets physical behaviors, lifestyles, and interactions.  
* *Relate marketing* creates experiences by taking into account individuals’ desires to be part of a social context (e.g., to their self-esteem, being part of a subculture, or a brand community).  

He also describes how various “experience providers” (such as communications, visual/verbal identity and signage, product presence, co-branding, spatial environments, electronic media, and salespeople) can become part of a marketing campaign to create these experiences. In describing the increasingly more demanding consumer, Schmitt writes, “Customers want to be entertained, stimulated, emotionally affected and creatively challenged.”  

Figure 5-2 displays a scale developed by Schmitt and his colleagues to measure experiences and its dimensions. Their study respondents rated LEGO, Victoria’s Secret, iPod, and Starbucks as the most experiential brands.¹⁰  

Meyer and Schwager describe a customer experience management (CEM) process that involves monitoring three different patterns: past patterns (evaluating completed transactions), present patterns (tracking current relationships), and potential patterns (conducting inquiries in the hope of unveiling future opportunities).¹¹ The Science of Branding 5-1 describes how some marketers are thinking more carefully about one particularly interesting aspect of brand experiences—brand scents!

### Relationship Marketing.  
Marketing strategies must transcend the actual product or service to create stronger bonds with consumers and maximize brand resonance. This broader set of activities is sometimes called *relationship marketing* and is based on the premise that current customers are the key to long-term brand success.¹² Relationship marketing attempts to provide a more holistic, personalized brand experience to create stronger consumer ties. It expands both the depth and the breadth of brand-building marketing programs.

This table outlines four distinct dimensions of brand experience: Sensory, Affective, Behavioral, and Intellectual. The Sensory dimension focuses on a brand's ability to make a strong impression on visual or other senses, evoking interest through sensory appeal. The Affective dimension concerns the feelings and sentiments a brand induces, distinguishing between brands that elicit strong emotions and those that do not. The Behavioral dimension relates to physical actions and bodily experiences associated with using a brand, indicating whether a brand is action-oriented. Finally, the Intellectual dimension describes the extent to which a brand stimulates thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving, contrasting brands that engage the mind with those that do not. These dimensions collectively represent a framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of consumer-brand interactions.
