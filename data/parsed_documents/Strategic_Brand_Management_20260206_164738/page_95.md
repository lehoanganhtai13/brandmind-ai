It also provides memorable shorthand as to what are the crucial considerations of the brand that should be kept most salient and top-of-mind.

### Designing a Brand Mantra.

What makes a good brand mantra? Two high-profile and successful examples of brand mantras come from two powerful brands, Nike and Disney, as described in Branding Briefs 2-2 and 2-3. Brand mantras must economically communicate what the brand is and what it is *not*. The Nike and Disney examples show the power and utility of a well-designed brand mantra. They also help suggest what might characterize a good brand mantra. Both examples are essentially structured the same way, with three terms, as follows:

This table presents a comparative analysis of two brands, Nike and Disney, across three distinct categories: Emotional Modifier, Descriptive Modifier, and Brand Function. Nike is characterized by an "Authentic" emotional modifier, an "Athletic" descriptive modifier, and its primary brand function is "Performance." In contrast, Disney is associated with a "Fun" emotional modifier, a "Family" descriptive modifier, and its core brand function is "Entertainment." The structure highlights how different emotional and descriptive attributes contribute to the fundamental purpose and perceived identity of each brand.

## BRANDING BRIEF 2-2

### Nike Brand Mantra

A brand with a keen sense of what it represents to consumers is Nike. Nike has a rich set of associations with consumers, revolving around such considerations as its innovative product designs, its sponsorships of top athletes, its award-winning advertising, its competitive drive, and its irreverent attitude. Internally, Nike marketers adopted a three-word brand mantra of “authentic athletic performance” to guide their marketing efforts. Thus, in Nike’s eyes, its entire marketing program—its products and how they are sold—must reflect the key brand values conveyed by the brand mantra.

Nike’s brand mantra has had profound implications for its marketing. In the words of ex-Nike marketing gurus Scott Bedbury and Jerome Conlon, the brand mantra provided the “intellectual guard rails” to keep the brand moving in the right direction and to make sure it did not get off track somehow. Nike’s brand mantra has even affected product development. Over the years, Nike has expanded its brand meaning from “running shoes” to “athletic shoes” to “athletic shoes and apparel” to “all things associated with athletics (including equipment).”

Each step of the way, however, it has been guided by its “authentic athletic performance” brand mantra. For example, as Nike rolled out its successful apparel line, one important hurdle for the products was that they should be innovative enough through material, cut, or design to truly benefit top athletes. The revolutionary moisture-wicking technology of their Dri-Fit apparel line left athletes drier and more comfortable as they sweat. At the same time, the company has been careful to avoid using the Nike name to brand products that did not fit with the brand mantra, like casual “brown” shoes.

When Nike has experienced problems with its marketing program, they have often been a result of its failure to figure out how to translate its brand mantra to the marketing challenge at hand. For example, in going to Europe, Nike experienced several false starts until realizing that “authentic athletic performance” has a different meaning over there and, in particular, has to involve soccer in a major way. Similarly, Nike stumbled in developing its All Conditions Gear (ACG) outdoors shoes and clothing sub-brand, which attempted to translate its brand mantra into a less competitive arena.
