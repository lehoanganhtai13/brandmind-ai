With a more prominent corporate or family brand, however, feedback effects are probably more likely to be evident.

In some cases, the brand elements may not be explicitly linked at all. In a *brand endorsement strategy*, a brand element—often the corporate brand name or logo—appears on the package, signage, or product appearance in some way but is not directly included as part of the brand name. The brand endorsement strategy presumably establishes the maximum distance between the corporate or family brand and the individual brands, suggesting that it would yield the smallest transfer of brand associations to the new product but, at the same time, minimize the likelihood of any negative feedback effects.

For example, General Mills places its “Big G” logo on its cereal packages but retains distinct brand names such as Cheerios, Wheaties, and Lucky Charms. Kellogg, on the other hand, adopts a sub-brand strategy that combines the corporate name with individual cereal brands, for instance Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and Kellogg’s Special K. Through its sub-branding strategy and marketing activities, Kellogg should be more effective than General Mills in connecting its corporate name to its products and, as a result, in creating favorable associations to its corporate name.

### Branding Strategy Screen

Marketers can use the branding strategy screen displayed in Figure 11-7 to “dial up” or “dial down” different brand elements. If a potential new product or service is strongly related to the parent brand such that there is a high likelihood of parent brand equity carryover, and if there is little equity risk, a product descriptor or parent-brand-first sub-brand may make sense.<sup>28</sup>

On the other hand, if a potential new product or service is more removed from the parent brand such that there is a lower likelihood of parent brand equity carryover or if there is higher equity risk, then a parent-brand-second sub-brand or even a new brand may be more appropriate. In these latter cases, the parent brand may just be used as an endorser.

These pros and cons help determine whether a “branded house” or “house of brands” is the more appropriate strategy. What consumers know about and want from the brand, and how they will actually use it, is also important. Although offering multiple sub-brands as part of a detailed brand family may seem to provide more descriptive details, it can easily backfire if taken too far.

For example, when one-time technology hotshot Silicon Graphics named its new 3-D work station “Indigo<sup>2</sup> Solid Impact,” customers chose to simplify the name by calling it simply “Solid.” Creating equity for a low-level brand modifier (Solid) would certainly not be called good branding practice. Brand equity ideally resides at the highest level of the branding hierarchy possible, where it can benefit more products and services.

### Linking Brand Elements to Multiple Products

So far, we’ve highlighted how to apply different brand elements to a particular product—the “vertical” aspects of the brand hierarchy. Next, we consider how to link any one brand element to multiple products—the “horizontal” aspects. The *principle of commonality* states that the more common brand elements products share, the stronger the linkages between them.

This table outlines a brand strategy framework, differentiating between single parent brands and new brands, with sub-brands categorized by their relationship to the parent. The core distinction lies in the relevance and differentiating power of the parent brand's equity, influencing opportunities for positive feedback and the risk of negative feedback. A single parent brand with highly relevant and differentiating equity offers more positive feedback opportunities and minimal risk of negative association. Conversely, a single parent brand where equity is less relevant and differentiating presents fewer positive feedback avenues and a higher risk of negative feedback. The structure implies a strategic choice based on the parent brand's strength and its potential impact on sub-brands or new brand introductions.
