For a successful turnaround, brands sometimes have to return to their roots to recapture lost sources of equity. In other cases, the brand meaning has had to fundamentally change to recapture market leadership. Regardless of approach, brands on the comeback trail must make more “revolutionary” than “evolutionary” changes to reinforce brand meaning.

Often, the first place to look in turning around the fortunes of a brand is the original sources of brand equity. In profiling brand knowledge structures to guide repositioning, marketers need to accurately and completely characterize the breadth and depth of brand awareness; the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations and brand responses held in consumer memory; and the nature of consumer–brand relationships. A comprehensive brand equity measurement system as outlined in Chapter 8 should help reveal the current status of these sources of brand equity. If not, or to provide additional insight, a special brand audit may be necessary.

Of particular importance is the extent to which key brand associations are still adequately functioning as points-of-difference or points-of-parity to properly position the brand. Are positive associations losing their strength or uniqueness? Have negative associations become linked to the brand, for example, because of some change in the marketing environment?

Marketers must next decide whether to retain the same positioning or create a new one and, if the latter, which positioning to adopt. The positioning considerations outlined in Chapter 3 can provide useful insights as to the desirability, deliverability, and differentiability of different possible positions based on consumer, company, and competitive considerations.

Sometimes the positioning is still appropriate, but the marketing program is the source of the problem because it is failing to deliver on it. In these instances, a back-to-basics strategy may make sense. Branding Brief 13-3 describes how Harley-Davidson rode a back-to-basics strategy to icon status.
