### Increase Efficiency of Promotional Expenditures.  
Several research studies document this benefit. One study of 98 consumer brands in 11 markets found that successful brand extensions spent less on advertising than comparable new-name entries spent. Another comprehensive study found similar results, indicating that the average advertising-to-sales ratio for brand extensions was 10 percent, compared with 19 percent for new brands.

### Reduce Costs of Introductory and Follow-Up Marketing Programs.  
Because of these push and pull considerations in distribution and promotion, it has been estimated that a firm can save 40–80 percent on the estimated $30–$50 million it can cost to launch a new supermarket product nationally in the United States. Other efficiencies can result after the launch. For example, when a brand becomes associated with multiple products, advertising can be more cost-effective for the family brand as a whole.

### Avoid Cost of Developing a New Brand.  
Developing new brand elements is an art and a science. To conduct the necessary consumer research and employ skilled personnel to design high-quality brand names, logos, symbols, packages, characters, and slogans can be quite expensive, and there is no assurance of success. As the number of available—and appealing—brand names keeps shrinking, legal conflicts grow more likely. To avoid these, a global trademark search is a must for any major new brand launch or rebranding, and it can cost millions of dollars.

### Allow for Packaging and Labeling Efficiencies.  
Similar or identical packages and labels for extensions can result in lower production costs and, if coordinated properly, more prominence in the retail store where they can create a “billboard” effect. For example, Stouffer’s offers a variety of frozen entrees with identical orange packaging that increases their visibility when they are stocked together in the freezer. Coca-Cola soft drinks and Pepperidge Farm cookies achieve a similar effect.

### Permit Consumer Variety-Seeking.  
If marketers offer a portfolio of brand variants within a product category, consumers who need a change—because of boredom or satiation—can switch without having to leave the brand family. A complement of line extensions can also encourage customers to use the brand to a greater extent or in different ways. Even to compete effectively in some categories, marketers may need to have multiple items that together form a cohesive product line. A company that seems to offer something for everyone is L’Oréal.

## L’ORÉAL  
Concentrating solely on beauty and personal care since its founding in 1907, L’Oréal has become a global powerhouse through its extensive brand portfolio. The firm has products for virtually every channel, price point, and market. Garnier is its fast-growing mass brand. L’Oréal Paris is at the higher end of the mass range, combining sophisticated cosmetics at accessible price points. Lancôme is the premium luxury brand. L’Oréal adheres to a strict channel exclusivity strategy. Professional products (Matrix and Redken) are sold at hair salons, consumer product brands (Maybelline and Garnier) at retail stores, including drug stores and food stores, luxury products (Biotherm and Lancôme) at specialty stores or department stores, and active cosmetic brands (La Roche-Posay) at dispensing dermatologists and pharmacies. L’Oréal also owns two retail chain brands—Kiehl’s and the Body Shop. Geographically, the company casts a wide net. Many of its brands are sold in as many as 130 countries; Lancôme is sold in 160. Recently, L’Oréal has placed much importance on emerging markets, China and India in particular, and it aims to double its existing customer base of 1 billion customers worldwide by 2021. The firm invests heavily in research and development (earmarking approximately 3 percent of net sales) in the belief that science and technology and the quality of its products are the keys to success. Roughly 15–20 percent of the product lines turn over in any given year, due to product improvements or the launch of new products. The company’s first CMO, Marc Speichert, was hired from Colgate in part to orchestrate marketing.
