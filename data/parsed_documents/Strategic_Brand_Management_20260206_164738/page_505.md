3. Identify a fading brand. What suggestions can you offer to revitalize its brand equity? Try to apply the different approaches suggested in this chapter. Which strategies would seem to work best?  
4. Try to think of additional examples of brands that adopted either a back-to-basics or a reinvention revitalization strategy. How well did the strategies work?  
5. Choose a brand that has recently experienced a marketing crisis. How would you evaluate the marketers’ response? What did they do well? What did they not do well?

## Responding to a Brand Crisis

Tylenol has been a true marketing success story. Originally introduced by McNeil Laboratories as a liquid alternative to aspirin for children, Tylenol achieved nonprescription status when McNeil was bought by Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in 1959. J&J’s initial marketing plan promoted a tablet form of the product for physicians to prescribe as a substitute for aspirin when allergic reactions occurred. Tylenol consists of acetaminophen, a drug as effective as aspirin in the relief of pain and fever but without the stomach irritation that often accompanies aspirin use.

Backed by this selective physician push, sales for the brand grew slowly but steadily over the course of the next 15 years. By 1974, sales reached $50 million, or 10 percent of the analgesic market. In defending its turf from Bristol-Myers’s low-priced but heavily promoted entry Datril, J&J recognized the value of advertising Tylenol directly to consumers.

Thanks also to the successful introduction of a line extension, Extra-Strength Tylenol in tablet and capsule form, the brand’s market share had risen to 37 percent of the pain reliever market by 1982. As the largest single brand in the history of health and beauty aids, Tylenol was used by 100 million U.S. consumers. It contributed 8 percent to J&J’s sales but almost twice that percentage in net profits.

Advertising support for the brand was heavy. A $40 million media campaign for 1982 used two different messages. The “hospital campaign” employed testimonials from people who had been given Tylenol in the hospital and had grown to trust it. The ad concluded with the tag line, “Trust Tylenol—hospitals do.” The “hidden camera” campaign showed subjects who had been unobtrusively filmed while describing the symptoms of their headache, trying Extra-Strength Tylenol as a solution, and vowing to use it again based on its effectiveness. These ads concluded with the tag line, “Tylenol . . . the most potent pain reliever you can buy without a prescription.”

### The Tylenol Product Tampering Crisis

All this success came crashing to the ground in the first week of October 1982, with the news that seven people had died in the Chicago area after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that turned out to contain cyanide poison. Although it quickly became evident that the problem was restricted to that area of the country and had almost certainly been the work of some deranged person outside the company, consumer confidence was severely shaken.

Most marketing experts believed the damage to the brand’s reputation was irreparable and that Tylenol would never fully recover. Well-known advertising guru Jerry Della Femina was quoted in the *New York Times* as saying,  
> “On one day, every single human being in the country thought that Tylenol might kill them. I don’t think there are enough advertising dollars, enough marketing men, to change that. . . . You’ll not see the name Tylenol in any form within a year.”  

Tylenol’s comeback from these seemingly insurmountable odds has become a classic example of how best to handle a marketing crisis.

### The Tylenol Product Tampering Recovery

Within the first week of the crisis, J&J issued a worldwide alert to the medical community, set up a 24-hour toll-free telephone number, recalled and analyzed sample batches of the product, briefed the Food and Drug Administration, and offered a $100,000 reward to apprehend the culprit of the tampering. During the week of October 5, the company began a voluntary withdrawal of the brand by repurchasing 31 million bottles with a retail value of $100 million. It stopped advertising, and all communications with the public were in the form of press releases.

To monitor consumer response to the crisis, J&J started to conduct weekly tracking surveys with 1,000 consumer respondents. Ultimately, the company spent a total of $1.5 million for marketing research in the fourth quarter of 1982. The following week of October 12, it introduced a capsule exchange offer, promoted in half-page press announcements in 150 major markets across the country, that invited the public to mail in bottles of capsules and receive tablets in exchange. Although well intentioned, this offer met with poor consumer response.

During the week of October 24, J&J made its return to TV advertising with the goals of convincing Tylenol users they could continue to trust the safety of Tylenol products and encouraging the use of the tablet form until tamper-resistant packaging was available.
