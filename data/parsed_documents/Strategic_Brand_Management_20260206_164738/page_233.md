The main advantage of nontraditional media is that they can reach a very precise and captive audience in a cost-effective and increasingly engaging manner.

Because the audience must process out-of-home ads quickly, however, the message must be simple and direct. In fact, outdoor advertising is often called the “15-second sell.” In noting how out-of-home aligns with twenty-first century consumers, one commentator observed that with people on-the-go and wanting content in short bursts, “Billboards are the original tweets—you get a quick image or piece of knowledge than move on.”<sup>36</sup> In that regard, strategically, out-of-home advertising is often more effective at enhancing awareness or reinforcing existing brand associations than at creating new ones.

The challenge with nontraditional media is demonstrating their reach and effectiveness through credible, independent research. Another danger of nontraditional media is consumer backlash against overcommercialization. Perhaps because of the sheer pervasiveness of advertising, however, consumers seem to be less bothered by nontraditional media now than in the past.

Consumers must be favorably affected in some way to justify the marketing expenditures for nontraditional media, and some firms offering ad placement in supermarket checkout lines, fast-food restaurants, physicians’ waiting rooms, health clubs, and truck stops have suspended business at least in part because of lack of consumer interest. The bottom line, however, is that there will always be room for creative means of placing the brand in front of consumers—the possibilities are endless.

### Promotion

Although they do very different things, advertising and promotion often go hand-in-hand. *Sales promotions* are short-term incentives to encourage trial or usage of a product or service.<sup>37</sup> Marketers can target sales promotions to either the trade or end consumers. Like advertising, sales promotions come in all forms. Whereas advertising typically provides consumers a *reason* to buy, sales promotions offer consumers an *incentive* to buy. Thus, sales promotions are designed to do the following:

* Change the behavior of the trade so that they carry the brand and actively support it
* Change the behavior of consumers so that they buy a brand for the first time, buy more of the brand, or buy the brand earlier or more often

Analysts maintain that the use of sales promotions grew in the 1980s and 1990s for a number of reasons. Brand management systems with quarterly evaluations were thought to encourage short-term solutions, and an increased need for accountability seemed to favor communication tools like promotions, whose behavioral effects are more quickly and easily observed than the often “softer” perceptual effects of advertising. Economic forces worked against advertising effectiveness as ad rates rose steadily despite what marketers saw as an increasingly cluttered media environment and fragmented audience. Consumers were thought to be making more in-store decisions, and to be less brand loyal and more immune to advertising than in the past. Many mature brands were less easily differentiated. On top of it all, retailers became more powerful.

For all these reasons, some marketers began to see consumer and trade promotions as a more effective means than advertising to influence the sales of a brand. There clearly are advantages to sales promotions. Consumer sales promotions permit manufacturers to price discriminate by effectively charging different prices to groups of consumers who vary in their price sensitivity. Besides conveying a sense of urgency to consumers, carefully designed promotions can build brand equity through information or actual product experience that helps to create strong, favorable, and unique associations. Sales promotions can encourage the trade to maintain full stocks and actively support the manufacturer’s merchandising efforts.

On the other hand, from a consumer behavior perspective, there are a number of disadvantages of sales promotions, such as decreased brand loyalty and increased brand switching, decreased quality perceptions, and increased price sensitivity. Besides inhibiting the use of franchise-building advertising or other communications, diverting marketing funds into coupons or other sales promotion sometimes has led to reductions in research and development budgets and staff. Perhaps most importantly, the widespread discounting arising from trade promotions may have led to the increased importance of price as a factor in consumer decisions, breaking down traditional brand loyalty patterns.

Another disadvantage of sales promotions is that in some cases they may merely subsidize buyers who would have bought the brand anyway. Interestingly, the more affluent, educated, suburban, and ethnically Caucasian a household is, the more likely it is to use coupons, mainly because moneywise MOMS.com.
