products, consumers might develop stronger brand associations to “modern designs” and “environmentally friendliness.”

In this categorization perspective, if consumers saw a brand extension as closely related or similar to the brand category, they could easily transfer their existing attitude about the parent brand to the extension. If they were not as sure about the similarity, they might evaluate the extension in a more detailed, piecemeal fashion. In this case, the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of salient brand associations would determine how they viewed the extension.<sup>59</sup>

Thus, a categorization view considers consumers’ evaluations of brand extensions to be a two-step process. First, consumers determine whether there is a match between what they know about the parent brand and what they believe to be true about the extension. Then, if the match is good, consumers might transfer their existing brand attitudes to the extension.

Consistent with these notions, Aaker and Keller collected consumer reactions to 20 proposed extensions from six well-known brands and found that both a perception of fit between the original and extension product categories and a perception of high quality for the parent brand led to more favorable extension evaluations.<sup>60</sup>

A number of subsequent studies have explored the generalizability of these findings to markets outside the United States. Based on a comprehensive analysis of 131 brand extensions from seven such replication studies around the world, Bottomly and Holden concluded that this basic model clearly generalized, although cross-cultural differences influenced the relative importance attached to the model components.<sup>61</sup>

Thus, in general, brand extensions are more likely to be favorably evaluated by consumers if they see some bases of fit or congruity between the proposed extension and parent brand.<sup>62</sup> A lack of perceived fit may doom a potentially successful brand extension. Interestingly, moderately incongruent extensions can evoke more favorable extension evaluations than highly congruent extensions under certain specialized situations, such as when consumers are highly involved and the extension is otherwise undifferentiated from competitors.<sup>63</sup>

2. **There are many bases of fit: both product-related and non-product-related attributes and benefits may influence extension fit.** Any association about the parent brand that consumers hold in memory may serve as a potential basis of fit. Most academic researchers assume consumers’ judgments of similarity are a function of salient shared associations between the parent brand and the extension product category. Specifically, the more common and the fewer distinctive associations that exist, the greater the perception of overall similarity, whether based on product- or non-product-related attributes and benefits.<sup>64</sup> Consumers may also use attributes for a prototypical brand or a particular exemplar as the standard of reference for the extension category and form their perceptions of fit with the parent brand on that basis.

To demonstrate how fit does not have to be based on product-related associations alone, Park, Milberg, and Lawson have distinguished between fit based on “product-feature similarity” (as described earlier) and “brand-concept consistency.”<sup>65</sup> They define *brand concepts* as the brand-unique image associations that arise from a particular combination of attributes, benefits, and the marketing efforts used to translate these attributes into higher-order meanings (such as high status). **Brand-concept consistency** measures how well the brand concept accommodates the extension product. The important point these researchers make is that different types of brand concepts from the same original product category may extend into the same category with varying degrees of success, even when product-feature similarity is high.

Park and his coauthors further distinguish between *function-oriented brands*, whose dominant associations relate to product performance (like Timex watches), and *prestige-oriented brands*, whose dominant associations relate to consumers’ expression of self-concepts or images (like Rolex watches). Experimentally, they showed that the Rolex brand could more easily extend into categories such as grandfather clocks, bracelets, and rings than the Timex brand; however, Timex could more easily extend into categories such as stopwatches, batteries, and calculators. In the former case, high brand-concept consistency for Rolex overcame a lack of product-feature similarity; in the latter case, product-feature similarity favored a function-oriented brand such as Timex.
