Moreover, if less than perfect overlap exists—which is almost always the case—marketers can design a communication option to reflect the fact that consumers may or may not have seen other communication options, as suggested by the fifth criterion, conformability. Finally, all of these considerations must be offset by their cost, as suggested by the sixth criterion.

**Contribution.** Contribution is the inherent ability of a marketing communication to create the desired response and communication effects from consumers *in the absence of exposure to any other communication option.* In other words, contribution describes the main effects of a marketing communication option in terms of how it affects consumers’ processing of a communication and the resulting outcomes. As we noted earlier, marketing communications can play many different roles, like building awareness, enhancing image, eliciting responses, and inducing sales, and the contribution of any marketing communication option will depend on how well it plays that role. Also as we noted earlier, much prior research has considered this aspect of communications, generating conceptual guidelines and evaluation criteria in the process. Given that overlap with communication options exists, however, marketers must consider other factors, as follows.

**Commonality.** Regardless of which communication options marketers choose, they should coordinate the entire marketing communication program to create a consistent and cohesive brand image in which brand associations share content and meaning. The consistency and cohesiveness of the brand image is important because the image determines how easily consumers can recall existing associations and responses and how easily they can link additional associations and responses to the brand in memory.

Commonality is the extent to which *common* information conveyed by different communication options shares meaning across communication options. Most definitions of IMC emphasize only this criterion. For example, Burnett and Moriarty define integrated marketing communications as the “practice of unifying all marketing communication tools—from advertising to packaging—to send target audiences a consistent, persuasive message that promotes company goals.”[^88]

In general, we learn and recall information that is consistent in meaning more easily than unrelated information—though the unexpectedness of inconsistent information sometimes can lead to more elaborate processing and stronger associations than consistent information.[^89] Nevertheless, with inconsistent associations and a diffuse brand image, consumers may overlook some associations or, because they are confused about the meaning of the brand, form less strong and less favorable new associations.

Therefore, in the long run, marketers should design different communication elements and combine them so that they work effectively together to create a consistent and cohesive brand image. The more abstract the association to be created or reinforced by marketing communications, the more likely it would seem that we could effectively reinforce it in different ways across heterogeneous communication options.[^90]

For example, if the association we desire is “contemporary,” then there may be a number of different ways we can make a brand seem modern and relevant. On the other hand, if our desired association is a concrete attribute, say, “rich chocolate taste,” then it may be difficult to convey it in communication options that do not permit explicit product statements, such as sponsorship.

Take Heineken. The brand seeks to achieve a strong premium image and positioning in its communications. Heineken’s “Walk-In Fridge” campaign started as a video and then a TV ad that first showed a group of girlfriends jumping up and down and shrieking with joy when one of them gets a walk-in wardrobe closet, followed by a group of guys equally ecstatic over a walk-in refrigerator lined with Heineken. Heineken next placed gigantic cardboard boxes labeled “Walk-In Fridge” all over Amsterdam as if put out in the trash. Finally, Heineken placed real walk-in fridges at various beer festivals, allowing groups of friends to mimic the ad and video and upload their own video to YouTube.[^91]

Finally, another commonality issue is the extent of executional consistency across communication options—that is, the extent to which we convey non-product-related information in different communication options. The more coordinated executional information is, the more likely it is that this information can serve as a retrieval cue to other communication effects.[^92] In other words, if a symbol is established in one communication option, like a feather in a TV ad for a deodorant to convey mildness and softness, then marketers can use it in other communications to help trigger the knowledge, thoughts, feelings, and images stored in memory from exposure to a previous communication.
