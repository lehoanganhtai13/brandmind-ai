# Principle of Prominence

Prominence depends on several factors, such as order, size, and appearance, as well as semantic associations. A name is generally more prominent when it appears first, is larger, and looks more distinctive. Assume PepsiCo has adopted a sub-branding strategy to introduce a new vitamin-fortified cola, combining its corporate family brand name with a new individual brand name, say, “Vitacola.” We could make the Pepsi name more prominent by placing it first and making it bigger: **PEPSI** *Vitacola*. Or we could make the individual brand more prominent by placing it first and making it bigger: *Vitacola* **BY PEPSI**.

The *principle of prominence* states that the relative prominence of the brand elements determines which become the primary one(s) and which the secondary one(s). Primary brand elements should convey the main product positioning and points-of-difference. Secondary brand elements convey a more restricted set of supporting associations such as points-of-parity or perhaps an additional point-of-difference. A secondary brand element may also facilitate awareness.

For example, with the Droid by Motorola series of smartphones, the primary brand element is the Droid name, which connotes its use of Google’s Android operating system. The Motorola name, on the other hand, is a secondary brand element that ideally conveys credibility, quality, and professionalism. According to the principle of prominence, the more prominent a brand element, the more emphasis consumers will give it in forming their brand opinions. The relative prominence of the individual and the corporate brands will therefore affect perceptions of product distance and the type of image created for a new product.

Consumers are very literal. If the corporate or family brand is made more prominent, then its associations are more likely to dominate. If the individual brand is made more prominent, on the other hand, then it should be easier to create a more distinctive brand image. “Marriott’s Courtyard” would be seen as much more of a Marriott hotel than “Courtyard by Marriott” by virtue of having the corporate name first. In “Courtyard by Marriott,” the position of the corporate or family brand is signaling to consumers that the new product is not as closely related to its other products that share that name. As a result, consumers should be less likely to transfer corporate or family brand associations. At the same time, because of the greater perceived distance, the success or failure of the new product should be less likely to affect the image of the corporate
