Combined, the brand function term and descriptive modifier help delineate the brand boundaries. Finally, the *emotional modifier* provides another qualifier—how exactly does the brand provide benefits and in what ways?

Brand mantras don’t necessarily have to follow this exact structure, but they should clearly delineate what the brand is supposed to represent and therefore, at least implicitly, what it is not. Several additional points are worth noting.

1. Brand mantras derive their power and usefulness from their collective meaning. Other brands may be strong on one, or perhaps even a few, of the brand associations making up the brand mantra. For the brand mantra to be effective, no other brand should singularly excel on all dimensions. Part of the key to both Nike’s and Disney’s success is that for years, no other competitor could really deliver on the promise suggested by their brand mantras as well as they did.  
2. Brand mantras typically are designed to capture the brand’s points-of-difference, that is, what is unique about the brand. Other aspects of the brand positioning—especially the brand’s points-of-parity—may also be important and may need to be reinforced in other ways.  
3. For brands facing rapid growth, a brand functions term can provide critical guidance as to appropriate and inappropriate categories into which to extend. For brands in more stable categories, the brand mantra may focus more on points-of-difference as expressed by the functional and emotional modifiers, perhaps not even including a brand functions term.

### Implementing a Brand Mantra.

Brand mantras should be developed at the same time as the brand positioning. As we’ve seen, brand positioning typically is a result of an in-depth examination of the brand through some form of brand audit or other activities. Brand mantras may benefit from the learning gained from those activities but, at the same time, require more internal examination and involve input from a wider range of company employees and marketing staff. Part of this internal exercise is actually to determine the different means by which each and every employee currently affects brand equity, and how he or she can contribute in a positive way to a brand’s destiny. The importance of internal branding is reinforced in *The Science of Branding* 2-2.

Marketers can often summarize the brand positioning in a few sentences or a short paragraph that suggests the ideal core brand associations consumers should hold. Based on these core brand associations, a brainstorming session can attempt to identify PODs, POPs, and different brand mantra candidates. In the final brand mantra, the following considerations should come into play:

* *Communicate:* A good brand mantra should both define the category (or categories) of the business to set the brand boundaries and clarify what is unique about the brand.  
* *Simplify:* An effective brand mantra should be memorable. That means it should be short, crisp, and vivid. A three-word mantra is ideal because it is the most economical way to convey the brand positioning.  
* *Inspire:* Ideally, the brand mantra should also stake out ground that is personally meaningful and relevant to as many employees as possible. Brand mantras can do more than inform and guide; they can also inspire, if the brand values tap into higher-level meaning with employees as well as consumers.

Regardless of how many words make up the mantra, however, *there will always be a level of meaning beneath the brand mantra itself that will need to be articulated.* Virtually any word may have many interpretations. For example, the words *fun*, *family*, and *entertainment* in Disney’s brand mantra can each take on multiple meanings, leading Disney to drill deeper to provide a stronger foundation for the mantra. Two or three short phrases were therefore added later to clarify each of the three words.
