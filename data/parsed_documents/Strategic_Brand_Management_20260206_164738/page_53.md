# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 1-3  *(continued)*

> Tellis and Golder identify the following five factors and rationale as the keys to enduring brand leadership.

**Vision of the Mass Market**  
Companies with a keen eye for mass market tastes are more likely to build a broad and sustainable customer base. Although Pampers was not the market leader in the disposable diaper category during its first several years, it spent significantly on research and development in order to design an affordable and effective disposable diaper. Pampers quickly became the market leader.

**Managerial Persistence**  
The “breakthrough” technology that can drive market leadership often requires the commitment of company resources over long periods of time. For example, JVC spent 21 years researching the VHS video recorder before launching it in 1976 and becoming a market leader.

**Financial Commitment**  
The cost of maintaining leadership is high because of the demands for research and development and marketing. Companies that aim for short-term profitability rather than long-term leadership, as Rheingold Brewery did when it curtailed support of its Gablinger’s light beer a year after the 1967 introduction of the product, are unlikely to enjoy enduring leadership.

**Relentless Innovation**  
Due to changes in consumer tastes and competition from other firms, companies that wish to maintain leadership positions must continually innovate. Gillette, both a long-term leader and historically an innovator, typically has at least 20 shaving products on the drawing board at any given time.

**Asset Leverage**  
Companies can become leaders in some categories if they hold a leadership position in a related category. For instance, Coca-Cola leveraged its success and experience with cola (Coke) and diet cola (Tab) to introduce Diet Coke in 1982. Within one year of its introduction, Diet Coke became the market leader.

This figure, "Factors Determining Enduring Leadership," presents a framework for understanding what contributes to a company's long-term market dominance. It identifies key determinants that foster enduring leadership, drawing on research by Tellis and Golder. The structure implies a causal relationship where specific factors lead to the outcome of enduring leadership. While the table itself does not detail these factors, it serves as an introduction to a more comprehensive diagram or discussion that would elaborate on the elements contributing to sustained market success, likely exploring strategic, operational, or market-related influences. The source indicates the figure is based on academic research published in the MIT Sloan Management Review.

## BRANDING CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

Although brands may be as important as ever to consumers, in reality *brand management may be more difficult than ever.* Let’s look at some recent developments that have significantly complicated marketing practices and pose challenges for brand managers (see Figure 1-9).<sup>32</sup>

### Savvy Customers

Increasingly, consumers and businesses have become more experienced with marketing, more knowledgeable about how it works, and more demanding. A well-developed media market pays increased attention to companies’ marketing actions and motivations. Consumer information and support exists in the form of consumer guides (*Consumer Reports*), Web sites (Epinions.com), influential blogs, and so on.
