# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 3-1

## Luxury Branding

A number of characteristics define luxury branding and suggest strategic and tactical guidelines. Here are some of those guidelines, each of which merits further thought and discussion.

* Maintaining a premium, prestige image with luxury branding is crucial; controlling that image is thus a priority. Ideally the image will be designed to be globally relevant.
* Luxury branding often relies on an aspirational image that benefits from a “trickle-down” effect to a broader audience via PR and word-of-mouth, but there must be a good balance between accessibility and exclusivity.
* Marketers of luxury brands must control all aspects of the marketing program to ensure quality products and services and pleasurable purchase and consumption experiences.
* Distribution for luxury brands should be carefully controlled via a selective distribution strategy that may include company stores.
* Luxury brands are enhanced by a premium pricing strategy with strong quality cues and few discounts or markdowns.
* Brand architecture for luxury brands must be managed very carefully with only selective, strategic licensing and extensions (especially vertically). Brand hierarchies and portfolios must be employed, with appropriate sub-brands to minimize cannibalization and optimize equity flows.
* Luxury brands can sometimes benefit from secondary associations with linked personalities, events, countries, and so on.
* Brand elements besides brand names—such as logos and packaging—can be important drivers of brand equity for luxury brands.
* Competition may need to be defined broadly, because luxury brands can compete with luxury brands from other categories for discretionary consumer dollars.
* Luxury brands must legally protect all trademarks and aggressively combat counterfeits.

brand user on descriptive demographic factors or more abstract psychographic factors. Demographic factors might include the following:

* **Gender.** Venus razors and Secret deodorant have “feminine” associations, whereas Gillette razors and Axe deodorant have more “masculine” associations.<sup>8</sup>
* **Age.** Pepsi Cola, Powerade energy sports drink, and Under Armour performance clothing, shoes and accessories have positioned themselves as fresher and younger in spirit than Coke, Gatorade, and Nike, respectively.
* **Race.** Goya foods and the Univision television network have a strong identification with the Hispanic market.
* **Income.** Sperry Topsider shoes, Polo shirts, and BMW automobiles became associated with “yuppies”—young, affluent, urban professionals.

Psychographic factors might include attitudes toward life, careers, possessions, social issues, or political institutions; for example, a brand user might be seen as iconoclastic or as more traditional and conservative.

In a business-to-business setting, user imagery might relate to the size or type of organization. For example, buyers might see Microsoft as an “aggressive” company and L. L. Bean as a “caring” company. User imagery may focus on more than characteristics of just one type of individual and center on broader issues in terms of perceptions of a group as a whole. For example, customers may believe that a brand is used by many people and therefore view the brand as “popular” or a “market leader.”

### Purchase and Usage Imagery.

A second set of associations tells consumers under what conditions or situations they can or should buy and use the brand. Associations can relate to type of channel, such as department stores, specialty stores, or the Internet; to specific stores such as Macy’s, Foot Locker, or Bluefly; and to ease of purchase and associated rewards (if any).
