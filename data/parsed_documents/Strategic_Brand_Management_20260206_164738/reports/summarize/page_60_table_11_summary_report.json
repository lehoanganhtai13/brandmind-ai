  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a four-step process for managing brand equity. The initial step, \"Identify and Establish Brand Positioning and Values,\" involves defining the competitive frame of reference, points-of-parity and difference, core brand associations, and brand mantra, often informed by mental maps. The second step, \"Plan and Implement Brand Marketing Programs,\" focuses on the strategic mixing and matching of brand elements, integrating marketing activities, and leveraging secondary associations. Following this, \"Measure and Interpret Brand Performance\" utilizes tools such as the brand value chain, brand audits, brand tracking, and a brand equity management system. The final step, \"Grow and Sustain Brand Equity,\" encompasses establishing brand architecture, managing brand portfolios and hierarchies, implementing brand expansion strategies, and employing brand reinforcement and revitalization techniques. This structured approach moves from foundational positioning to ongoing growth and maintenance of brand equity.",
