  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines the distinct roles and functions of branding from the perspectives of both consumers and manufacturers. For consumers, branding serves as a tool for identifying product origins, assigning responsibility to the maker, and reducing perceived risk and search costs. It acts as a promise or pact with the manufacturer and functions as a symbolic device, ultimately signaling product quality. From the manufacturer's viewpoint, branding is a means of identification for handling and tracing, and a method for legally protecting unique features. It signals quality levels to customers, endows products with unique associations, provides a source of competitive advantage, and ultimately generates financial returns. The structure is comparative, highlighting the dual nature of branding as a strategic tool for businesses and a functional aid for consumers.",
