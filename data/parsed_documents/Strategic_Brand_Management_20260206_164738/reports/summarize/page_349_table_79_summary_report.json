  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines six dimensions of brand engagement, each framed by a key question and a description of the corresponding value. The dimensions are: Conversation, focusing on user recognition and buzz generation; Advocacy, measuring how many users actively promote the brand; Information, assessing the perceived value of information exchange among customers; Affiliation, exploring the sense of community created by the brand; Utility, evaluating the value consumers derive from social interaction related to the brand; and Identity, examining how users identify with others through brand usage. Collectively, these dimensions describe a spectrum of customer interaction and connection with a brand, ranging from passive recognition and information exchange to active advocacy and the formation of community and identity.",
