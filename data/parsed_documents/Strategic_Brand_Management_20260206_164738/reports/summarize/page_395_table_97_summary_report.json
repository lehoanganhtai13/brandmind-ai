  "summary_markdown": "Figure 11-3 outlines nine potential special roles that brands can fulfill within a firm's overall brand portfolio. These roles are categorized by their strategic objectives, including market penetration and segment coverage, such as attracting specific market segments not currently served or acting as a low-end entry-level product to draw in new customers. The figure also highlights defensive and supportive functions, like serving as a flanker to protect flagship brands or increasing shelf presence and retailer dependence. Furthermore, it details roles focused on financial and operational efficiency, such as acting as a cash cow for profit generation or yielding economies of scale in various business functions. Finally, some roles are geared towards enhancing brand perception and internal dynamics, including serving as a high-end prestige product to bolster the portfolio's credibility and increasing internal competition to drive performance.",
