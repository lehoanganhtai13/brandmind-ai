  "summary_markdown": "Figure 15-6 illustrates a framework for managing customer-based brand equity, emphasizing a hierarchical structure. The foundation is built upon four key components: **Brand Identity**, **Brand Meaning**, **Brand Responses**, and **Brand Relationships**. Brand Identity, at the base, encompasses the brand's comprehensive meaning and point of difference. Building upon this, Brand Meaning is developed through a combination of brand performance and imagery. These two foundational elements then influence Brand Responses, which are categorized into brand judgments and brand feelings. Finally, at the apex of the pyramid, Brand Relationships are formed, characterized by various levels of brand loyalty and the extent of the customer-brand connection. This structure highlights how a strong brand identity and meaning are essential for eliciting positive customer responses, ultimately leading to robust and loyal brand relationships.",
