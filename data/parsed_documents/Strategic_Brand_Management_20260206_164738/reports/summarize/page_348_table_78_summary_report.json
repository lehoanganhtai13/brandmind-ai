  "summary_markdown": "Figure 9-9 presents a Brand Engagement Scale, developed to measure the importance of brand engagement on market behavior. The scale comprises eight statements designed to capture the depth of a consumer's connection with their preferred brands. These statements explore the concept of a \"special bond\" and \"personal connection\" with brands, suggesting that consumers may consider their favorite brands to be an integral part of their identity, defining aspects of themselves and indicating who they are. The scale's structure implies a hierarchical or multi-faceted approach to understanding brand engagement, moving from a general sense of connection to a more profound identification and self-definition through brands.",
