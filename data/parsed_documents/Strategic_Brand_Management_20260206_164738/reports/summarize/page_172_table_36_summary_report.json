  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of different branding elements—Brand Names and URLs, Logos and Symbols, Characters, Slogans and Jingles, and Packaging and Signage—across six criteria: Memorability, Meaningfulness, Likability, Transferability, Adaptability, and Protectability. The structure is comparative, evaluating each branding element's strengths and weaknesses against these criteria. Brand Names and Slogans excel in Memorability and Meaningfulness, capable of enhancing recall and conveying explicit associations. Logos and Characters are strong in recognition and protectability, with Characters particularly adept at generating human qualities. Packaging and Signage offer good transferability and adaptability, often combining visual and verbal appeal. However, Brand Names and Characters face limitations in transferability and adaptability, while Packaging and Signage are more susceptible to copying. Overall, the table highlights the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each branding component in building a strong brand identity.",
