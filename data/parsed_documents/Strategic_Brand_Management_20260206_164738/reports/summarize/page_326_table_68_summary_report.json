  "summary_markdown": "This figure outlines a model for understanding consumer behavior, presented as a cyclical process. It begins with the identification of **Needs**, which triggers **Motives**. These motives then influence the consumer's **Perception** of available **Information**. This information is processed, leading to **Learning** and the formation of **Attitudes**. Attitudes, in turn, guide the consumer's **Decision Process**, which culminates in **Purchase Behavior**. Following the purchase, the consumer engages in **Post-purchase Evaluation**, which feeds back into their future needs and perceptions, thus completing the cycle and influencing subsequent behaviors. The model emphasizes the interconnectedness of these stages in shaping how consumers make choices.",
