  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of successful and unsuccessful category extensions, illustrating how established brands have leveraged their equity in different ways. Successful extensions, such as Dove shampoo and conditioner, Vaseline Intensive Care skin lotion, and Hershey chocolate milk, demonstrate a strong alignment between the parent brand's core attributes and the new product category, often reinforcing existing brand perceptions of care, quality, or indulgence. Similarly, Visa traveler's checks and Arm and Hammer toothpaste highlight successful extensions into related functional areas. In contrast, unsuccessful extensions, including Campbell’s tomato sauce, LifeSavers chewing gum, and Harley-Davidson wine coolers, suggest a disconnect or dilution of the parent brand's identity, where the new product category does not resonate with the established brand image or perceived expertise. Examples like Ben-Gay aspirin and Kleenex diapers further underscore the risks of extending into unrelated or inappropriate product domains, potentially damaging brand equity.",
