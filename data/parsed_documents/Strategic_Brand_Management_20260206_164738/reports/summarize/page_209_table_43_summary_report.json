  "summary_markdown": "This figure presents a customer channel value analysis for JCPenney, illustrating the cumulative value generated by customers interacting through various combinations of channels: Internet, Retail, and Catalog. The analysis shows a clear progression in customer value as more channels are utilized. Customers engaging solely through the Internet contribute $157 in value. This value increases to $195 for Retail-only customers and $201 for Catalog-only customers. Combining channels significantly boosts value: Internet + Catalog customers generate $446, while Internet + Retail customers contribute $485. The highest value is observed with the integration of multiple channels, with Catalog + Retail customers reaching $608 and those utilizing all three channels – Catalog + Retail + Internet – achieving the maximum value of $887. This data highlights a hierarchical structure where multi-channel engagement leads to progressively higher customer value.",
