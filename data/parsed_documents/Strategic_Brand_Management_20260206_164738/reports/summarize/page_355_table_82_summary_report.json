  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines four key components of brand equity and their associated outcomes. Energized Differentiation, defined as a brand's unique meaning with motion and direction, relates to margins and cultural currency. Relevance, representing how appropriate a brand is to a consumer, is linked to consideration and trial. Esteem, reflecting how a consumer regards a brand, is associated with loyalty. Finally, Knowledge, an intimate understanding of the brand, relates to brand saliency. The structure suggests a framework where distinct brand attributes drive specific consumer behaviors and perceptions, ultimately contributing to overall brand strength.",
