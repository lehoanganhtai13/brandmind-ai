  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a framework for understanding value creation, structured across four key stages: Marketing Program Investment, Customer Mind-Set, Market Performance, and Shareholder Value. The Marketing Program Investment stage encompasses various components such as Product, Communications, Trade, Employee, and Other investments. These investments influence the Customer Mind-Set, which is characterized by Awareness, Associations, Attitudes, Attachment, and Activity. The resulting Market Performance is measured by metrics including Price premiums, Price elasticities, Market share, Expansion success, Cost structure, and Profitability. Ultimately, these factors contribute to Shareholder Value, reflected in Stock price, P/E ratio, and Market capitalization. Interacting with these stages are \"Multipliers\": Program Quality Multiplier (Distinctiveness, Relevance, Integrated, Value, Excellence), Marketplace Conditions Multiplier (Competitive reactions, Channel support, Customer size and profile), and Investor Sentiment Multiplier (Market dynamics, Growth potential, Risk profile, Brand contribution), which modulate the effectiveness of the investments and the translation of performance into value.",
