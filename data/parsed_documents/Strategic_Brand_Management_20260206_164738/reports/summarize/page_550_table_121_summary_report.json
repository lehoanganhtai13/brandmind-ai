  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines key dimensions of brand knowledge, structured around two primary aspects: brand awareness and brand associations. Brand awareness is characterized by its depth, measured by the ease of brand recognition and recall, and its breadth, determined by the variety of purchase and consumption situations where the brand is considered. Brand associations are further categorized by their strength, favorability, and uniqueness. Strong associations are built through consistent marketing efforts that effectively communicate relevant information. Favorable associations arise when marketing programs deliver desired product-related and non-product-related benefits. Unique brand associations, when strong and favorable, serve as points of difference, distinguishing the brand from competitors, while non-unique associations can establish points of parity, fulfilling category requirements or counteracting competitor advantages.",
