  "summary_markdown": "This data outlines a hierarchical distribution strategy for various fashion brands, correlating specific brands with their respective distribution channels and price ranges. The structure moves from high-end to mass-market channels, with \"Collection stores\" at the apex, featuring premium brands like \"Calvin Klein Collection,\" \"ck Calvin Klein,\" and \"BCBG Max Azria.\" As the channels descend through \"Specialty stores\" (e.g., \"Sean John,\" \"Kenneth Cole New York\") and various tiers of department stores (\"Premier department stores,\" \"Department stores,\" \"Mid-tier department stores\"), the brand offerings become more accessible, including names like \"Calvin Klein,\" \"MICHAEL Michael Kors,\" \"BCBG Attitude,\" \"Kenneth Cole Reaction,\" \"Geoffrey Beene,\" \"IZOD,\" and \"Bass.\" The strategy culminates in \"Company stores\" and \"Discount stores,\" which carry brands such as \"Chaps,\" \"Van Heusen,\" and \"Arrow.\" A consistent, broad price range, from $10,000 down to $10, spans all these distribution levels, indicating a wide spectrum of product pricing across the entire brand portfolio and its market reach.",
