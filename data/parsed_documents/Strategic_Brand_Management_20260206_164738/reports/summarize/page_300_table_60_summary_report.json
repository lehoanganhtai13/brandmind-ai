  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of \"Reality\" versus \"Objective\" states, centered around the concept of \"Brand Equity.\" In the current \"Reality,\" customers are \"Owned,\" implying a transactional or captive relationship, while competition is \"Claimed,\" suggesting a focus on asserting market position. The \"Objective\" future state, however, envisions a shift towards customers being \"Valued,\" indicating a move towards customer-centricity and relationship building. Concurrently, competition is to be \"Desired,\" signifying a strategic aspiration to be the preferred choice in the market. This framework outlines a progression from a present, possession-based approach to a future, relationship-driven strategy aimed at enhancing Brand Equity.",
