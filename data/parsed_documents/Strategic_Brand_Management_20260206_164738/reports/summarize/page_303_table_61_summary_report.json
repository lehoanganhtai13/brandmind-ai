  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative structure, juxtaposing desirable product attributes with potential psychological benefits. On one side, it lists tangible features such as a \"stylish and attractive look and design\" and \"high-quality food.\" These attributes are directly linked to intangible, internal motivations on the other side, specifically \"Social approval?\" and \"Self-respect?\". The implied relationship is that possessing products with these desirable characteristics can lead to or fulfill these psychological needs, suggesting a model where product features serve as a means to achieve social validation and enhance one's sense of self-worth.",
