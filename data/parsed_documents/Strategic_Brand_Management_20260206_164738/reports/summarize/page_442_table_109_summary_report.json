  "summary_markdown": "Figure 12-4 outlines the potential disadvantages associated with brand extension. These drawbacks can manifest in several ways, including consumer confusion or frustration, and retailer resistance. Furthermore, brand extensions carry the risk of failure, which can negatively impact the parent brand's image. Even successful extensions can lead to unintended consequences such as cannibalizing sales of the parent brand, diminishing the brand's identification with a specific category, or diluting the overall brand meaning. Finally, pursuing brand extensions might cause a company to miss opportunities for developing entirely new brands.",
