  "summary_markdown": "This figure, \"Factors Determining Enduring Leadership,\" presents a framework for understanding what contributes to a company's long-term market dominance. It identifies key determinants that foster enduring leadership, drawing on research by Tellis and Golder. The structure implies a causal relationship where specific factors lead to the outcome of enduring leadership. While the table itself does not detail these factors, it serves as an introduction to a more comprehensive diagram or discussion that would elaborate on the elements contributing to sustained market success, likely exploring strategic, operational, or market-related influences. The source indicates the figure is based on academic research published in the MIT Sloan Management Review.",
