  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a hierarchical geographic structure, beginning with the broadest category, International, which encompasses all global operations. Nested beneath this is the Regional level, indicating a subdivision of international scope into more localized areas. The table implicitly suggests that activities or entities are organized first on a worldwide scale and then further delineated into distinct geographic regions for management, operational, or analytical purposes. This structure facilitates understanding the scope and scale of operations, moving from a global perspective down to specific territorial divisions.",
