  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a hierarchical scale rating from 1 to 10, correlating average scale ratings with proposed extensions for food products. Higher ratings, such as 10, are associated with simple, direct applications like \"Peanuts,\" while progressively lower ratings encompass more complex or varied product categories. For instance, a rating of 9 includes \"Snack mixes, nuts for baking,\" and a rating of 7 covers \"Pretzels, chocolate nut candy, caramel corn.\" As the scale decreases, the proposed extensions broaden to include items like \"Snack crackers, potato chips, nutritional granola bars\" at a rating of 6, and \"Tortilla chips, toppings (ice cream/dessert)\" at a rating of 5. Further down the scale, ratings of 4 and 3 involve \"Lunchables/lunch snack packs, dessert mixes\" and \"Ice cream/ice cream bars, toppings (salad/vegetable),\" respectively. The lowest ratings, 2 and 1, are linked to a wide array of products including \"Cereal, toaster pastries, Asian entrees/sauces, stuffing mix, refrigerated dough, jams/jellies\" and \"Yogurt,\" indicating a spectrum from primary ingredients to more processed or composite food items.",
