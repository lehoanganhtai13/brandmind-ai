  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines brand reinforcement strategies, focusing on building both brand awareness and brand image. For brand awareness, key questions revolve around product representation, benefits, and needs satisfied. Strategies to enhance awareness include innovation in product design, manufacturing, and merchandising, alongside consistent marketing support, continuity in brand meaning, protection of brand equity sources, and strategic trade-offs in marketing activities. For brand image, the focus shifts to how the brand differentiates products and establishes strong, favorable, and unique customer associations. This is supported by relevance in user and usage imagery. The structure suggests a hierarchical approach, where foundational brand awareness is built upon, leading to the development of a distinct brand image.",
