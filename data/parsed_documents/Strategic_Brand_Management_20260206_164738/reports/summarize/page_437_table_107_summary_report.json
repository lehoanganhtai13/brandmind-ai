  "summary_markdown": "Figure 12-2 outlines the advantages of brand extension, categorized into two primary areas: facilitating new product acceptance and providing feedback benefits to the parent brand and company. For new product acceptance, brand extensions can improve brand image, reduce customer-perceived risk, and increase the likelihood of gaining distribution and trial. They also enhance the efficiency of promotional expenditures and reduce the costs associated with introductory and follow-up marketing programs, while avoiding the expense of developing an entirely new brand. Furthermore, brand extensions can lead to packaging and labeling efficiencies and cater to consumer variety-seeking behavior. In terms of feedback benefits, extensions can clarify brand meaning, enhance the parent brand image, attract new customers to broaden market coverage, and revitalize the brand, ultimately permitting subsequent extensions.",
