  "summary_markdown": "Figure 4-3 presents a taxonomy of brand names, categorizing them based on their origin and nature. The categories include \"Surname\" brands, exemplified by Dell, Siemens, and Gillette, which are derived from personal names. \"Descriptive\" brands, such as American Online, Pizza Hut, and General Motors, convey a direct characteristic or benefit of the product or service. \"Invented\" brands, like Häagen-Dazs, Kodak, and Xerox, are entirely fabricated words. \"Connotative\" brands, including Duracell, Humana, and Infiniti, evoke a particular feeling or association. \"Bridge\" brands, such as Westin, DaimlerChrysler, and ExxonMobil, combine elements to create a new identity. Finally, \"Arbitrary\" brands, like Apple, Yahoo!, and Infiniti, have no inherent connection to the product or service they represent. This taxonomy illustrates diverse strategies employed in brand naming.",
