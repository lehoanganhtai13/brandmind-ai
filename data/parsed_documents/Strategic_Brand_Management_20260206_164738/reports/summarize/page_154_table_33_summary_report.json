  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines common pitfalls to avoid when naming a product or company. It highlights seven specific issues, including the overuse of generic terms like \"Innovation\" or \"Solution,\" reliance on common English dictionary words which can lead to scarcity and linguistic problems, and the use of initials which require significant marketing investment to imbue with meaning. The table also cautions against employing terms such as \"Extra\" or \"Plus\" for product extensions, adopting unclear shorthand, combining too many names into a confusing brand, and soliciting suggestions from uninformed sources, as these approaches often fail to effectively communicate a company's strategy or resonate with customers. The overarching structure is a comparative list of undesirable naming strategies and their associated drawbacks.",
