  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines various linguistic devices used in product naming, categorized into Phonetic, Orthographic, Morphologic, and Semantic devices. Phonetic devices involve sound repetition and alteration, including alliteration, assonance, consonance, and different types of rhyme, as well as onomatopoeia and sound-based name modifications like clipping and blending, exemplified by Coca-Cola, Kal Kan, Weight Watchers, Max Pax, American Airlines, Black & Decker, Wisk, Chevy, Aspergum, and Duracell. Orthographic devices utilize unusual spellings, abbreviations, and acronyms, seen in Kool-Aid, 7 UP, and Amoco. Morphologic devices employ affixation and compounding, as in Jell-O and Janitor-in-a-Drum. Semantic devices leverage meaning and figurative language, such as metaphor (Arrid, AquaFresh), metonymy (Midas), synecdoche (Red Lobster), personification (Betty Crocker), oxymoron (Easy-Off), paranomasia (Hawaiian Punch), and semantic appositeness (Bufferin), to create evocative and memorable brand names.",
