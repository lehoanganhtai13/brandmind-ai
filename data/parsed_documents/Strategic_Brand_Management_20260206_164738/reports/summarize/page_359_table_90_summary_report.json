The four factors in the BAV model can easily be related to specific components of the brand resonance model:<br><br>\n* BAV’s Differentiation relates to brand superiority.<br>\n* BAV’s Relevance relates to brand consideration.<br>\n* BAV’s Esteem relates to brand credibility.<br>\n* BAV’s Knowledge relates to brand resonance.<br><br>\nNote that brand awareness and familiarity are handled differently in the two approaches. The brand resonance framework maintains that brand salience and breadth and depth of awareness is a necessary <i>first</i> step in building brand equity. The BAV model treats familiarity in a more affective manner—almost in a warm feeling or friendship sense—and thus sees it as the <i>last</i> step in building brand equity, more akin to the resonance component itself.<br><br>\nThe main advantage of the BAV model is that it provides rich category-agnostic descriptions and profiles across a large number of brands. It also provides focus on four key branding dimensions. It provides a brand landscape in which marketers can see where their brands stand relative to other prominent brands in many different markets.<br><br>\nThe descriptive nature of the BAV model does mean, however, that there is potentially less insight as to exactly <i>how</i> a brand could rate highly on those factors. Because the measures underlying the four factors have to be relevant across a very disparate range of product categories, the measures (and, consequently, the factors) tend to be abstract in nature and not related directly to product attributes and benefits, or more specific marketing concerns. Nevertheless, the BAV model represents a landmark study in terms of its ability to enhance marketers’ understanding of what drives top brands and where their brands fit in a vast brandscape.\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">Android by Google</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"chrome_icon.png\" alt=\"Chrome icon\" style=\"height:30px;\"><br>\nGoogle Mobile\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"google_docs_icon.png\" alt=\"Google Docs icon\" style=\"height:30px;\"><br>\nGoogle Buzz\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\nGoogle News\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">50</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\">Brand Stature</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>",
  "summary_markdown": "This figure presents a comparative analysis of Google's new product introductions, specifically focusing on Chrome and Android, within a brand stature framework. The data is structured to visualize the relative success or positioning of these products. Chrome is positioned at the highest level of brand stature (100), with its associated category identified as \"Google Mobile.\" Android by Google is also represented, though its specific positioning on the brand stature scale is not explicitly detailed in relation to Chrome's 100. Additionally, Google Buzz and Google News are depicted, with Google Buzz appearing to have a lower brand stature than Chrome, and Google News's stature also not precisely quantified in this visual. The overarching structure is comparative, using brand stature as the metric to differentiate and position these Google products.",
