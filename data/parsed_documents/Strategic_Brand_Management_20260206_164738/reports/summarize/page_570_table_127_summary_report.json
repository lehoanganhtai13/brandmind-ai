  "summary_markdown": "Figure 15-12 illustrates alternative communication options within the Business-to-Business (B2B) market, focusing on the strategic use of customer relationships in advertising. The core idea is that highlighting existing customer relationships, such as identifying companies that purchase a firm's products or services, can effectively convey credibility. However, a significant challenge arises in managing this advertising approach: ensuring that the mention of these other companies does not detract from the primary message about the advertised company and its own brands. This suggests a delicate balance between leveraging customer endorsements and maintaining brand focus in B2B marketing communications.",
