  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a 2x2 matrix illustrating four distinct growth strategies, categorized by their focus on current versus new products and current versus new markets. The strategies are: Market Penetration, which involves selling current products to current markets; Product Development, focusing on new products for current markets; Market Development, which targets new markets with current products; and Diversification, encompassing the introduction of new products into new markets. This framework highlights how businesses can achieve growth by either deepening their presence in existing areas or expanding into novel ones, with varying degrees of risk and innovation associated with each approach. The structure is comparative, contrasting strategies based on two key dimensions of market and product orientation.",
