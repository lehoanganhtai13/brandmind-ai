It’s typically not true that “if you build a great product, they will come.” You need well-designed and well-funded marketing programs to create brand awareness and a strong brand image. Non-product-related associations concerning brand personality or other imagery may be important, especially in distinguishing near-parity products.\n\n**Create corporate credibility associations.** One implication of rapid product turnover is the need to create a corporate or family brand with strong credibility associations. Because of the often complex nature of high-tech products and the continual introduction of new products or modifications of existing products, consumer perceptions of the expertise and trustworthiness of the firm are particularly important. In a high-tech setting, trustworthiness also relates to consumers’ perceptions of the firm’s longevity and staying power. For technology companies, the president or CEO often is a key component of the brand and performs an important brand-building and communication function, in some cases as an advocate of the technology. Consider the late Steve Jobs, for example.\n\n**Leverage secondary associations of quality.** Lacking the ability to judge the quality of high-tech products, consumers may use brand reputation as a means to reduce risk. This means secondary associations may better communicate product quality, such as third-party endorsements from top companies, leading consumer magazines, or industry experts. To garner these endorsements, however, products need to achieve demonstrable differences in product performance, suggesting the importance of innovative product development over time.\n\n**Avoid overbranding products.** One mistake high-tech firms often make is to “overbrand” products by using too many ingredient and endorser brands. In a kind of “NASCAR effect,” so many brands and logos are present for all the different product ingredients that the consumer can be overwhelmed or confused, and no individual brand element adds much value.\n\n**Selectively introduce new products as new brands, and clearly identify brand extensions.** Short product life cycles in high-tech industries make well-designed brand portfolios and hierarchies even more important. With new products continually emerging, it would be prohibitively expensive to brand them with new names in each case. Typically, names for new products include modifiers from existing products—for example, alphabetical (Microsoft Windows XP), numerical (Microsoft Xbox 360), time-based (Microsoft Exchange Server 2010), or other schemes. A new name for a new product signals a major departure that is significantly different from prior versions.\n\nThus, family brands are an important means of grouping products. Marketers must clearly distinguish individual items or products within those brand families, however, and define brand migration strategies that reflect product introduction strategies and consumer market trends. When high-tech firms continually introduce totally new sub-brands, it grows difficult for consumers to develop product or brand loyalty to any one brand.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
  "summary_markdown": "Figure 15-13 outlines additional branding guidelines for high-tech products, emphasizing strategies to navigate short product life cycles. Key recommendations include establishing strong brand awareness and a rich brand image, moving beyond product specifications alone to drive sales, and leveraging non-product associations for differentiation. It's crucial to create corporate credibility associations, building trust and perceived expertise due to rapid product turnover and complexity, with the CEO often playing a significant brand-building role. Secondary associations, such as third-party endorsements, are vital for communicating quality when consumers struggle to assess it directly. Conversely, firms should avoid \"overbranding\" by limiting ingredient and endorser brands to prevent consumer confusion. Finally, the guidelines advocate for selectively introducing new products as new brands or clearly identified brand extensions, utilizing modifiers or new names to signal significant departures, and managing brand portfolios and hierarchies to foster consumer loyalty amidst continuous innovation.",
