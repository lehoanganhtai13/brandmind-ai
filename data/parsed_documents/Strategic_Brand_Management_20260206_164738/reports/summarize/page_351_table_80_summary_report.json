Intended for long-term, exclusive commitment.</td>\n<td>Karen’s husband’s preferred brands (e.g., Mop’n Glo, Palmolive, Hellman’s); Karen’s Estée Lauder, imposed through gift-giving; Jean’s use of Murphy’s Oil Soap as per manufacturer recommendation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Casual friend/buddy:</b> Friendship low in affect and intimacy, characterized by infrequent or sporadic engagement and few expectations of reciprocity or reward.</td>\n<td>Karen and her household cleaning brands.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Marriage of convenience:</b> Long-term, committed relationship precipitated by environmental influence rather than deliberate choice, and governed by satisfying rules.</td>\n<td>Vicki’s switch to regional Friend’s Baked Beans brand from favored B&M brand left behind; Jean’s loyalty to DeMoulas salad dressing brand left behind by client at the bar.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Committed partnership:</b> Long-term, voluntarily imposed, socially supported union high in love, intimacy, trust, and commitment to stay together despite adverse circumstances. Adherence to exclusivity rules expected.</td>\n<td>Jean and virtually all her cooking, cleaning, and household appliance brands; Karen and Gatorade.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Best friendship:</b> Voluntary union based on reciprocity principle, the endurance of which is ensured through continued provision of positive rewards. Characterized by revelation of true self, honesty, and intimacy. Congruity in partner images and personal interests common.</td>\n<td>Karen and Reebok running shoes; Vicki and Crest or Ivory.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Compartmentalized friendship:</b> Highly specialized, situationally confined, enduring friendship characterized by lower intimacy than other friendship forms but higher socio-emotional rewards and interdependence. Easy entry and exit.</td>\n<td>Vicki and her stable of shampoos, perfumes, and lingerie brands.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Kinship:</b> Nonvoluntary union with lineage ties.</td>\n<td>Vicki’s preferences for Tetley tea or Karen’s for Ban, Joy, and Miracle Whip, all of which were inherited through their mothers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rebound relationship:</b> Union precipitated by desire to replace prior partner, as opposed to attraction to replacement partner.</td>\n<td>Karen’s use of Comet, Gateway, and Success Rice.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Childhood friendship:</b> Infrequently engaged, affective relation reminiscent of childhood times. Yields comfort and security of past self.</td>\n<td>Jean and Jell-O pudding.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Courtship:</b> Interim relationship state on the road to committed partnership contract.</td>\n<td>Vicki and her Musk scent brands.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Dependency:</b> Obsessive, highly emotional, selfish attractions cemented by feeling that the other is irreplaceable. Separation from other yields anxiety. High tolerance of other’s transgressions results.</td>\n<td>Karen and Mary Kay; Vicki and Soft ‘n Dry.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Fling:</b> Short-term, time-bounded engagement of high emotional reward. Devoid entirely of commitment and reciprocity demands.</td>\n<td>Vicki’s trial-size shampoo brands.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enmity:</b> Intensely involving relationship characterized by negative affect and desire to inflict pain or revenge on the other.</td>\n<td>Karen and her husband’s brands, postdivorce; Jean and her other-recommended-but-rejected brands (e.g., ham, peanut butter, sinks).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enslavement:</b> Nonvoluntary relationship union governed entirely by desires of the relationship partner.</td>\n<td>Karen and Southern Bell, Cable Vision. Vicki and Playtex, a bra for large-breasted women.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Secret affair:</b> Highly emotive, privately held relationship considered risky if exposed to others.</td>\n<td>Karen and the Tootsie Pops she sneaks at work.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
