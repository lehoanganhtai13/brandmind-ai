  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative overview of celebrity endorsement mishaps, detailing instances where prominent figures faced consequences for personal or public controversies. The structure highlights specific celebrities and the brands they represented, juxtaposed with the nature of the mishap that led to the termination of their endorsement deals. Examples include actors James Garner and Cybil Shepherd dropped due to health issues and dietary claims, respectively, and athlete Martina Hingis suing her sponsor over an injury. More severe consequences arose from legal and ethical breaches, such as Michael Vick's dog-fighting conviction, Kobe Bryant's sexual assault charges, and Kate Moss's drug use, all resulting in significant financial losses from lost endorsements. Similarly, Michael Phelps and Tiger Woods faced repercussions for drug use and infidelity, respectively, leading to the withdrawal of their brand partnerships. Whoopi Goldberg's case illustrates how public political commentary can also impact endorsement relationships.",
