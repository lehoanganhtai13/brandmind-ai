  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a hierarchical structure of marketing communications, broadly categorized into Media advertising, Consumer promotions, and Trade promotions. Media advertising encompasses traditional channels like TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines, alongside direct response methods (mail, telephone) and place advertising (billboards, point-of-purchase displays). Consumer promotions are further divided into direct incentives (samples, coupons, price-offs) and interactive digital strategies (websites, e-mails, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and video content). Trade promotions target intermediaries with tools such as trade deals, allowances, push money, and training programs. The structure also highlights the growing importance of digital and interactive elements within consumer promotions, including mobile marketing and online advertising formats. Additionally, it acknowledges other key promotional tools like publicity, public relations, word-of-mouth, and personal selling.",
