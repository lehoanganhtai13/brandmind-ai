  "summary_markdown": "This table illustrates a three-tiered branding strategy, moving from a leveraged equity model to a product-balanced equity model, and finally to an endorsement brand. At the highest level, DuPont™ Teflon® represents the leveraged equity, signifying the broad recognition and trust associated with the DuPont brand. This is then distilled into the product-balanced equity of \"Teflon,\" focusing the brand association directly onto the product itself. The endorsement brand level, \"Enhanced with DuPont® science Teflon® for nonstick coatings,\" further refines this by explicitly linking the product's performance attributes (nonstick coatings) to the scientific backing of DuPont, creating a specific value proposition for consumers. This structure demonstrates a progression from a broad corporate association to a specific product benefit, leveraging the parent brand's reputation to enhance the perceived quality and innovation of the sub-brand.",
