  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a hierarchical framework for brand building, detailing tools, objectives, and their effects on consumer knowledge and overall branding benefits. The process begins with **Choosing Brand Elements** such as names, logos, and slogans, which aim to achieve memorability, meaningfulness, appeal, transferability, adaptability, and protectability. These elements contribute to **Brand Awareness**, encompassing depth (recall and recognition) and breadth (purchase and consumption). Concurrently, **Developing Marketing Programs** involves strategic decisions regarding product, price, distribution, and communications, which are intended to foster **Brand Associations** that are strong, favorable, and unique. Finally, **Leverage of Secondary Associations**, including company, country of origin, and endorsers, further supports awareness, meaningfulness, and transferability. The ultimate **Branding Benefits** derived from these efforts include greater loyalty, reduced vulnerability to competition, larger margins, more elastic price responses, increased trade cooperation, enhanced marketing efficiency, licensing opportunities, and favorable brand extension evaluations.",
