  "summary_markdown": "This framework outlines a point-allocation system for evaluating new product concepts, structured around four key perspectives: Consumer, Company, Competitive, and Brand. Under Consumer Perspectives (Desirability), points assess product category appeal, equity transfer (brand fit), and perceived consumer target fit. Company Perspectives (Deliverability) evaluate asset leverage (technology, skills, marketing), profit potential, and launch feasibility. Competitive Perspectives (Differentiability) consider comparative appeal (advantages vs. disadvantages), competitive response (likelihood and immunity), and legal/regulatory barriers. Finally, Brand Perspectives (Equity Feedback) gauge how the concept strengthens parent brand equity, facilitates extensions, and improves the asset base. A total point score is then calculated, providing a quantitative measure for concept assessment.",
