  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines a framework for analyzing marketing strategies, focusing on two primary equity types: Brand Equity and Customer Equity. Brand Equity is characterized by an emphasis on bottom-line financial value and Customer Relationship Management, though it notes the absence of analysis regarding network effects and competition. Customer Equity, presented as a distinct but related concept, is also emphasized by its bottom-line financial value and Customer Relationship Management. The overall framework highlights prescriptive marketing guidelines and growth opportunities, with a stated missing component of segmentation analysis and quantifiable financial effects. The structure appears comparative, contrasting the components and emphases of Brand Equity and Customer Equity within a broader marketing strategy context.",
