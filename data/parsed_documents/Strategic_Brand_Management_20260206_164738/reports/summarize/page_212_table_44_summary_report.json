  "summary_markdown": "Figure 5-7 outlines the major brand responses to the emergence of private labels, presenting a multi-faceted strategy. These responses primarily focus on cost management and product differentiation. Key actions include decreasing costs and cutting prices to remain competitive, alongside increasing research and development (R&D) expenditures to enhance existing products and foster innovation. Brands also aim to bolster their market presence by increasing advertising and promotion budgets, and by streamlining their portfolios through the elimination of stagnant brands and extensions to concentrate resources. Furthermore, companies may introduce discount \"fighter\" brands to directly counter private label offerings, or even choose to supply private label makers themselves. Finally, a strategic approach involves closely tracking the growth of store brands and tailoring competitive efforts on a market-by-market basis.",
