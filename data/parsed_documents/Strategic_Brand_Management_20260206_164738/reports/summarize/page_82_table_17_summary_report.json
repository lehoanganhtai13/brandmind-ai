  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of product usage across different stages, illustrating a decline in user engagement as usage frequency increases. The categories range from \"Aware\" to \"Most Often Use,\" with corresponding percentages indicating the proportion of users at each stage. A significant majority, 72%, are \"Aware\" of the product, while 46% have \"Ever Tried\" it. The percentage of users decreases substantially for \"Recent Trial\" (58%), \"Occasional Use\" (50%), and \"Regular Use\" (56%). The smallest user group, 5%, falls into the \"Most Often Use\" category, highlighting a steep drop-off in consistent engagement. This structure reveals a funnel-like progression where initial awareness and trial lead to progressively smaller segments of dedicated, frequent users.",
