  "summary_markdown": "The Gillette Razor Brand History table outlines a chronological progression of product innovations from 1971 to 2009. The history begins with the introduction of the Trac II, the first twin-blade razor, followed by the disposable Good News razor in 1973. Subsequent developments focused on enhancing the twin-blade design, introducing features like a pivoting head with the Atra (1977), a lubricant strip with Atra Plus (1984), and individually mounted blades with Sensor (1988). The timeline then shows a specific adaptation for women with Sensor for Women (1991) and further refinement with microfins in Sensor Excel (1993). A significant shift occurred in 1997 with the Mach3, the first triple-blade razor, which was later enhanced in 1999 as Mach3 Turbo. The introduction of battery-powered vibration marked the M3 Power in 2002. The evolution continued with the development of a five-blade razor, the Fusion (2006), and culminated in the Fusion ProGlide (2009) with re-engineered, low-resistance blades.",
