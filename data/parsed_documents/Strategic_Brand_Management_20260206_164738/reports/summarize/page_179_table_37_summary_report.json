  "summary_markdown": "Figure 5-1 outlines the new capabilities afforded by the \"New Economy\" to both consumers and companies. Consumers gain enhanced power through increased access to a wider variety of goods and services, extensive information, and improved interaction channels with both marketers and other consumers for comparison and feedback. Companies, in turn, benefit from a new information and sales channel with expanded geographic reach, enabling them to gather richer market intelligence and engage in two-way communication with customers. This facilitates greater transaction efficiency, personalized offerings, and targeted marketing through permission-based e-mail. Furthermore, companies can leverage these capabilities to improve internal operations, including purchasing, recruiting, training, and communication. The structure is comparative, highlighting the distinct yet interconnected advantages for each economic actor.",
