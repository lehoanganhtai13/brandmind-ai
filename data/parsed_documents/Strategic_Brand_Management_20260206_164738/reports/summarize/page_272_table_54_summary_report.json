  "summary_markdown": "Figure 7-4 presents a comparative analysis of co-branding and licensing, outlining their respective advantages and disadvantages. Co-branding's advantages include increased brand awareness, shared marketing costs, and access to new customer segments, while its disadvantages can involve potential brand dilution, loss of control, and conflicts between partners. Licensing, on the other hand, offers revenue generation through royalties and brand expansion into new product categories, but its drawbacks include potential damage to brand reputation if the licensee produces low-quality goods, loss of direct control over product development and marketing, and the risk of creating a competitor. The figure's structure facilitates a direct comparison of these two distinct brand-leveraging strategies.",
