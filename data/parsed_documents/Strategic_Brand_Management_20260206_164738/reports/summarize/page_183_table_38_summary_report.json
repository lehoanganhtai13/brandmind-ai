  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines four distinct dimensions of brand experience: Sensory, Affective, Behavioral, and Intellectual. The Sensory dimension focuses on a brand's ability to make a strong impression on visual or other senses, evoking interest through sensory appeal. The Affective dimension concerns the feelings and sentiments a brand induces, distinguishing between brands that elicit strong emotions and those that do not. The Behavioral dimension relates to physical actions and bodily experiences associated with using a brand, indicating whether a brand is action-oriented. Finally, the Intellectual dimension describes the extent to which a brand stimulates thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving, contrasting brands that engage the mind with those that do not. These dimensions collectively represent a framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of consumer-brand interactions.",
