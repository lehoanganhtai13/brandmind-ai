It presents four examples: Weight Watchers, originally known for fitness centers, extended into low-calorie foods to reinforce its brand meaning of weight loss and maintenance. Sunkist, a brand associated with oranges, expanded into vitamins and juices, broadening its meaning to encompass good health. Kellogg's, a cereal manufacturer, introduced Nutri-Grain and Special K bars, shifting its brand meaning towards healthy snacking. Finally, Aunt Jemima, known for pancake mixes, diversified into syrups and frozen waffles, solidifying its brand meaning around breakfast foods. The structure is comparative, showcasing different brands and their respective original products, extension products, and the resulting new brand meanings.",
