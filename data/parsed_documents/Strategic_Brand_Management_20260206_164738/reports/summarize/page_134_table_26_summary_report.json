  "summary_markdown": "This Brand Positioning Model, presented as a comparative framework, delineates two critical aspects of brand strategy: Points-of-Parity and Points-of-Difference. Points-of-Parity represent the essential attributes or benefits that a brand must possess to be considered a legitimate competitor within its category, establishing a baseline of acceptance. Conversely, Points-of-Difference are the unique attributes or benefits that distinguish a brand from its competitors, providing a compelling reason for consumers to choose it. The model highlights the dual necessity for brands to meet category expectations while simultaneously carving out a distinct and desirable position in the minds of consumers.",
