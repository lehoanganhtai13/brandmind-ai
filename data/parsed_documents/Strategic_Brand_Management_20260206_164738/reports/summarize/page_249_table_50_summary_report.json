  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines three distinct communication options (A, B, and C) that are all presented as serving a common \"Audience.\" Option A is presented as a singular choice, while Options B and C are also presented as individual alternatives. The structure suggests a comparative analysis of these communication strategies, all directed towards a unified recipient group. The overarching theme is the presentation of multiple communication pathways, implying a decision-making process where one of these options would be selected to engage the specified audience.",
