  "summary_markdown": "Figure 14-2 outlines the disadvantages encountered when implementing global marketing programs, highlighting various areas of divergence. These disadvantages stem from differences in consumer behavior, including their needs, wants, usage patterns, and responses to branding and marketing mix elements. Furthermore, disparities exist in product and brand development, as well as in the competitive landscape across different markets. The legal environment and the nature of marketing institutions also present challenges. Finally, differences in administrative procedures represent another significant hurdle in global marketing efforts. The figure thus presents a comparative structure, detailing distinct categories of differences that complicate standardized global marketing strategies.",
