  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative analysis of ice cream brands, categorizing them by quality and consumer price. The primary classification is between \"Commodity\" and \"Specialty\" ice creams, with the latter further evaluated by a \"Consumer Reports rating.\" Within this framework, brands are assessed across four quality tiers: Excellent, Very good, Good, and Fair. For each quality tier, specific brands are listed, with some tiers showing multiple brands and others only one or none. A secondary axis displays the \"Consumer price, cents per 4-ounce serving,\" with a scale ranging from 0 to 50 cents, allowing for a direct comparison of the cost of different brands within their respective quality categories. The structure highlights how brands are positioned based on both perceived quality and economic value.",
