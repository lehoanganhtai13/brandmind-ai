  "summary_markdown": "The Brand Resonance Model, presented as a hierarchical structure, begins with **Salience** at its base, representing the awareness and availability of the brand. Building upon this foundation are two key dimensions: **Judgments**, which encompass perceptions of brand performance and quality, and **Feelings**, relating to the emotional responses evoked by the brand's imagery. At the apex of the model is **Resonance**, signifying the ultimate relationship between a brand and its customers, characterized by a deep psychological bond and a high degree of loyalty and attachment. This model illustrates a progression from basic brand awareness to a profound connection, with judgments and feelings acting as crucial intermediate stages in achieving resonance.",
