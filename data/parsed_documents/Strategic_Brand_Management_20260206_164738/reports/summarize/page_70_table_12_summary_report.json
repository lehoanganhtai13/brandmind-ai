  "summary_markdown": "Figure 2-1 outlines the marketing advantages conferred by strong brands, presenting a multifaceted view of their benefits. These advantages encompass enhanced customer perception, leading to improved product performance assessments and fostering greater loyalty. Strong brands also exhibit reduced susceptibility to competitive actions and marketing crises. Financially, they enable larger profit margins and influence consumer price sensitivity, making demand less elastic to price increases and more elastic to price decreases. Furthermore, strong brands facilitate improved relationships with trade partners, yielding greater cooperation and support. They also amplify the effectiveness of marketing communications and open avenues for licensing and brand extension opportunities.",
