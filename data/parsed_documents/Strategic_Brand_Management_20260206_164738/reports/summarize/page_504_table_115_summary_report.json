  "summary_markdown": "This table outlines brand revitalization strategies, organized around two primary approaches: refreshing or creating new sources of brand equity, and expanding brand awareness and usage. The first approach involves improving the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations by bolstering fading ones, neutralizing negative associations, or creating new ones. The second approach focuses on increasing the quantity and frequency of consumption, achieved by identifying additional or entirely new ways to use the brand. Both strategic paths aim to retain vulnerable customers, recapture lost ones, identify neglected market segments, and attract new customers, ultimately contributing to the overall revitalization of the brand.",
