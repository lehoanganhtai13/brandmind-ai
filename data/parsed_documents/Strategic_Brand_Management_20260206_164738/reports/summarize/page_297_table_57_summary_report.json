  "summary_markdown": "This table presents two distinct categories of research methods: \"Free association\" and \"Day/Behavior reconstruction.\" The \"Free association\" column encompasses techniques designed to elicit spontaneous thoughts and feelings, including adjective ratings and checklists, confessional interviews, projective techniques, photo sorts, archetypal research, bubble drawings, store telling, personification exercises, role playing, and metaphor elicitation (noted as a ZMET trademark). In contrast, the \"Day/Behavior reconstruction\" column focuses on methods that capture or recreate real-world experiences and actions. These include photo/written journals, participatory design, consumer-led problem solving, real-life experimenting, collaging and drawing, consumer shadowing, consumer–product interaction, and video observation. The structure is comparative, highlighting two different approaches to gathering qualitative data, one emphasizing internal cognitive processes and the other focusing on external observable behaviors and experiences.",
