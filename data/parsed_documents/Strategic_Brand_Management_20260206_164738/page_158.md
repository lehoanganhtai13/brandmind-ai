## GREEN GIANT

One of the most powerful brand characters ever introduced is General Mills’s Jolly Green Giant. His origin can be traced back to the 1920s, when the Minnesota Valley Canning Company placed a green giant on the label of a new variety of sweet, large English peas as a means to circumvent trademark laws that prevented the firm from naming the product “Green Giant.” Ad Agency Leo Burnett used the Jolly Green Giant character in print ads beginning in 1930 and in TV ads beginning in the early 1960s. At first, TV ads featured an actor wearing green body makeup and a suit of leaves. Later, the ads moved to full animation. Creatively, the ads have been very consistent. The Green Giant is always in the background, with his features obscure, and he says only “Ho Ho Ho!” He moves very little, doesn’t walk, and never leaves the valley. The Green Giant has been introduced into international markets, following the same basic set of rules. The Little Sprout character was introduced in 1973 to bring a new look to the brand and allow for more flexibility. Unlike the Green Giant, the Little Sprout is a chatterbox, often imparting valuable product information. The Green Giant brand has enormous equity to General Mills, and using the name and character on a new product has been an effective signal to consumers that the product is “wholesome” and “healthy.” Not surprisingly, the company has tied many of their recent green initiatives on sustainability to the Green Giant.<sup>46</sup>

**Benefits.** Because they are often colorful and rich in imagery, brand characters tend to be attention getting and quite useful for creating brand awareness. Brand characters can help brands break through marketplace clutter as well as help communicate a key product benefit. For example, Maytag’s Lonely Repairman has helped reinforce the company’s key “reliability” product association.

The human element of brand characters can enhance likeability and help create perceptions of the brand as fun and interesting.<sup>47</sup> A consumer may more easily form a relationship with a brand when the brand literally has a human or other character presence. Characters avoid many of the problems that plague human spokespeople—they don’t grow old, demand pay raises, or cheat on their wives. An interesting exception occurred, however, when Aflac fired the human voice to its famed duck character, comedian Gilbert Gottfried, after he posted some controversial remarks on Twitter that made light of the fallout from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.<sup>48</sup>

Finally, because brand characters do not typically have direct product meaning, they may also be transferred relatively easily across product categories. For example, Aaker notes that “the Keebler’s elf identity (which combines a sense of home-style baking with a touch of magic and fun) gives the brand latitude to extend into other baked goods—and perhaps even into other types of food where homemade magic and fun might be perceived as a benefit.”[^49] Popular characters also often become valuable licensing properties, providing direct revenue and additional brand exposure.
