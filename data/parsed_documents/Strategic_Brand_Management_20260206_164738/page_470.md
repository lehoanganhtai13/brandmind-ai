**Cultural differences across markets can influence extension success.** Building in part on branding research on individual differences, much recent research has explored how different cultures respond differently to brand extensions. Monga and John, as well as Ng and Houston, have shown that consumers from Eastern cultures (such as China) have a more holistic style of thinking and perceive higher levels of extension fit than do consumers from Western cultures (like the United States) who have a more analytical style of thinking.¹²¹  
Dilution effects for a typical or similar extension that fails also can vary by culture and consumer motivation: Consumers from Eastern cultures exhibit significantly greater dilution when their motivation is high; consumers from Western cultures exhibit significantly greater dilution when their motivation is low.¹²²  
Additionally, Torelli and Ahluwalia show that cultural congruency can aid culturally consistent brand extensions over and beyond the effects of perceived fit. They note that a cultural congruent brand extension might be something like Sony electric car; a culturally incongruent car might be something like Sony cappuccino-macchiato maker. According to the research, beyond the inherent levels of fit that any electronic manufacturer might enjoy with an electric car, Sony would be expected to get an extra boost in fit and evaluations because of its Japanese country of origin and Japan’s strong association with electronics.¹²³

## REVIEW  
Brand extensions occur when a firm uses an established brand name to introduce a new product. We can distinguish them by whether the new product is being introduced in a product category currently served by the parent brand (a line extension) or in a completely different product category (a category extension). Brand extensions can come in all forms. They offer many potential benefits but also can pose many problems.  

The basic assumptions behind brand extensions are that consumers have some awareness of and positive associations about the parent brand in memory, and that the brand extension will evoke at least some of these. Moreover, marketers assume that negative associations will not be transferred from the parent brand or created by the brand extension.  

The extension’s ability to establish its own equity will depend on the salience of consumers’ associations with the parent brand in the extension context and the favorability and uniqueness of any associations they infer. The extension’s ability to contribute to parent brand equity will depend on how compelling is the evidence about the corresponding attribute or benefit association in the extension context, how relevant or diagnostic the extension evidence is about the attribute or benefit for the parent brand, and how strong consumers’ existing attribute or benefit associations are for the parent brand.  

To evaluate brand extension opportunities, marketers need to carefully consider brand extension strategies by applying managerial judgment and consumer research to the following steps: Define actual and desired consumer knowledge about the brand, identify possible extension candidates, evaluate the potential of extension candidates, design marketing programs to launch extensions, and evaluate extension success and effects on parent brand equity. Finally, a number of important research findings deal with factors affecting the acceptance of a brand extension, as well as the nature of feedback to the parent brand.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1. Pick a brand extension. Use the models presented in the chapter to evaluate its ability to achieve its own equity as well as contribute to the equity of a parent brand. If you were the manager of that brand, what would you do differently?  
2. Do you think Virgin’s brand is overextended? What are the arguments for or against?  
3. How successful do you predict these recently proposed extensions will be? Why?  
   a. Mont Blanc (famous for pens): fragrances and other accessories (watches, cufflinks, sunglasses, and pocket knives)  
   b. Evian (famous for water): high-end spas  
   c. Starbucks (famous for coffee): film production and promotion  
   d. Trump (famous for hotels and casinos): vodka and mortgage services 4.
