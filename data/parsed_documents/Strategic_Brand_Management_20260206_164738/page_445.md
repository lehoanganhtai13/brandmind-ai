# AUDI

Even though there was little concrete evidence to support the claims, Audi, in a public relations disaster, attributed the problem to the clumsy way U.S. drivers operated the car, and U.S. sales declined from 74,000 in 1985 to 21,000 in 1989. As might be expected, the damage was most severe for the Audi 5000, but the adverse publicity also spilled over to the 4000 model. The Quattro was affected to a lesser extent, perhaps because it was distanced by its distinct branding and advertising strategy.  

Understanding when unsuccessful brand extensions may damage the parent brand is important, and later in the chapter we’ll develop a conceptual model to address the topic and describe some important findings. On a more positive note, however, one reason an unsuccessful brand extension may not necessarily damage the parent brand is the very reason the extension may have been unsuccessful in the first place—hardly anyone may even have heard of it! Thus, the silver lining when a brand extension fails to achieve sufficient brand awareness or distribution is that the parent brand is more likely to survive unscathed. But as we’ll argue below, product failures in which the extension is found to be inadequate on the basis of performance are more likely to hurt perceptions of the parent brand than these “market” failures.

## Can Succeed but Cannibalize Sales of Parent Brand

Even if sales of a brand extension are high and meet targets, success may result merely from consumers switching from existing offerings of the parent brand—in effect cannibalizing it. Line extensions designed to establish points-of-parity with current offerings in the parent brand category particularly may result in cannibalization. Sometimes, however, such intrabrand shifts in sales are not undesirable; we can think of them as a form of “preemptive cannibalization.” In other words, without the introduction of the line extension, consumers might have switched to a competing brand instead.

For example, Diet Coke’s point-of-parity of “good taste” and point-of-difference of “low calories” undoubtedly took some sales from regular Coke drinkers. In fact, although U.S. sales of Coca-Cola’s cola products have held steady since 1980, sales in 1980 came from Coke alone, whereas sales today include significant contributions from Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, and uncaffeinated and flavored forms of Coke. Without the introduction of those extensions, however, some of Coke’s sales might have gone to competing Pepsi products or other soft drinks or beverages instead.

## Can Succeed but Diminish Identification with Any One Category

One risk of linking multiple products to a single brand is that the brand may not be strongly identified with any one product. Thus, brand extensions may obscure the brand’s identification with its original categories, reducing brand awareness. For example, when Cadbury became linked in the United Kingdom to mainstream food products such as Smash instant potatoes, its marketers may have run the risk of weakening its association to fine chocolates. Pepperidge Farm is another brand that has been accused of extending so much (into pastries, bread, and snacks) that it has lost its original meaning of “delicious, high-quality cookies.”

Some notable—and fascinating—counterexamples to these dilution effects exist, however, in firms that have branded a heterogeneous set of products and still achieved a reasonable level of perceived quality for each. As we saw in Chapter 11, many Japanese firms have adopted a corporate branding strategy with a very broad product portfolio. For example, Yamaha developed a strong reputation selling an extremely diverse brand line that includes motorcycles, guitars, and pianos. Mitsubishi uses its name to brand a bank, cars, and aircraft. Canon has successfully marketed cameras, photocopiers, and office equipment.

In a similar vein, the founder of Virgin Records, Richard Branson, has conducted an ambitious, and perhaps risky, brand extension program (see Branding Brief 12-2). In all these cases, it seems the brand has been able to secure a dominant association to quality in the minds of consumers without strong product identification that might otherwise limit it.
