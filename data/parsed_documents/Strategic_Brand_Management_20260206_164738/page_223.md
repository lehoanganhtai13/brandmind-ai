Different advertising media clearly have different strengths, however, and therefore are best suited to play certain roles in a communication program. Brand Focus 6.0 provides some empirical generalizations about advertising. Now we’ll highlight some key issues about each type of advertising medium in turn.

### Television.  
Television is a powerful advertising medium because it allows for sight, sound, and motion and reaches a broad spectrum of consumers. Virtually all U.S. households have televisions, and the average hours viewed per person per week in the United States in 2010 was 34 hours, an all-time high.⁷ The wide reach of TV advertising translates to low cost per exposure.

**Pros & Cons.**  
From a brand equity perspective, TV advertising has two particularly important strengths. First, it can be an effective means of vividly demonstrating product attributes and persuasively explaining their corresponding consumer benefits. Second, TV advertising can be a compelling means for dramatically portraying user and usage imagery, brand personality, emotions, and other brand intangibles.

On the other hand, television advertising has its drawbacks. Because of the fleeting nature of the message and the potentially distracting creative elements often found in a TV ad, consumers can overlook product-related messages and the brand itself. Moreover, the large number of ads and nonprogramming material on television creates clutter that makes it easy for consumers to ignore or forget ads. The large number of channels creates fragmentation, and the widespread existence of digital video recorders gives viewers the means to skip commercials.

Another important disadvantage of TV ads is the high cost of production and placement. In 2010, for example, a 30-second spot to air during the popular *American Idol* on FOX ran between $360,000 and $490,000. A 30-second spot on even a new network show typically costs over $100,000.⁸ Although the price of TV advertising has skyrocketed, the share of the prime time audience for the major networks has steadily declined. By any number of measures, the effectiveness of any one ad, on average, has diminished.

Nevertheless, properly designed and executed TV ads can affect sales and profits. For example, over the years, one of the most consistently successful TV advertisers has been Apple. The “1984” ad for the introduction of its Macintosh personal computer—portraying a stark Orwellian future with a feature film look—ran only once on TV, but is one of the best-known ads ever. In the years that followed, Apple advertising successfully created awareness and image for a series of products, more recently with the acclaimed “Get a Mac” global ad campaign.⁹

### APPLE  
Apple Computer’s highly successful “Get a Mac” ad campaign—also known as “Mac vs. PC”—featured two actors bantering about the merits of their respective brands: one is hip looking (Apple), the other nerdy looking (PC). The campaign quickly went global. Apple, recognizing its potential, dubbed the ads for Spain, France, Germany, and Italy; however, it chose to reshoot and rescript for the United Kingdom and Japan—two important markets with unique advertising and comedy cultures. The UK ads followed a similar formula but used two well-known actors in character and tweaked the jokes to reflect British humor. The Japanese ads avoided direct comparisons and were more subtle in tone. Played by comedians from a local troupe called the Rahmens, the two characters were more similar in nature but represented work (PC) versus home (Mac). Creative but effective in any language, the ads helped provide a stark contrast between the two brands, making the Apple brand more relevant and appealing to a whole new group of consumers.

**Guidelines.**  
In designing and evaluating an ad campaign, marketers should distinguish the *message strategy* or positioning of an ad (what the ad attempts to convey about the brand) from its *creative strategy* (the way the ad expresses the brand claims). Designing effective advertising campaigns is both an art and a science: The artistic aspects relate to the creative strategy of the ad and its execution; the scientific aspects relate to the message strategy and the brand claim information the ad contains. Thus, as Figure 6-3 describes, the two main concerns in devising an advertising strategy are as follows:

* Defining the proper positioning to maximize brand equity  
* Identifying the best creative strategy to communicate or convey the desired positioning * **Competitive frame of reference**
