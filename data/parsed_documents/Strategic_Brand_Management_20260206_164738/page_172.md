This table presents a comparative analysis of different branding elements—Brand Names and URLs, Logos and Symbols, Characters, Slogans and Jingles, and Packaging and Signage—across six criteria: Memorability, Meaningfulness, Likability, Transferability, Adaptability, and Protectability. The structure is comparative, evaluating each branding element's strengths and weaknesses against these criteria. Brand Names and Slogans excel in Memorability and Meaningfulness, capable of enhancing recall and conveying explicit associations. Logos and Characters are strong in recognition and protectability, with Characters particularly adept at generating human qualities. Packaging and Signage offer good transferability and adaptability, often combining visual and verbal appeal. However, Brand Names and Characters face limitations in transferability and adaptability, while Packaging and Signage are more susceptible to copying. Overall, the table highlights the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each branding component in building a strong brand identity.

> Because different brand elements have different strengths and weaknesses, marketers “mix and match” to maximize their collective contribution to brand equity. Figure 4-8 offers a critique of different brand elements according to the six key criteria.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Pick a brand. Identify all its brand elements and assess their ability to contribute to brand equity according to the choice criteria identified in this chapter.  
2. What are your favorite brand characters? Do you think they contribute to brand equity in any way? How? Can you relate their effects to the customer-based brand equity model?  
3. What are some other examples of slogans not listed in the chapter that make strong contributions to brand equity? Why? Can you think of any “bad” slogans? Why do you consider them to be so?  
4. Choose a package of any supermarket product. Assess its contribution to brand equity. Justify your decisions.  
5. Can you think of some general guidelines to help marketers mix and match brand elements? Can you ever have “too many” brand elements? Which brand do you think does the best job of mixing and matching brand elements?

## Legal Branding Considerations

According to Dorothy Cohen, under common law, “a ‘technical’ trademark is defined as any fanciful arbitrary, distinctive, and nondescriptive mark, word, letter, number, design, or picture that denominates and is affixed to goods; it is an inherently distinctive trade symbol that identifies a product.”[^82] She maintains that **trademark strategy** involves proper trademark planning, implementation, and control, as follows:

* **Trademark planning** requires selecting a valid trademark, adopting and using the trademark, and engaging in search and clearance processes.  
* **Trademark implementation** requires effectively using the trademark in enacting marketing decisions, especially with respect to promotional and distributional strategies.  
* **Trademark control** requires a program of aggressive policing of a trademark to ensure its efficient usage in marketing activities, including efforts to reduce trademark counterfeiting and to prevent the trademark from becoming generic, as well as instituting suits for infringement of the trademark.
