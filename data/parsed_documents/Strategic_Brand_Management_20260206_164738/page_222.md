One implication of the information processing model is that to increase the odds for a successful marketing communications campaign, marketers must attempt to increase the likelihood that *each* step occurs. For example, from an advertising standpoint, the ideal ad campaign would ensure that:

1. The right consumer is exposed to the right message at the right place and at the right time.  
2. The creative strategy for the advertising causes the consumer to notice and attend to the ad but does not distract from the intended message.  
3. The ad properly reflects the consumer’s level of understanding about the product and the brand.  
4. The ad correctly positions the brand in terms of desirable and deliverable points-of-difference and points-of-parity.  
5. The ad motivates consumers to consider purchase of the brand.  
6. The ad creates strong brand associations to all these stored communication effects so that they can have an effect when consumers are considering making a purchase.

Clearly, marketers need to design and execute marketing communication programs carefully if they are to have the desired effects on consumers.

### Role of Multiple Communications

How much and what kinds of marketing communications are necessary? Economic theory suggests placing dollars into a marketing communication budget and across communication options according to marginal revenue and cost. For example, the communication mix would be optimally distributed when the last dollar spent on each communication option generated the same return.

Because such information may be difficult to obtain, however, other models of budget allocation emphasize more observable factors such as stage of brand life cycle, objectives and budget of the firm, product characteristics, size of budget, and media strategy of competitors. These factors are typically contrasted with the different characteristics of the media.

For example, marketing communication budgets tend to be higher when there is low channel support, much change in the marketing program over time, many hard-to-reach customers, more complex customer decision making, differentiated products and nonhomogeneous customer needs, and frequent product purchases in small quantities.<sup>5</sup>

Besides these efficiency considerations, different communication options also may target different market segments. For example, advertising may attempt to bring new customers into the market or attract competitors’ customers to the brand, whereas promotions might attempt to reward loyal users of the brand.

Invariably, marketers will employ multiple communications to achieve their goals. In doing so, they must understand how each communication option works and how to assemble and integrate the best set of choices. The following section presents an overview and critique of four major marketing communication options from a brand-building perspective.

## FOUR MAJOR MARKETING COMMUNICATION OPTIONS

Our contention is that in the future there will be four vital ingredients to the best brand-building communication programs: (1) advertising and promotion, (2) interactive marketing, (3) events and experiences, and (4) mobile marketing. We consider each in turn.

### Advertising

*Advertising* is any paid form of nonpersonal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor. Although it is a powerful means of creating strong, favorable, and unique brand associations and eliciting positive judgments and feelings, advertising is controversial because its specific effects are often difficult to quantify and predict. Nevertheless, a number of studies using very different approaches have shown the potential power of advertising on brand sales. As Chapter 1 noted, the latest recession provided numerous examples of brands benefiting from increased advertising expenditures. A number of prior research studies are consistent with that view.<sup>6</sup>

Given the complexity of designing advertising—the number of strategic roles it might play, the sheer number of specific decisions to make, and its complicated effect on consumers—it is difficult to provide a comprehensive set of detailed managerial guidelines.
