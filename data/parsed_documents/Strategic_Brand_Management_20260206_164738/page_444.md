# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 12-1

## When Is Variety a Bad Thing?

Today, consumers face an unprecedented number of choices. Supermarkets can contain more than 40,000 products, up from only 7,000 in the 1960s, and product features continue to multiply. Take toothpaste. A supermarket can stock over 100 varieties depending on brand name (Colgate, Crest, Tom’s, Mentadent), benefits (tartar control, whitening, breath freshening, sensitive gums), flavors (regular, mint, cinnamon, citrus), and forms (gel, paste). Online shopping makes it easier to offer even more choice in many categories.

Consumers may like the idea of having more choice—the flexibility and sense of freedom it gives, the greater likelihood of finding just the right alternative—but negative consequences often arise too. Actually finding the optimal choice can require much effort and result in inner conflict and regret. The difficulty of making a decision can be overwhelming or demotivating, and some consumers may just choose to walk away.

Product assortment has been defined as the number of SKUs offered within a single product category. Consumer perception of assortment is one of the top three criteria, along with location and price, that affect their retail loyalty. Manufacturers and retailers are thus keenly interested in factors affecting the optimal product assortment size for a brand.

Consistent with the Food Marketing Institute study, much additional research has supported the conclusion that reducing the number of different items stocked does not necessarily adversely affect category volume, especially if the category already has a lot of SKUs or a few SKUs that are big sellers. Research has also found that consumer perceptions of variety assortment depend on factors such as the similarity of items for the brand, the amount of allocated shelf space, and the presence of the consumer’s favorite item.

Marketers and retailers can improve perceptions of product variety in a category or for a brand. For example, organized displays have been found to be better for large brand assortments, whereas unorganized displays are better for small brand assortments. Asymmetrical assortments—in which some items for a brand appear more frequently than others—have also been found to lead to perceptions of greater assortment.

The 1980s’ launch of Cadillac Cimarron was a disaster for General Motors because it alienated existing customers and at the same time failed to attract new ones.
