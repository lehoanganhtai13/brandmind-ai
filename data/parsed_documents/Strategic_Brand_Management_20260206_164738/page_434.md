As we noted in Chapter 11, when a new brand is combined with an existing brand (approach 3), the brand extension can also be a *sub-brand*. An existing brand that gives birth to a brand extension is the *parent brand*. If the parent brand is already associated with multiple products through brand extensions, then it may also be called a *family brand*.

Brand extensions fall into two general categories:²

* *Line extension:* Marketers apply the parent brand to a new product that targets a new market segment within a product category the parent brand currently serves. A line extension often adds a different flavor or ingredient variety, a different form or size, or a different application for the brand (like Head & Shoulders Dry Scalp shampoo).
* *Category extension:* Marketers apply the parent brand to enter a different product category from the one it currently serves (like Swiss Army watches).

The vast majority of new products in any one year are brand extensions. In 2009, 93 percent of the new food or beverage products with first-year sales that exceeded $7.5 million were brand extensions. Some notable food or beverage launches that year were Campbell’s Select Harvest soups, Bud Light Lime beer, Arnold Select Sandwich Thins rolls, and Kellogg’s FiberPlus snack bars.³ Some successful nonfood or beverage launches were Tide Total Care liquid laundry detergent, Quilted Northern Ultra Plush toilet paper, Gillette Venus Embrace razor, and Bounty ExtraSoft paper towels. All these new products were launched as extensions.⁴

Nevertheless, many new products are still introduced each year as new brands. A slew of new technology brands have recently begun to make their mark, such as SurveyMonkey online survey tool, Spotify music Web site, Lookout mobile security software, and Twilio voice and text messaging application facilitator. Dropbox makes downloadable software that lets users digitally store and share documents for a fee. New brands are not restricted to technology, however—consider the Chobani story.

## CHOBANI

In just a few short years, Chobani yogurt has challenged long-time market leaders Yoplait and Dannon and has become the number-one brand in the exploding Greek-style yogurt category. It even topped a January 2012 IRI InfoScan review of retail yogurt sales. Called “strained” yogurt in other parts of the world because it is typically strained in a cloth or paper bag or filter to remove the whey, Greek-style yogurt has a consistency between that of yogurt and cheese, but with yogurt’s distinctive sour taste. Greek-style yogurt now makes up 25 percent of all U.S. yogurt sales, with Chobani enjoying 60 percent of those sales. The brand was started by a Turkish immigrant, Hamdi Ulukaya, who came to the United States to go to college in 1994. Intrigued when an old Kraft yogurt factory in upstate New York came up for sale, he and his initial team spent a year and a half tinkering with the product. The first Chobani yogurt was introduced in 2007. Sales exploded, especially after the brand was picked up BJ’s Wholesale Club and Costco in 2009, and in less than five years, it had become a rapidly growing $700 million business. In 2011, the company made its first acquisition, an Australian dairy firm called Bead Foods, as a first step toward international distribution.⁵

The marketplace will always reward an innovative, well-marketed new product as happened with Chobani Greek yogurt.
