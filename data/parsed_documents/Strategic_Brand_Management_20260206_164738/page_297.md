This table presents two distinct categories of research methods: "Free association" and "Day/Behavior reconstruction." The "Free association" column encompasses techniques designed to elicit spontaneous thoughts and feelings, including adjective ratings and checklists, confessional interviews, projective techniques, photo sorts, archetypal research, bubble drawings, store telling, personification exercises, role playing, and metaphor elicitation (noted as a ZMET trademark). In contrast, the "Day/Behavior reconstruction" column focuses on methods that capture or recreate real-world experiences and actions. These include photo/written journals, participatory design, consumer-led problem solving, real-life experimenting, collaging and drawing, consumer shadowing, consumer–product interaction, and video observation. The structure is comparative, highlighting two different approaches to gathering qualitative data, one emphasizing internal cognitive processes and the other focusing on external observable behaviors and experiences.

> **Interpreting Qualitative Research.** There are a wide variety of qualitative research techniques. Marketers must carefully consider which ones to employ.

> **Criteria.** Levy identifies three criteria by which we can classify and judge any qualitative research technique: direction, depth, and diversity.<sup>8</sup> For example, any projective research technique varies in terms of the nature of the stimulus information (is it related to the person or the brand?), the extent to which responses are superficial and concrete as opposed to deeper and more abstract (and thus requiring more interpretation), and the way the information relates to information gathered by other projective techniques.

> In Figure 8-2, the tasks at the top of the left-hand list ask very specific questions whose answers may be easier to interpret. The tasks on the bottom of the list ask questions that are much richer but also harder to interpret. Tasks on the top of the right-hand list are elaborate exercises that consumers undertake themselves and that may be either specific or broadly directed. Tasks at the bottom of the right-hand list consist of direct observation of consumers as they engage in various behaviors.

> According to Levy, the more specific the question, the narrower the range of information given by the respondent. When the stimulus information in the question is open-ended and responses are freer or less constrained, the respondent tends to give more information. The more abstract and symbolic the research technique, however, the more important it is to follow up with probes and other questions that explicitly reveal the motivation and reasons behind consumers’ responses.

> Ideally, qualitative research conducted as part of the brand exploratory should vary in direction and depth as well as in technique. The challenge is to provide accurate interpretation—going beyond what consumers explicitly state to determine what they implicitly mean. Chapter 9 reviews how to best conduct qualitative research.

**Mental Maps and Core Brand Associations.** One useful outcome of qualitative research is a mental map. A *mental map* accurately portrays in detail all salient brand associations and responses for a particular target market. One of the simplest means to get consumers to create a mental map is to ask them for their top-of-mind brand associations (“When you think of this brand, what comes to mind?”). The brand resonance pyramid from Chapter 3 helps to highlight some of the types of associations and responses that may emerge from the creation of a mental map.

It is sometimes useful to group brand associations into related categories with descriptive labels. *Core brand associations* are those abstract associations (attributes and benefits) that characterize the 5–10 most important aspects or dimensions of a brand. They can serve as the basis of brand positioning in terms of how they create points-of-parity and points-of-difference. For example, in response to a Nike brand probe, consumers may list LeBron James, Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, or Lance Armstrong, whom we could call “top athletes.” The challenge is to include all relevant associations while making sure each is as distinct as possible. Figure 8-3 displays a hypothetical mental map and some core brand associations for MTV.
