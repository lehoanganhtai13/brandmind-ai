# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 1-2

## Understanding High-Tech Branding

Marketers operating in technologically intensive markets face a number of unique challenges. Here are 10 guidelines that managers for high-tech companies can use to improve their company’s brand strategy.

1. **It is important to have a brand strategy that provides a roadmap for the future.** Technology companies too often rely on the faulty assumption that the best product based on the best technology will sell itself. As the market failure of the Sony Betamax illustrates, the company with the best technology does not always win.

2. **Understand your brand hierarchy and manage it appropriately over time.** A strong corporate brand is vital in the technology industry to provide stability and help establish a presence on Wall Street. Since product innovations provide the growth drivers for technology companies, however, brand equity is sometimes built in the product name to the detriment of corporate brand equity.

3. **Know who your customer is and build an appropriate brand strategy.** Many technology companies understand that when corporate customers purchase business-to-business products or services, they are typically committing to a long-term relationship. For this reason, it is advisable for technology companies to establish a strong corporate brand that will endure over time.

4. **Realize that building brand equity and selling products are two different exercises.** Too often, the emphasis on developing products leads to an overemphasis on branding them. When a company applies distinct brand names to too many products in rapid succession, the brand portfolio becomes cluttered and consumers may lose perspective on the brand hierarchy. Rather than branding each new innovation separately, a better approach is to plan for future innovations by developing an extendable branding strategy.

5. **Brands are owned by customers, not engineers.** In many high-tech firms, CEOs work their way up the ladder through the engineering divisions. Although engineers have an intimate knowledge of products and technology, they may lack the big-picture brand view. Compounding this problem is the fact that technology companies typically spend less on consumer research compared with other types of companies. As a result of these factors, tech companies often do not invest in building strong brands.

6. **Brand strategies need to account for the attributes of the CEO and adjust accordingly.** Many of the world’s top technology companies have highly visible CEOs, especially compared with other industries. Some notable high-tech CEOs with prominent public personas include Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Cisco’s John Chambers, Dell’s Michael Dell, and (until 2011), Apple’s Steve Jobs. In each case, the CEO’s identity and persona are inextricably woven into the fabric of the brand.

7. **Brand building on a small budget necessitates leveraging every possible positive association.** Technology companies typically prioritize their marketing mix as follows (in order from most important to least important): industry analyst relations, public relations, trade shows, seminars, direct mail, and advertising. Often, direct mail and advertising are discretionary items in a company’s marketing budget and may in fact receive no outlay.

8. **Technology categories are created by customers and external forces, not by companies themselves.** In their quest for product differentiation, new technology companies have a tendency to reinvent the wheel and claim they have created a new category. Yet only two groups can truly create categories: analysts and customers. For this reason, it is important for technology companies to manage their relationships with analysts in order to attract consumers.

9. **The rapidly changing environment demands that you stay in tune with your internal and external environment.** The rapid pace of innovation in the technology sector dictates that marketers closely observe the market conditions in which their brands do business. Trends in brand strategy change almost as rapidly as the technology.

10. **Invest the time to understand the technology and value proposition and do not be afraid to ask questions.** It is important for technology marketers to ask questions in order to educate themselves and build credibility with the company’s engineering corps and with customers. To build trust among engineers and customers, marketers must strive to learn as much as they can about the technology.
