# Brand Charter

The first step in establishing a brand equity management system is to formalize the company view of brand equity into a document, the **brand charter**, or brand bible as it is sometimes called, that provides relevant guidelines to marketing managers within the company as well as to key marketing partners outside the company such as marketing research suppliers or ad agency staff. This document should crisply and concisely do the following:

* Define the firm’s view of branding and brand equity and explain why it is important.
* Describe the scope of key brands in terms of associated products and the manner by which they have been branded and marketed (as revealed by historical company records as well as the most recent brand audit).
* Specify what the actual and desired equity is for brands at all relevant levels of the brand hierarchy, for example, at both the corporate and the individual product level (as outlined in Chapter 11). The charter should define and clarify points-of-parity, points-of-difference, and the brand mantra.
* Explain how brand equity is measured in terms of the tracking study and the resulting brand equity report (described shortly).
* Suggest how marketers should manage brands with some general strategic guidelines, stressing clarity, consistency, and innovation in marketing thinking over time.
* Outline how to devise marketing programs along specific tactical guidelines, satisfying differentiation, relevance, integration, value, and excellence criteria. Guidelines for specific brand management tasks such as ad campaign evaluation and brand name selection may also be offered.
* Specify the proper treatment of the brand in terms of trademark usage, design considerations, packaging, and communications. As these types of instructions can be long and detailed, it is often better to create a separate *Brand or Corporate Identity Style Manual* or guide to address these more mechanical considerations.

Although parts of the brand charter may not change from year to year, the firm should nevertheless update it on an annual basis to provide decision makers with a current brand profile and to identify new opportunities and potential risks for the brand. As marketers introduce new products, change brand programs, and conduct other marketing initiatives, they should reflect these adequately in the brand charter. Many of the in-depth insights that emerge from brand audits also belong in the charter.

Skype’s brand bible, for example, outlines the branding and image of its products and services.[13] The document clearly states how Skype wants to be seen by consumers, how the firm uses its branding to achieve that, and why this is important. It also explains how Skype’s logo of clouds and the vivid blue color are designed to make clean lines and foster a creative and simple look. The brand bible explains the “do’s and don’ts” of marketing Skype’s products and services and the dangers for the company image of working outside the brand guidelines.
