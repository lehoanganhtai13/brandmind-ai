# URLs

Anyone wishing to own a specific URL must register and pay for the name. As companies clamored for space on the Web, the number of registered URLs increased dramatically. Every three-letter combination and virtually all words in a typical English dictionary have been registered. The sheer volume of registered URLs often makes it necessary for companies to use coined words for new brands if they wish to have a Web site for the brand. For example, when Andersen Consulting selected its new name, it chose the coined word “Accenture” in part because the URL www.accenture.com had not been registered.

Another issue facing companies with regard to URLs is protecting their brands from unauthorized use in other domain names. A company can sue the current owner of the URL for copyright infringement, buy the name from the current owner, or register all conceivable variations of its brand as domain names ahead of time.

In 2010, cybersquatting cases reached record levels. *Cybersquatting* or *domain squatting*, as defined by government law, is registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. Under such cases, trademark holders sue for infringement of their domain names through the WIPO (an agency of the UN).

The top five areas of legal activity initiated by companies are in the retail, banking and finance, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, Internet and IT, and fashion industries. In 2009, Citibank successfully filed suit against Shui of China under the Anticybersquatting and Consumer Protection Act by showing that (1) Shui had a bad-faith intent to profit from using the domain name citybank.org; and (2) that the name was confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, Citibank’s distinctive or famous mark. Shui was forced to pay Citibank $100,000 and its legal fees.

Many sources list the current total of registered domain names at or close to the 200 million mark. As the domain name market has exploded, ICANN—a nonprofit that governs the industry—announced it would begin accepting applications to register customized and unlimited URLs. This decision could have a significant impact for companies, which can now register brand URLs. Canon and Hitachi were among the first brands to apply to register their brand names under the new top-level domain policy.

Brand recall is critical for URLs because it increases the likelihood that consumers easily remember the URL to get to the site. At the peak of the Internet boom, investors paid $7.5 million for Business.com, $2.2 million for Autos.com, and $1.1 million for Bingo.com. Many of these “common noun” sites failed, however, and were criticized, among other things, for having names that were too generic. Many firms adopted names that started with a lowercase *e* or *i* and ended in “net,” “systems,” or, especially, “com.” Most of these names became liabilities after the Internet bubble burst, forcing firms such as Internet.com to revert to a more conventional name, INTMedia Group.

Yahoo!, however, was able to create a memorable brand and URL. Jerry Yang and David Filo named their Internet portal (created as a Stanford University thesis project) “Yahoo!” after thumbing through the dictionary for words that began with “ya,” the universal computing acronym for “yet another.” Filo stumbled upon *yahoo*, which brought back fond childhood memories of his father calling him “little yahoo.” Liking the name, they created a more complete acronym: “Yet another hierarchical officious oracle.”

Typically, for an existing brand, the main URL is a straightforward and maybe even literal translation of the brand name, like www.shell.com, although there are some exceptions and variations, such as www.purplepill.com for the Nexium acid-reflux medication Web site.

# Logos and Symbols

Although the brand name typically is the central element of the brand, visual elements also play a critical role in building brand equity and especially brand awareness. **Logos** have a long history as a means to indicate origin, ownership, or association. For example, families and countries have used logos for centuries to visually represent their names (think of the Hapsburg eagle of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

Logos range from corporate names or trademarks (word marks with text only) written in a distinctive form, to entirely abstract designs that may be completely unrelated to the word mark, corporate name, or corporate activities.
