## 5. Do the “Right Thing” with Brands

Many consumers believe companies should help benefit local communities, society as a whole, and the broader natural environment. At the same time, heightened scrutiny from the investment community has caused many companies to adopt an overly myopic short-term planning horizon for their brands. Brand marketers need to address both these marketplace realities.

### Cause Marketing.

Brand marketers must embrace social responsibility and ethically and morally proper behavior at all times. In particular, they need to find win–win solutions with cause marketing programs and other activities that allow them to enhance the welfare of consumers, society, or the environment while still profitably running their businesses. Effective cause marketing programs can accomplish a number of objectives for a brand: build brand awareness, enhance brand image, establish brand credibility, evoke brand feelings, create a sense of brand community, and elicit brand engagement.

A classic example of a successful cause marketing program is supplied by Tesco, a leading U.K. retailer. Its “Tesco for Schools and Clubs” program dovetails well with its overall corporate brand positioning of “Every Little Helps.” Customers receive one voucher for every £10 spent, which they can donate to any school of their choice or any registered amateur club catering for children under the age of 18. In 2009, the company gave away 540,000 items worth £13.4 million. Tesco also gives vouchers for inkjet cartridges that are recycled and old working phones that are donated.

### Protecting Brand Equity.

Doing the right things with brands sometimes means doing something even simpler and more straight-forward: protecting and respecting the brand promise and meaning to consumers. Pepsi’s recent packaging redesigns for Gatorade, Pepsi, and especially Tropicana, for example, were all criticized to varying degrees as not being faithful to the equity of those brands. When Tropicana dropped the familiar straw-in-the-orange image on the front of its packaging, negative public feedback forced the company to revert to its original packaging.

Overexposing, overextending, overmodernizing, overdiscounting—there are many ways to take advantage of a brand. The best and most widely admired marketers treat their brands with understanding and respect and a clear sense of commercial and social purpose. They take their brands on a well-mapped-out journey that allows them to profitably grow while preserving close bonds with consumers and benefits to society as a whole. Disney launched an internal brand mantra of “fun family entertainment” to help employees judge whether any marketing or other action was “on brand.” The worry was not that any single decision would be fatal or even damaging to the brand, but that a number of little concessions and compromises would eventually add up to significantly erode the equity of the Disney brand.
