This table presents a comparative overview of notable individuals and events across several distinct domains: Artists, Explorers, Golfers, and Racing. The Artists category lists prominent musicians and opera houses, while Explorers highlights individuals known for their achievements in mountaineering and deep-sea exploration, alongside specific expeditions. Golfers features renowned players and major championships, and Racing encompasses various motorsport events and celebrated drivers, as well as tennis players and tournaments, and finally, skiing athletes and races. The structure is a straightforward categorization, allowing for a direct comparison of prominent figures and significant events within each field.

Aligning with acclaimed artists symbolizes the pursuit of perfection. Association with elite sports figures is meant to signify the company’s quest for excellence. Its support of sailing events, for example, highlights the company’s core values: excellence, precision, and team spirit.  
Explorers also test the excellence and innovation of Rolex’s watches at extreme conditions. Rolex ambassadors have scaled Mt. Everest, broken the speed of sound, reached the depths of the ocean, and traveled in space. A print ad will usually feature one ambassador and one specific watch, with the goal of targeting a very specific demographic or consumer group.

In 2011, much to the surprise of industry experts, Rolex signed golfer Tiger Woods as a Rolex ambassador. Woods has had a long and complicated history as a celebrity endorser of watches. In 1997, just after he turned pro, Rolex’s Tudor watch signed him to a partnership that lasted almost five years. Woods backed out of the contract in 2002 to sign with rival Tag Heuer, which paid him approximately $2 million annually. Woods rationalized his decision to end ties with Tudor by explaining, “My tastes have changed,” and that he didn’t “feel a connection with that company.”  
In 2009, the tables turned when Tag Heuer announced it had ended the relationship following Woods’s involvement in a sex scandal.

Rolex’s sponsorship marked the golfer’s first celebrity endorsement since 2009. The company said it was “convinced that Tiger Woods still has a long career ahead of him and that he has all the qualities required to continue to mark the history of golf. The brand is committed to accompanying him in his new challenges . . . This association pays tribute to the exceptional stature of Tiger Woods and the leading role he plays in forging the sport’s global appeal. It also constitutes a joint commitment to the future.”

**Sports and Culture.**  
Rolex sponsors a variety of elite athletic and cultural events to reinforce the same messages, values, and associations as it does through its ambassador endorsements. These include a quest for excellence, pursuit of perfection, teamwork, and ruggedness. Rolex sponsors sporting events in golf (U.S. Open Championship, the Open Championship, and the Ryder Cup), tennis (Wimbledon and the Australian Open), skiing (the Hahnenkamm Races), racing (Rolex 24 at Daytona), and equestrian events.

Rolex also sponsors several sailing races, including the Rolex Sydney, Rolex Fastnet Race, and Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup. The company has partnered with extreme exploration expeditions, including The Deepest Dive and Deepsea Under the Pole. It is a major contributor to establishments such as the Royal Opera House in London and the Teatro alla Scala in Milan to align with a more cultural audience.

**Philanthropy.**  
Rolex gives back through three established philanthropic programs:

1. The *Awards for Enterprise* program supports individuals whose work focuses on benefiting their communities and the world. These projects are focused on science and health, applied technology, exploration and discovery, the environment, and cultural heritage.

2. The *Young Laureates Programme* is part of the Awards for Enterprise program, providing support for outstanding innovators between the ages of 18 and 30.

3. The *Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative* seeks out extraordinarily gifted young artists around the world and pairs them with established masters. Young artists have been paired with accomplished filmmakers, dancers, artists, composers, and actors.
