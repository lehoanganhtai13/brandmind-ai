Two important and enduring branding lessons emerged from the Marlboro episode. First, strong brands can command price premiums. Once Marlboro’s price entered a more acceptable range, consumers were willing to pay the still-higher price, and sales of the brand started to increase. Second, strong brands cannot command an excessive price premium. The clear signal sent to marketers everywhere is that price hikes without corresponding investments in the value of the brand may increase the vulnerability of the brand to lower-priced competition. In these cases, consumers may be willing to “trade down” because they no longer can justify to themselves that the higher-priced brand is worth it. Although the Marlboro price discounts led to short-term profitability declines, they also led to regained market share that put the brand on a stronger footing over the longer haul.

In today’s challenging new climate, several firms have been successful by adopting a value-pricing strategy. For example, Walmart’s slogan, “Save Money. Live Better,” describes the pricing strategy that has allowed it to become the world’s largest retailer. Southwest Airlines combined low fares with no-frills—but friendly—service to become a powerful force in the airline industry. The success of these and other firms has dramatized the potential benefits of implementing a value-pricing strategy.

As you might expect, there are a number of opinions regarding the keys for success in adopting a value-based pricing approach. In general, however, an effective value-pricing strategy should strike the proper balance among three key components:

* Product design and delivery  
* Product costs  
* Product prices  

In other words, as we’ve seen before, the right kind of product has to be made the right way and sold at the right price. We look at each of these three elements below. Meanwhile, a brand that has experienced much success in recent years balancing this formula is Hyundai.

## HYUNDAI

Taking a page from the Samsung playbook, Korean upstart automaker Hyundai is trying to do to Toyota and Honda what Samsung successfully did to Sony—provide an affordable alternative to a popular market leader. Like Samsung, Hyundai has adopted a well-executed value pricing strategy that combines advanced technology, reliable performance, and attractive design with lower prices. As the head of U.S. design noted in discussing the 2011 Sonata sedan and revamped Tucson crossover, “The basic idea is a car that looks like a premium car, but not at a premium price. We’re looking to pull people out of Camrys and Accords and give them something different.” Hyundai’s 10-year or 100,000 mile power train warranty programs and positive reviews from car analysts such as J. D. Power provided additional reassurance to potential buyers of the quality of the products and the company’s stability. To maintain momentum during the recession, Hyundai’s “Assurance” program, featuring a highly publicized Super Bowl TV spot, allowed new buyers to return their Hyundai vehicles if they lost their job.
