**Communicating Value.**  
Combining these three components in the right way to create value is crucial. Just delivering good value, however, is necessary but not sufficient for achieving pricing success—consumers have to actually understand and appreciate the value of the brand. In many cases, that value may be obvious—the product or service benefits are clear and comparisons with competitors are easy. In other cases, however, value may not be obvious, and consumers may too easily default to purchasing lower-priced competitors. Then marketers may need to engage in marketing communications to help consumers better recognize the value. In some cases, the solution may simply require straightforward communications that expand on the value equation for the brand, such as stressing quality for price. In other cases, it may involve “framing” and convincing consumers to think about their brand and product decisions differently.  

For example, take a premium-priced brand such as Procter & Gamble’s Pantene. It faces pressure from many competing brands, but especially private-label and store and discount brands that may cost much less. In tough times, even small cost savings may matter to penny-pinching consumers. Assume a bottle of Pantene cost a $1 more than its main competitors but could be used for up to 100 shampoos. In that case, the price difference is really only one cent *per shampoo*. By framing the purchase decision in terms of cost per shampoo, P&G could then advertise, “Isn’t it worth a penny more to get a better-looking head of hair?”

### Price Segmentation.  
At the same time, different consumers may have different value perceptions and therefore could—and most likely should—receive different prices. Price segmentation sets and adjusts prices for appropriate market segments. Apple has a three-tier pricing scheme for iTunes downloads—a base price of 99 cents, but $1.29 for popular hits and 69 cents for oldies-but-not-so-goodies.<sup>58</sup> Starbucks similarly has raised the prices of some of its specialty beverages while charging less for some basic drinks.<sup>59</sup>  

In part because of wide adoption of the Internet, firms are increasingly employing *yield management principles* or *dynamic pricing*, such as those adopted by airlines to vary their prices for different market segments according to their different demand and value perceptions. Here are several examples:  
* Allstate Insurance embarked on a yield management pricing program, looking at drivers’ credit history, demographic profile, and other factors to better match automobile policy premiums to customer risk profiles.<sup>60</sup>  
* To better compete with scalpers and online ticket brokers such as StubHub, concert giant Ticketmaster has begun to implement more efficient variable pricing schemes based on demand that charge higher prices for the most sought-after tickets and lower prices for less-desirable seats for sporting events and concerts.<sup>61</sup>  
* The San Francisco Giants now uses a software system that allows the team to look at different variables such as current ticket sales, weather forecasts, and pitching matchups to determine whether it should adjust prices—right up until game day. The software allows the team to take the price-tier strategy baseball has traditionally used and make it more dynamic.<sup>62</sup>  
* New start-up Village Vines offers a demand-management solution to restaurants that allows them to effectively price discriminate by offering deal-prone customers the option of making reservations for 30 percent off the entire bill on select (less desirable) days and times.<sup>63</sup>  

### Everyday Low Pricing.  
*Everyday low pricing (EDLP)* has received increased attention as a means of determining price discounts and promotions over time. EDLP avoids the sawtooth, whiplash pattern of alternating price increases and decreases or discounts in favor of a more consistent set of “everyday” base prices on products. In many cases, these EDLP prices are based on the value-pricing considerations we’ve noted above.

### The P&G Experience.  
In the early 1990s, Procter & Gamble made a well-publicized conversion to EDLP.<sup>64</sup> By reducing list prices on half its brands and eliminating many temporary discounts, P&G reported that it saved $175 million in 1991, or 10 percent of its previous year’s profits. Advocates of EDLP argue that maintaining consistently low prices on major items every day helps build brand loyalty, fend off private-label inroads, and reduce manufacturing and inventory costs.<sup>65</sup> The San Francisco Giants have used yield pricing at their AT&T Park home, basing prices for any seat at any game on a number of different factors.
