# KINDLE

Amazon revolutionized book retailing with the launch of its online book-selling service, “Earth’s Largest Bookstore.” The company has transcended its bookseller roots and now sells millions of goods and services of all kinds, from simple toys to high-definition televisions, as it continues to fine-tune its appealing combination of wide selection, helpful service, and low prices. Years of product development led to the launch of the revolutionary Kindle e-reader, with which customers could also shop for and purchase e-books and other digital media via wireless networking. Consistent with Amazon’s business strategy, Kindle was priced increasingly lower with each successive generation. Subsequent models were also thinner and lighter than previous versions, with faster page turns, sharper resolution, and improved readability. When Apple launched its iPad in April 2010 and many forecast the demise of the Kindle, sales of the e-reader in fact accelerated. Amazon’s sales of e-books quickly eclipsed those of hardcover and paperback books. By the end of 2011, Amazon was selling over 1 million products in the Kindle family per week. The brand’s success had paved the way for the company to extend it into the red-hot tablet market. Kindle Fire became Amazon’s most successful new product launch ever and was the most popular gift and top best seller for the 2011 holiday season. With Kindle, Amazon has established a classic power brand with many growth opportunities.³²

These brands all created their own associations and image and tapped into markets completely different from those that currently existed for other brands sold by the company. Thus, introducing a new product as a brand extension can have significant and potentially hidden costs in terms of the lost opportunities of creating a new brand franchise. The extension’s brand positioning may be less flexible, too, given that it has to live up to the parent brand’s promise and image. The positioning of a new brand, in contrast, could be introduced and updated in the most competitively advantageous way possible.

## UNDERSTANDING HOW CONSUMERS EVALUATE BRAND EXTENSIONS

What determines whether a brand extension is able to capitalize on potential advantages and avoid, or at least minimize, potential disadvantages? Figure 12-5 displays some examples of successful and unsuccessful brand extensions through the years. Note how even leading marketing companies have sometimes failed despite their best intentions when launching a brand extension.

This section examines how consumers evaluate brand extensions and develops some ideas to help marketing managers better forecast and improve the odds for success of a brand extension.³³ **FIGURE 12-5**
