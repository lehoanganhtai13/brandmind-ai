This figure outlines the key factors involved in designing effective advertising campaigns, drawing from a framework by Rossiter and Percy. The design process is presented as a structured approach, emphasizing the strategic considerations necessary for successful advertising. While the table itself does not detail the specific factors, it indicates that the subsequent figure or text will elaborate on these elements, likely covering aspects such as target audience identification, message development, media selection, and campaign evaluation. The overarching structure appears to be a conceptual model guiding the systematic creation of advertising initiatives.

Chapter 3 described a number of issues with respect to positioning strategies to maximize brand equity. Creative strategies tend to be either largely *informational*, elaborating on a specific product-related attribute or benefit, or largely *transformational*, portraying a specific non-product-related benefit or image.<sup>10</sup> These two general categories each encompass several different specific creative approaches.

Regardless of which general creative approach marketers take, however, certain motivational or “borrowed interest” devices can attract consumers’ attention and raise their involvement with an ad. These devices include cute babies, frisky puppies, popular music, well-liked celebrities, amusing situations, provocative sex appeals, and fear-inducing threats. Many believe such techniques are necessary in the tough new media environment characterized by low-involvement consumer processing and much competing ad and programming clutter.

Unfortunately, these attention-getting tactics are often *too* effective and distract from the brand or its product claims. Thus, the challenge in arriving at the best creative strategy is figuring out how to break through the clutter to attract the attention of consumers by offering a creative, consistent, and unique message. Etisalat’s “More to Life” campaign in Egypt presents an exemplary case.
