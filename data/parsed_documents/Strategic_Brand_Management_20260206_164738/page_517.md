# MASTERCARD
MasterCard quickly evolved its successful “Priceless” campaign, launched in 1996, into a “worldwide platform.” By 1998, the tagline, “The best things in life are free. For everything else, there’s MasterCard” was in use in over 30 countries. Some ads’ premises were universal enough to work as is, with only language translation, such as the “Zipper” ad, in which the priceless moment is a man realizing his zipper is down before anyone else does. In other cases, a locally relevant premise was used instead, with the same tagline. “Every culture has those meaningful moments, which is why we’ve been able to globalize the campaign,” stated a creative director for McCann Erickson, which developed the campaign. Sponsorships for sports with international appeal, such as World Cup soccer and Formula 1 racing, also increased the campaign’s ability to connect with a worldwide audience. The campaign was credited with lifting brand awareness in a number of nations, driving card sales, and enabling MasterCard to take market share from Visa. Over 15 years later, the campaign is still running strong.¹⁹

# DISADVANTAGES OF GLOBAL MARKETING PROGRAMS
Perhaps the most compelling disadvantage of standardized global marketing programs is that they often ignore fundamental differences of various kinds across countries and cultures (see Figure 14-2). Critics claim that designing one program for all possible markets results in unimaginative and ineffective strategies geared to the lowest common denominator. Possible differences across countries come in a host of forms, as we discuss next.

## Differences in Consumer Needs, Wants, and Usage Patterns for Products
Differences in cultural values, economic development, and other factors across nationalities lead customers to behave very differently. For example, the per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages varies dramatically from country to country: in liters consumed per capita annually, the Czech Republic (8.51) and Ireland (7.04) drink the most beer; France (8.14) and Portugal (6.65) drink the most wine; and South Korea (9.57) and Russia (6.88) drink the most distilled spirits.²⁰

Product strategies that work in one country may not work in another. Tupperware, which makes the bulk of its annual sales overseas—57 percent from emerging markets—needed to adjust its products to satisfy different consumer behavior. In India, a plastic container paired with a spoon becomes a “masala keeper” for spices. In Korea, stain-resistant canisters are ideal for kimchi fermentation. Larger boxes work as safe, airtight “kimono keepers” in Japan. In France, its more expensive cookware line does much better than in the United States, where customers buy more plastic containers. Tupperware parties in France feature cooking lessons more than selling. India has followed suit, introducing the stylish Ultimo line of kitchenware.²¹

## Differences in Consumer Response to Branding Elements
Linguistic differences across countries can twist or change the meaning of a brand name. Sound systems that differ across dialects can make a word problematic in one country but not another. Cultural context is key. Customers may actually respond well to a name with potentially problematic associations. The questions are how widespread the association is, how immediate it is, and how problematic it actually would be.

Well-known brand consultancy Lexicon employs linguists to help make these assessments for clients.²² The agency has uncovered names that would have been a sexual insult in

Figure 14-2 outlines the disadvantages encountered when implementing global marketing programs, highlighting various areas of divergence. These disadvantages stem from differences in consumer behavior, including their needs, wants, usage patterns, and responses to branding and marketing mix elements. Furthermore, disparities exist in product and brand development, as well as in the competitive landscape across different markets. The legal environment and the nature of marketing institutions also present challenges. Finally, differences in administrative procedures represent another significant hurdle in global marketing efforts. The figure thus presents a comparative structure, detailing distinct categories of differences that complicate standardized global marketing strategies. Tupperware party in Indonesia.
