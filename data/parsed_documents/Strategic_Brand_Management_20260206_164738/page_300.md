# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 8-1

## The Role of Brand Personas

**Personas** are detailed profiles of one, or perhaps a few, target market consumers. They are often defined in terms of demographic, psychographic, geographic, or other descriptive attitudinal or behavioral information. Researchers may use photos, images, names, or short bios to help convey the particulars of the persona.

The rationale behind personas is to provide exemplars or archetypes of how the target customer looks, acts, and feels that are as true-to-life as possible, to ensure marketers within the organization fully understand and appreciate their target market and therefore incorporate a nuanced target customer point of view in all their marketing decision-making. Personas are fundamentally designed to bring the target consumer to life.

A good brand persona can guide all marketing activities. Burger King’s brand persona is a cool, youngish uncle, who—although somewhat older than the chain’s early-teens male target—is younger than their parents. The corresponding brand voice appears online, in ads and promotions, and wherever the brand expresses itself.

Although personas can provide a very detailed and accessible perspective on the target market, it can come at a cost. Overly focusing on a narrow slice of the target market can lead to oversimplification and erroneous assumptions about how the target market as a whole thinks, feels, or acts. The more heterogeneity in the target market, the more problematic the use of personas can be.

To overcome the potential problem of overgeneralization, some firms are creating multiple personas to provide a richer tapestry of the target market. There can also be varying levels of personas, such as primary (target consumer), secondary (target consumer with differing needs, targets, goals), and negative (false stereotypes of users).

Marketing partners like the marketing research suppliers and ad agency team. Once marketers have a good understanding from the brand audit of current brand knowledge structures for their target consumers and have decided on the desired brand knowledge structures for optimal positioning, they may still want to do additional research testing alternative tactical programs to achieve that positioning.

This table presents a comparative analysis of "Reality" versus "Objective" states, centered around the concept of "Brand Equity." In the current "Reality," customers are "Owned," implying a transactional or captive relationship, while competition is "Claimed," suggesting a focus on asserting market position. The "Objective" future state, however, envisions a shift towards customers being "Valued," indicating a move towards customer-centricity and relationship building. Concurrently, competition is to be "Desired," signifying a strategic aspiration to be the preferred choice in the market. This framework outlines a progression from a present, possession-based approach to a future, relationship-driven strategy aimed at enhancing Brand Equity.
