4. *Brand Attachment:* The degree of loyalty the customer feels toward the brand. A strong form of attachment, *adherence,* is the consumer’s resistance to change and the ability of a brand to withstand bad news like a product or service failure. In the extreme, attachment can even become *addiction.*

5. *Brand Activity:* The extent to which customers use the brand, talk to others about the brand, seek out brand information, promotions, and events, and so on.

These five dimensions can be easily related to the brand resonance model (awareness relates to salience, associations relate to performance and imagery, attitudes relate to judgments and feelings, and attachment and activity relate to resonance). As in the resonance model, an obvious hierarchy exists in the dimensions of value: awareness supports associations, which drive attitudes that lead to attachment and activity. Brand value is created at this stage when customers have (1) deep, broad brand awareness; (2) appropriately strong, favorable, and unique points-of-parity and points-of-difference; (3) positive brand judgments and feelings; (4) intense brand attachment and loyalty; and (5) a high degree of brand activity.

Creating the right customer mind-set can be critical in terms of building brand equity and value. AMD and Cyrix found that achieving performance parity with Intel’s microprocessors did not return benefits in 1998, when original equipment manufacturers were reluctant to adopt the new chips because of their lack of a strong brand image with consumers. Moreover, success with consumers may not translate to success in the marketplace unless other conditions also prevail. The ability of this customer mind-set to create value at the next stage depends on external factors we call the marketplace conditions multiplier, as follows.

*Marketplace Conditions Multiplier.*  
The extent to which value created in the minds of customers affects market performance depends on factors beyond the individual customer. Three such factors are:

1. *Competitive superiority:* How effective are the marketing investments of competing brands?  
2. *Channel and other intermediary support:* How much brand reinforcement and selling effort is being put forth by various marketing partners?  
3. *Customer size and profile:* How many and what types of customers are attracted to the brand? Are they profitable?

The value created in the minds of customers will translate to favorable market performance when competitors fail to provide a significant threat, when channel members and other intermediaries provide strong support, and when a sizable number of profitable customers are attracted to the brand.

The competitive context faced by a brand can have a profound effect on its fortunes. For example, Nike and McDonald’s have benefited in the past from the prolonged marketing woes of their main rivals, Reebok and Burger King, which both have suffered from numerous repositionings and management changes. On the other hand, MasterCard has had to contend for the past decade with two strong, well-marketed brands in Visa and American Express and consequently has faced an uphill battle gaining market share despite its well-received “Priceless” ad campaign, as described earlier in this chapter.

*Market Performance.*  
We saw in Chapter 2 that the customer mind-set affects how customers react in the marketplace in six main ways. The first two relate to price premiums and price elasticities. How much extra are customers willing to pay for a comparable product because of its brand? And how much does their demand increase or decrease when the price rises or falls? A third outcome is market share, which measures the success of the marketing program in driving brand sales. Taken together, the first three outcomes determine the direct revenue stream attributable to the brand over time. Brand value is created with higher market shares, greater price premiums, and more elastic responses to price decreases and inelastic responses to price increases.

The fourth outcome is brand expansion, the success of the brand in supporting line and category extensions and new-product launches into related categories. This dimension captures the brand’s ability to add enhancements to the revenue stream. The fifth outcome is cost structure or, more specifically, reduced marketing program expenditures thanks to the prevailing customer mind-set. When customers already have favorable opinions and knowledge about a brand, any aspect of the marketing program is likely to be more effective for the same expenditure level;
