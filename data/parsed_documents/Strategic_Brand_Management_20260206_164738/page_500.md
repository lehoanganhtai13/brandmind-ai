Updating a brand may require some combination of new products, new advertising, new promotions, and new packaging. Reaching its 100th birthday in 2013, Clorox is a heritage brand that must periodically take steps to update itself. To reach young parents on the go, it developed the myStain smartphone app dedicated to stain removal. Family-oriented images, such as photos of kids’ faces covered with spaghetti sauce, were included to make the app more accessible and fun. Many solutions offered convenient alternatives to Clorox products, such as seltzer water as a stain treatment in a restaurant.²²

**Changing Brand Elements.** Often we must change one or more brand elements either to convey new information or to signal that the brand has taken on new meaning because the product or some other aspect of the marketing program has changed. The brand name is typically the most important brand element, and it’s often the most difficult to change. Nevertheless, we can drop names or combine them into initials to reflect shifts in marketing strategy or to ease pronounceability and recall. Shortened names or initials can also minimize potentially negative product associations.

For example, Federal Express chose to officially shorten its name to FedEx and introduce a new logo to acknowledge what consumers were actually calling the brand.²³ In an attempt to convey a healthier image, Kentucky Fried Chicken abbreviated its name to the initials KFC. The company also introduced a new logo incorporating the character of Colonel Sanders as a means of maintaining tradition but also modernizing its appeal. When the company began to emphasize grilled chicken and sandwiches in its national advertising over the traditional bone-in fried offerings though, some franchisees actually sued, saying the brand had strayed too far from its roots.²⁴

It is easier to change other brand elements, and we may need to, especially if they play an important awareness or image function. Chapter 4 described how to modify and update packaging, logos, and characters over time. We noted there that changes generally should be moderate and evolutionary, and marketers must take great care to preserve the most salient aspects of the brand elements.

# ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BRAND PORTFOLIO

Managing brand equity and the brand portfolio requires taking a long-term view and carefully considering the role of different brands in the portfolio and their relationships over time. Sometimes a brand refresh just requires cleaning up the brand architecture.

When P&G saw sales slump for its $3-billion-in-revenue Pantene hair care brand during the recession of 2008, the company engaged in a massive research and development process to improve and revamp the product line. Extensive consumer testing and technologies typically employed for medical and space research were used to examine how different ingredients interacted with various hair types to develop new and improved products. P&G reduced the number of its shampoos, conditioners, and styling aids by one-third and reorganized and color-coded the entire product line around four specific hair types: color-treated, curly, fine, and medium-to-thick.²⁵

### Migration Strategies

The *brand migration strategy* helps consumers understand how various brands in the portfolio can satisfy their needs as they change over time, or as the products and brands themselves change over time. Managing brand transitions is especially important in rapidly changing, technologically intensive markets. Ideally, brands will be organized in consumers’ minds so they know at least implicitly how they can switch among them as their needs or desires change.

A corporate or family branding strategy in which brands are ordered in a logical manner could provide the hierarchical structure in consumers’ minds to facilitate brand migration. Car companies are quite sensitive to this issue, and brands such as BMW—with its 3-, 5- and 7-series numbering systems to denote increasingly higher levels of quality—are good examples. Chrysler designated Plymouth as its “starter” car line and expected Plymouth owners to trade up later to higher-priced Chrysler models.

### Acquiring New Customers

All firms face trade-offs between attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. In mature markets, trial is generally less important than building loyalty and retaining existing customers.
