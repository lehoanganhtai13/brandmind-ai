## Tactical Guidelines

Chapter 1 highlighted the chief ingredients of the CBBE framework in terms of how to build, measure, and manage brand equity. The specific themes and recommendations we developed in subsequent chapters are as follows.

### Building Brand Equity

Tactically, we can build brand equity in three major ways: (1) through the initial choice of the brand elements making up the brand, (2) through marketing activities and the design of the marketing program, and (3) through the leverage of secondary associations that link the brand to other entities like a company, geographic region, other brand, person, or event. Guidelines emerged in Chapters 4–7 for each of these approaches, as summarized in Figures 15-3 and 15-4.

This table outlines a hierarchical framework for brand building, detailing tools, objectives, and their effects on consumer knowledge and overall branding benefits. The process begins with **Choosing Brand Elements** such as names, logos, and slogans, which aim to achieve memorability, meaningfulness, appeal, transferability, adaptability, and protectability. These elements contribute to **Brand Awareness**, encompassing depth (recall and recognition) and breadth (purchase and consumption). Concurrently, **Developing Marketing Programs** involves strategic decisions regarding product, price, distribution, and communications, which are intended to foster **Brand Associations** that are strong, favorable, and unique. Finally, **Leverage of Secondary Associations**, including company, country of origin, and endorsers, further supports awareness, meaningfulness, and transferability. The ultimate **Branding Benefits** derived from these efforts include greater loyalty, reduced vulnerability to competition, larger margins, more elastic price responses, increased trade cooperation, enhanced marketing efficiency, licensing opportunities, and favorable brand extension evaluations.
