Ensuring that the organization retain at least some of the equity that employees (especially senior ones) build is thus crucial in case any of them leave.  
Referrals and testimonials can be powerful when the services offered are highly intangible and subjective. Emotions also play a big role in terms of sense of security and social approval. Switching costs can be significant and pose barriers to entry for competitors, but clients do have the opportunity to bargain and will often do so to acquire more customized solutions.

### Retailers and Distributors  
To retailers and other channel members distributing products, brands provide a number of important functions. Brands can generate consumer interest, patronage, and loyalty in a store, as consumers learn to expect certain brands and products. To the extent “you are what you sell,” brands help retailers create an image and establish positioning. Retailers can also create their own brand image by attaching unique associations to the quality of their service, their product assortment and merchandising, and their pricing and credit policy. Finally, the appeal and attraction of brands, whether manufacturers’ brands or the retailers’ own brands, can yield higher price margins, increased sales volumes, and greater profits.  
Retailers can introduce their own brands by using their store name, creating new names, or some combination of the two. Many distributors, especially in Europe, have actually introduced their own brands, which they sell in addition to—or sometimes even instead of—manufacturers’ brands. Products bearing these *store brands* or *private label* brands offer another way for retailers to increase customer loyalty and generate higher margins and profits.  
By mid-July 2009, private labels accounted for 17 percent of grocery purchases in food, drug, and mass merchandisers in North America.<sup>22</sup> In Britain, five or six grocery chains selling their own brands account for roughly half the country’s food and packaged-goods sales, led by Sainsbury and Tesco. Another top British retailer, Marks & Spencer, sells only its own-brand goods, under the label of St. Michael. Several U.S. retailers also emphasize their own brands. (Chapter 5 considers store brands and private labels in greater detail.)  
The Internet has transformed retailing in recent years as retailers have adopted a “bricks and clicks” approach to their business or, in many cases, become pure-play online retailers, operating only on the Web. Regardless of the exact form, to be competitive online, many retailers have had to improve their online service by making customer service agents available in real time, shipping products promptly, providing tracking updates, and adopting liberal return policies.

### Online Products and Services  
Some of the strongest brands in recent years have been born online. Google, Facebook, and Twitter are three notable examples. That wasn’t always the case. At the onset of the Internet, many online marketers made serious—and sometimes fatal—mistakes. Some oversimplified the branding process, equating flashy or unusual advertising with building a brand. Although such marketing efforts sometimes caught consumers’ attention, more often than not they failed to create awareness of what products or services the brand represented, why those products or services were unique or different, and most important, why consumers should visit their Web site.  
Online marketers now realize the realities of brand building. First, as for any brand, it is critical to create unique aspects of the brand on some dimension that is important to consumers, such as convenience, price, or variety. At the same time, the brand needs to perform satisfactorily in other areas, such as customer service, credibility, and personality. For instance, customers increasingly began to demand higher levels of service both during and after their Web site visits.  
Successful online brands have been well positioned and have found unique ways to satisfy consumers’ unmet needs. By offering unique features and services to consumers, the best online brands are able to avoid extensive advertising or lavish marketing campaigns, relying more on word-of-mouth and publicity.
