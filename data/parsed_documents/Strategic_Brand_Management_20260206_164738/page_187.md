By eliciting consumer cooperation in this manner, marketers *might* develop stronger relationships with consumers so that they desire to receive further communications in the future. Those relationships will only develop, however, if marketers respect consumers’ wishes, and if consumers express a willingness to become more involved with the brand.²²

With the help of large databases and advanced software, companies can store gigabytes of customer data and process this information in order to send targeted, personalized marketing e-mail messages to customers. Godin identifies five steps to effective permission marketing:

1. **Offer the prospect an incentive to volunteer.**  
2. **Offer the interested prospect a curriculum over time, teaching the consumer about the product or service being marketed.**  
3. **Reinforce the incentive to guarantee that the prospect maintains his or her permission.**  
4. **Offer additional incentives to get more permission from the consumer.**  
5. **Over time, leverage the permission to change consumer behavior toward profits.**

In Godin’s view, effective permission marketing works because it is “anticipated, personal, and relevant.” A recent consumer research study provides some support: 87 percent of respondents agreed that e-mail “is a great way for me to hear about new products available from retail companies”; 88 percent of respondents said a retailer’s e-mail has prompted them to download/print out a coupon; 75 percent said it has led them to buy a product online; 67 percent said it has prompted an offline purchase; and 60 percent have been moved to “try a new product for the first time.”²³ Amazon.com has successfully applied permission marketing on the Web for years.²⁴

### AMAZON

With customer permission, online retailer Amazon uses database software to track its customers’ purchase habits and send them personalized marketing messages. Each time a customer purchases something from Amazon.com, he or she can receive a follow-up e-mail containing information about other products that might interest him or her based on that purchase. For example, if a customer buys a book, Amazon might send an e-mail containing a list of titles by the same author, or of titles also purchased by customers who bought the original title. With just one click, the customer can get more detailed information. Amazon also sends periodic e-mails to customers informing them of new products, special offers, and sales. Each message is tailored to the individual customer based on past purchases and specified preferences, according to customer wishes. Amazon keeps an exhaustive list of past purchases for each customer and makes extensive recommendations.

Permission marketing is a way of developing the “consumer dialogue” component of one-to-one marketing in more detail. One drawback to permission marketing, however, is that it presumes that consumers have some sense of what they want. In many cases, consumers have undefined, ambiguous, or conflicting preferences that might be difficult for them to express. Thus, marketers must recognize that consumers may need to be given guidance and assistance in forming and conveying their preferences. In that regard, *participation marketing* may be a more appropriate term and concept to employ, because marketers and consumers need to work together to find out how the firm can best satisfy consumer goals.²⁵

## Reconciling the Different Marketing Approaches

These and other different approaches to personalization help reinforce a number of important marketing concepts and techniques. From a branding point of view, they are particularly useful means of both eliciting positive brand responses and creating brand resonance to build customer-based brand equity. Mass customization and one-to-one and permission marketing are all potentially effective means of getting consumers more actively engaged with a brand.

According to the customer-based brand equity (CBBE) model, however, these different approaches emphasize different aspects of brand equity. For example, mass customization and one-to-one and permission marketing might be particularly effective at creating greater relevance, stronger behavioral loyalty, and attitudinal attachment.
