*Aided recall* uses various types of cues to help consumer recall.  
One possible sequence of aided recall might use progressively narrower cues—such as product class, product category, and product type labels—to provide insight into the organization of consumers’ brand knowledge structures.

For example, if recall of the Porsche 911—a high-performance German sports car—in non-German markets were of interest, recall probes could begin with “all cars” and move to more and more narrowly defined categories such as “sports cars,” “foreign sports cars,” or even “high-performance German sports cars.” Marketers could ask consumers: “When you think of foreign sports cars, which brands come to mind?”

Other types of cues can help measure brand recall. For example, marketers can ask about product attributes (“When you think of chocolate, which brands come to mind?) or usage goals (“If you were thinking of having a healthy snack, which brands come to mind?”). Often, to capture the breadth of brand recall and to assess brand salience, we might need to examine the context of the purchase decision or consumption situation, such as different times and places. The stronger the brand associations to these non-product considerations, the more likely it is that consumers will recall them when given those situational cues.

When combined, measures of recall based on product attribute or category cues and situational or usage cues give an indication of breadth and depth of recall. We can further distinguish brand recall according to the order as well as the latency or speed of recall. In many cases, people will recognize a brand when it is shown to them and will recall it if they are given a sufficient number of cues. Thus, potential recallability is high. The more important issue is the salience of the brand: Do consumers think of the brand under the right circumstances, for example, when they could be either buying or using the product? How quickly do they think of the brand? Is it automatically or easily recalled? Is it the first brand they recall?

### Corrections for Guessing.

Any research measure must consider the issue of consumers making up responses or guessing. That problem may be especially evident with certain types of aided awareness or recognition measures for the brand. Spurious awareness occurs when consumers erroneously claim they recall something they really don’t and that may not even exist. For example, one market research firm, Oxtoby-Smith, conducted a benchmark study of awareness of health and beauty products.<sup>41</sup> In the study, the firm asked consumers questions like this:

> “The following is a list of denture adhesive brand names. Please answer yes if you’ve heard the name before and no if you haven’t. Okay? Orafix? Fasteeth? Dentu-Tight? Fixodent?”

Although 16 percent of the sample reported that they had heard of Dentu-Tight, there was one problem: it didn’t exist! Similarly high levels of reported recall were reported for plausible-sounding but fictitious brands such as Four O’Clock Tea (8 percent), Leone Pasta (16 percent), and Mrs. Smith’s Cake Mix (31 percent). On the basis of this study, Oxtoby-Smith found that spurious awareness was about 8 percent for new health and beauty products and even higher in some other product categories. In one case, a proposed line extension was mistakenly thought to already exist by about 50 percent of the sample (a finding that no doubt sent a message to the company that it should go ahead and introduce the product!).

From a marketing perspective, the problem with spurious awareness is that it may send misleading signals about the proper strategic direction for a brand. For example, Oxtoby-Smith reported that one of its clients was struggling with a 5 percent market share despite the fact that 50 percent of survey respondents reported they were aware of the brand. On the surface, it would seem a good idea to improve the image of the brand and attitudes toward it in some way. Upon further examination, marketers determined that spurious awareness accounted for *almost half* the survey respondents who reported brand awareness, suggesting that a more appropriate solution to the true problem would be to first build awareness to a greater degree. Marketers should be sensitive to the possibilities of misleading signals because of spurious brand awareness, especially with new brands or ones with plausible-sounding names.

### Strategic Implications.

The advantage of aided recall measures is that they yield insight into how brand knowledge is organized in memory and what kind of cues or reminders may be necessary for consumers to be able to retrieve the brand from memory. Understanding recall when We use different levels of product category specificity as cues is important, because it has implications for how consumers form consideration sets and make product decisions.
