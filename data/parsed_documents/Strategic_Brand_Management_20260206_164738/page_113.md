To create brand loyalty and resonance, marketers must ensure that consumers’ experiences with the product at least meet, if not actually surpass, their expectations.

**Brand performance** describes how well the product or service meets customers’ more functional needs. How well does the brand rate on objective assessments of quality?

## SUBWAY

Subway has zoomed to the top as the biggest-selling quick-serve restaurant through a clever positioning of offering healthy, good-tasting sandwiches. This straddle positioning allows the brand to create a POP on taste and a POD on health with respect to quick-serve restaurants such as McDonald’s and Burger King but, at the same time, a POP on health and a POD on taste with respect to health food restaurants and cafés. One of Subway’s highly successful product launches was the $5 footlong sandwich. Dreamed up by a franchise operator in Miami, the idea quickly took hold and was the perfect solution for hungry, cash-starved consumers during the recession. This strong performance and value message has allowed Subway to significantly expand its market coverage and potential customer base.⁵
