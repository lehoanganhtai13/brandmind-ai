## Online Strategies

The advantages of having both a physical “brick and mortar” channel and a virtual, online retail channel are becoming clearer to many firms. Integrated channels allow consumers to shop when and how they want. Many consumers value the convenience of ordering from companies online or over the phone and picking up the physical product at their local store rather than having it shipped. They also want to be able to return merchandise at a store even if they originally bought it and had it shipped outside the store.⁹⁰

Many consumers also like the convenience of being able to access their online account inside the store and use Internet kiosks to research purchase decisions in the store itself.⁹¹ The influence of the Internet extends outside the store too. In a Forrester research report, it was estimated that 16 percent of all store sales were influenced by consumers initially searching on the Web outside the store.⁹²

Integrating channels does not benefit only consumers. Figure 5-6 shows an analysis of JCPenney’s channel mix, which reveals that its most profitable customers were those who shopped multiple channels. Similarly, a Deloitte study revealed that multichannel shoppers spent 82 percent more in each transaction than those who shopped in only one store.⁹³

The Boston Consulting Group concluded that multichannel retailers were able to acquire customers at half the cost of Internet-only retailers, citing a number of advantages for the multichannel retailers:⁹⁴

* They have market clout with suppliers.
* They have established distribution and fulfillment systems (L.L. Bean and Land’s End).
* They can cross-sell between Web sites and stores (The Gap and Barnes & Noble).

Many of these same advantages are realized by multichannel product manufacturers. Recognizing the power of integrated channels, many Internet-based companies are also engaging in “physical world” activities to boost their brand. For example, Yahoo! opened a promotional store in New York’s Rockefeller Center, and eTrade.com opened a flagship own-brand financial center on New York’s Madison Avenue as well as mini-centers and kiosks in Target stores.

## Summary

Channels are the means by which firms distribute their products to consumers. Channel strategy to build brand equity includes designing and managing direct and indirect channels to build brand awareness and improve the brand image. Direct channels can enhance brand equity by allowing consumers to better understand the depth, breadth, and variety of the products associated with the brand as well as any distinguishing characteristics. Indirect channels can influence brand equity through the actions and support of intermediaries such as retailers, and the transfer of any associations that these intermediaries might have to the brand.

This figure presents a customer channel value analysis for JCPenney, illustrating the cumulative value generated by customers interacting through various combinations of channels: Internet, Retail, and Catalog. The analysis shows a clear progression in customer value as more channels are utilized. Customers engaging solely through the Internet contribute $157 in value. This value increases to $195 for Retail-only customers and $201 for Catalog-only customers. Combining channels significantly boosts value: Internet + Catalog customers generate $446, while Internet + Retail customers contribute $485. The highest value is observed with the integration of multiple channels, with Catalog + Retail customers reaching $608 and those utilizing all three channels – Catalog + Retail + Internet – achieving the maximum value of $887. This data highlights a hierarchical structure where multi-channel engagement leads to progressively higher customer value. Direct and indirect channels offer varying advantages and disadvantages that marketers must thoughtfully combine, both to sell products in the short run, and maintain and enhance brand equity in the long run.
