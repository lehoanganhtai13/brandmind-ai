# BRANDING BRIEF 12-1

## Growing the McDonald’s Brand

Market saturation, global health concerns, and a slumping economy have presented significant obstacles to its growth. To overcome these, the company has employed a number of different growth strategies that we can classify using the Ansoff growth share matrix. As a result of these strategies, the company’s financial fortunes have rebounded, and McDonald’s has outperformed many of its peers in revenue growth. The brand has even been credited with producing a “halo effect” that is “driving growth for the entire quick-service restaurant category.”

### Market Penetration

For a long time, McDonald’s increased its market penetration just by introducing hundreds of new outlets each year. But by 2002, markets had become saturated and sales had slumped. On becoming CEO in 2004, James Skinner adopted a new corporate motto, “Better, not bigger.” Rather than trying to grow by adding new restaurants, McDonald’s would grow by generating greater returns from the ones it had.

Thus, instead of investing in new real estate, the firm made huge investments in upgrading the facilities and operations of existing stores. One important way McDonald’s made it easier for its customers to spend more money was by expanding to 24-hour service at many stores. To better accommodate these longer hours, the menu has been constantly fine-tuned so there are offerings to suit any meal or snack opportunity.

Breakfast has become an essential part of the McDonald’s revenue equation. A quarter of its domestic revenue—over $6 billion—and half its profits come from breakfast, which includes the highly successful McMuffin and McGriddle breakfast sandwiches. Snack Wraps and smoothies entice customers between meals. Snack Wraps are ideal for drive-thru customers who need to have one hand on the steering wheel; 60 percent of sales are drive-thru generated.

McDonald’s decade-long “I’m Lovin’ It” global advertising campaign has served as the perfect vehicle to support new product launches and enhance loyalty. Translated into a number of languages worldwide, it replaced some 20 different ad platforms that had been running in different regions.

### Market Development

McDonald’s has made concerted efforts to expand globally through the years, and its progress has been astounding. There are over 33,000 restaurants worldwide in 119 different countries today, and 1.7 million employees serve 64 million customers.

Even in a product category as simple and established as hamburgers—U.S. consumers eat 13 billion burgers a year, 4.3 for every man, woman, and child—new brands can appear. *Forbes* magazine dubbed Denver-based Smashburger as one of the most promising U.S. companies on the basis of its “thoughtful product design and deft execution,” and the fact that it offered “more interesting fare and a (small) dash of ambience at a reasonable price premium.” And Shake Shack’s updated “roadside burger stand” now brings in almost a third of the profits of Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns three of the *Zagat Guide*’s top five dining establishments in Manhattan!<sup>6</sup> daily in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, Canada, and Latin America.
