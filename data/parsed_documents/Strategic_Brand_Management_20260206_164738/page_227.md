What makes an effective radio ad? Radio has been less studied than other media. Because of its low-involvement nature and limited sensory options, advertising on radio often must be fairly focused. For example, the advertising pioneer David Ogilvy believed four factors were critical:

1. **Identify your brand early in the commercial.**  
2. **Identify it often.**  
3. **Promise the listener a benefit early in the commercial.**  
4. **Repeat it often.**

Nevertheless, radio ads can be extremely creative. Some see the lack of visual images as a plus because they feel the clever use of music, sounds, humor, and other creative devices can tap into the listener’s imagination in a way that creates powerfully relevant and liked images.

**Print.** Print media has taken a huge hit in recent years as more and more consumers choose to collect information and seek entertainment online. In response, publishers are doing their own digital innovation in the form of iPad apps and a stronger Web presence.

Print media does offer a stark contrast to broadcast media. Most importantly, because they are self-paced, magazines and newspapers can provide detailed product information. At the same time, the static nature of the visual images in print media makes it difficult to provide dynamic presentations or demonstrations. Another disadvantage of print advertising is that it can be a fairly passive medium.

**Pros & Cons.** The two main print media—magazines and newspapers—have many of the same advantages and disadvantages. Magazines are particularly effective at building user and usage imagery. They can also be highly engaging: one study showed that consumers are more likely to view magazine ads as less intrusive, more truthful, and more relevant than ads in other media and are less likely to multitask while reading.
