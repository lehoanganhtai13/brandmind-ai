**Communication Strategy.** Advertising is one area of marketing communications in which many firms face challenges internationally. Although the brand positioning may be the same in different countries, creative strategies in advertising may have to differ to some degree. One highly successful recent global brand campaign promoted Johnnie Walker Scotch.

### JOHNNIE WALKER

The top Scotch brand of Diageo—the largest multinational wine and spirits company—has its roots in nineteenth-century Scotland. In 1908, the brand itself was launched, including the iconic logo of a cane-wielding man clad in boots and a top hat striding forward, in honor of the founder John, or “Johnnie,” Walker. Every type of Johnnie Walker Scotch has a label color to denote type and quality and signify usage occasion. More recently, at about the turn of the century, the brand experienced a downturn, and sales dropped almost 10 percent. A new ad agency determined that the brand needed to better establish its “World Cup–level” icon status. The insight to achieve that goal was that a new generation of men shared a common desire to move forward and improve themselves in some way. Renowned ad agency BBH reversed the logo image so the “Striding Man” would be moving from left to right, to signify personal progress. With a slogan, “Keep Walking,” a campaign was launched in 120 countries via 30 TV ads, 150 print ads, radio ads, Web sites, sponsorships, internal awards, and a cause program to support the brand’s purpose. A five-minute film, *The Man Who Walked Around the World*, featured actor Robert Carlyle cleverly outlining Johnnie Walker’s brand history in one continuous, flowing shot. The global brand concept was creatively applied in different markets to make it locally recognizable and relevant. In Africa, a key target for brand growth, Johnnie Walker is put forth as a symbol of personal success. Billboards and magazine ads there feature champion Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie “running for gold.”[^36]

Different countries can be more or less receptive to different creative styles. For example, humor is more common in U.S. and UK ads than, say, in German ads. European countries such as France and Italy are more tolerant of sex appeal and nudity in advertising.[^37] The penetration of satellite and cable TV has expanded broadcast media options, making it easier to simultaneously air the same TV commercial in many different countries. U.S. cable networks such as CNN, MTV, and the Cartoon Network, and other networks such as Sky TV in Commonwealth countries and Star TV in Asia have increased advertisers’ global reach.

In terms of print, *Fortune*, *Time*, *Newsweek*, and other magazines have printed foreign editions in English for years. Other publishers have also added local-language editions by licensing BONO, JESSICA ALBA, LARRY WACHOWSKI, Rolling Stone, U2.
