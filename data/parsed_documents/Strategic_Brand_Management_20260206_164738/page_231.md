First major city to allow its taxi cabs to advertise via onboard television screens. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of taxi advertisers doubled, and included brands such as AOL, Citibank, and Sprint. Research has shown that passengers keep the TVs on 85 percent of the time.³⁰

Advertisers can now buy space in stadiums and arenas and on garbage cans, bicycle racks, parking meters, airport luggage carousels, elevators, gasoline pumps, the bottom of golf cups, airline snacks, and supermarket produce in the form of tiny labels on apples and bananas. Leaving no stone unturned, advertisers can even buy space in toilet stalls and above urinals, which, according to research studies, office workers visit an average of three to four times a day for roughly four minutes per visit. At Chicago O’Hare airport, digital commercials are now being shown in 150 bathroom mirrors above lavatory sinks.³¹ Figure 6-4 displays some of the most successful outdoor advertisers.

**Movies, Airlines, Lounges, and Other Places.** Increasingly, advertisers are placing traditional TV and print ads in unconventional places. Companies such as Whittle Communication and Turner Broadcasting have tried placing TV and commercial programming in classrooms, airport lounges, and other public places. Airlines now offer media-sponsored audio and video programming that accepts advertising (*USA Today Sky Radio* and *National Geographic Explorer*) and include catalogs in seat pockets for leading mail-order companies (*SkyMall* magazine). Movie theater chains such as Loews Cineplex now run 30-, 60-, or 90-second ads on 2,000-plus screens. Although the same ads that appear on TV or in magazines often appear in these unconventional places, many advertisers believe it is important to create specially designed ads for these out-of-home exposures to better meet consumer expectations.

Figure 6-4 presents a chronological list of Obie Hall of Fame winners, as selected by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. This data highlights a series of companies recognized for their achievements in outdoor advertising, spanning from 2006 to 2011. The winners include Chick-fil-A in 2006, followed by the Walt Disney Company in 2007. The list continues with Altoids in 2008, Absolut in 2009, and MINI Cooper in 2010. The most recent inductee shown is Cracker Barrel Old Country Store in 2011. This structure illustrates a year-by-year progression of distinguished outdoor advertising campaigns and their corporate recipients. **Product Placement.** Many major marketers pay fees of $50,000–100,000 and even higher so their products can make cameo appearances in movies and on television, with the exact fee depending on the amount and nature of the brand exposure.
