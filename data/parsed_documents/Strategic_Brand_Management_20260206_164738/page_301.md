# DESIGNING BRAND TRACKING STUDIES

Brand audits are a means to provide in-depth information and insights essential for setting long-term strategic direction for the brand. But to gather information for short-term tactical decisions, marketers will typically collect less detailed brand-related information through ongoing tracking studies.

**Brand tracking studies** collect information from consumers on a routine basis over time, usually through quantitative measures of brand performance on a number of key dimensions that marketers can identify in the brand audit or other means. They apply components from the brand value chain to better understand where, how much, and in what ways brand value is being created, offering invaluable information about how well the brand has achieved its positioning.

As more marketing activity surrounds the brand—as the firm introduces brand extensions or incorporates an increasing variety of communication options in support of the brand—it becomes difficult and expensive to research each one. Regardless of how few or how many changes are made in the marketing program over time, however, marketers need to monitor the health of the brand and its equity so they can make adjustments if necessary.

Tracking studies thus play an important role by providing consistent baseline information to facilitate day-to-day decision making. A good tracking system can help marketers better understand a host of important considerations such as category dynamics, consumer behavior, competitive vulnerabilities and opportunities, and marketing effectiveness and efficiency.

## What to Track

Chapter 3 provided a detailed list of potential measures that correspond to the brand resonance model, all of which are candidates for tracking. It is usually necessary to customize tracking surveys, however, to address the specific issues faced by the brand or brands in question. Each brand faces a unique situation that the different types of questions in its tracking survey should reflect.

### Product–Brand Tracking.

Tracking an individual branded product requires measuring brand awareness and image, using both recall and recognition measures and moving from more general to more specific questions. Thus, it may make sense to first ask consumers what brands come to mind in certain situations, to next ask for recall of brands on the basis of various product category cues, and to then finish with tests of brand recognition (if necessary).

Moving from general to more specific measures is also a good idea in brand tracking surveys to measure brand image, especially specific perceptions like what consumers think characterizes the brand, and evaluations such as what the brand means to consumers. A number of specific brand associations typically exist for the brand, depending on the richness of consumer knowledge structures, which marketers can track over time.

Given that brands often compete at the augmented product level (see Chapter 1), it is important to measure all associations that may distinguish competing brands. Thus, measures of specific, “lower-level” brand associations should include all potential sources of brand equity such as performance and imagery attributes and functional and emotional benefits. Benefit associations often represent key points-of-parity or points-of-difference, so it is particularly important to track them as well. To better understand any changes in benefit beliefs for a brand, however, marketers may also want to measure the attribute beliefs that underlie those benefit beliefs. In other words, changes in descriptive attribute beliefs may help to explain changes in more evaluative benefit beliefs for a brand.

Marketers should assess those key brand associations that make up the potential sources of brand equity on the basis of strength, favorability, and uniqueness *in that order*. Unless associations are strong enough for consumers to recall them, their favorability does not matter, and unless they are favorable enough to influence consumers’ decisions, their uniqueness does not matter. Ideally, marketers will collect measures of all three dimensions, but perhaps for only certain associations and only some of the time; for example, favorability and uniqueness may be measured only once a year for three to five key associations.

At the same time, marketers will track more general, “higher-level” judgments, feelings, and other outcome-related measures. After soliciting their overall opinions, consumers can be asked whether they have changed their attitudes or behavior in recent weeks or months and, if so, why. Branding Brief 8-1 provides an illustrative example of a simple tracking survey for McDonald’s.

### Corporate or Family Brand Tracking.

Marketers may also want to track the corporate or family brand separately or concurrently (or both) with individual products. Besides the measures Assume McDonald’s is interested in designing a short online tracking survey.
