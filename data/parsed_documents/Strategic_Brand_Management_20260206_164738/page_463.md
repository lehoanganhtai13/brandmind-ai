shape, color, size, and usage. They may see a basis of fit between tennis racquets and tennis shoes rather than between tennis racquets and golf clubs, despite the fact that the latter actually share more manufacturing commonalities. The effects for more knowledgeable consumers were reversed, because they recognized the technical synergies in manufacturing tennis racquets and golf clubs.

Zhang and Sood showed a similar pattern of knowledge effects based on age. Children—who have less brand knowledge than adults—were more likely to evaluate extensions on the basis of surface cues (such as brand name linguistic characteristics of an extension, for example whether a brand name rhymed or not) while adults were more likely to use deep cues (like category similarity between the parent brand and extension category).

4. **High-quality brands stretch farther than average-quality brands, although both types have boundaries.** Consumers often see high-quality brands as more credible, expert, and trustworthy. As a result, even if they believe a relatively distant extension does not really fit with the brand, they may be more willing to give a high-quality brand the benefit of the doubt than a brand they see as average in quality.

Thus, one important benefit of building a strong brand is that it can extend more easily into more diverse categories. Fedorikhin, Park, and Thomson found that if consumers had a high degree of attachment with a brand, they were willing to pay more for an extension, recommend it to others, and forgive any mishaps. Similarly, Yeung and Wyer showed that if a brand evokes a strong positive emotional reaction, consumers are likely to be less influenced by the fit of the extension.

Regardless, all brands have boundaries, as a number of observers have persuasively argued by pointing out ridiculous, and even comical, hypothetical brand extension possibilities. As Tauber once noted, few consumers would want Jell-O shoelaces or Tide frozen entrees!

5. **A brand that consumers see as prototypical for a product category can be difficult to extend outside the category.** As a caveat to the conclusion above, if consumers see a brand as exemplifying a category too strongly, it may be difficult for them to think of it in any other way. Numerous examples exist of category leaders that have failed in introducing brand extensions.

Bayer, a brand synonymous with aspirin, ran into a stumbling block introducing the Bayer Select line of specialized nonaspirin painkillers. Chiquita was unsuccessful in its attempt to move beyond its strong “banana” association with a frozen juice bar extension. Country Time could not overcome its “lemonade” association to introduce an apple cider.
