This table outlines six dimensions of brand engagement, each framed by a key question and a description of the corresponding value. The dimensions are: Conversation, focusing on user recognition and buzz generation; Advocacy, measuring how many users actively promote the brand; Information, assessing the perceived value of information exchange among customers; Affiliation, exploring the sense of community created by the brand; Utility, evaluating the value consumers derive from social interaction related to the brand; and Identity, examining how users identify with others through brand usage. Collectively, these dimensions describe a spectrum of customer interaction and connection with a brand, ranging from passive recognition and information exchange to active advocacy and the formation of community and identity.

### Active Engagement.

According to the brand resonance model, *active engagement* for a brand is defined as the extent to which consumers are willing to invest their own personal resources—time, energy, money, and so on—on the brand beyond those resources expended during purchase or consumption of the brand.

For example, in terms of engagement, in-depth measures could explore word-of-mouth behavior, online behavior, and so forth. For online behavior, measures could explore the extent of customer-initiated versus firm-initiated interactions, the extent of learning and teaching by the customer versus by the firm, the extent of customers teaching other customers, and so on.<sup>53</sup>

The key to such metrics is the qualitative nature of the consumer-brand interaction and how well it reflects intensity of feelings. One mistake many Internet firms made was to put too much emphasis on “eyeballs” and “stickiness”—the number and duration of page views at a Web site, respectively. The depth of the underlying brand relationships of the customers making those visits, however, and the manner in which those relationships manifest themselves in brand-beneficial actions, will typically be more important.

Accordingly, researchers are attempting to determine the brand value of different online and social media activities.<sup>54</sup> For example, how important is a “like” from a user on Facebook? One firm estimated that bringing a user on as a fan could be worth between 44 cents and $3.60 in equivalent media value from increased impressions generated from the Facebook newsfeed. Critics of the study, however, pointed out that not all fans are created equal.<sup>55</sup>

Several different specific approaches have been suggested to measure brand engagement. *The Science of Branding* 9-2 provides a detailed breakdown of the concept.

### Fournier’s Brand Relationship Research.

Boston University’s Susan Fournier argues that brands can and do serve as viable relationship partners, and she suggests a reconceptualization of the notion of brand personality within this framework.<sup>56</sup> Specifically, the everyday execution of marketing mix decisions constitutes a set of behaviors enacted on the part of the brand. These actions trigger a series of inferences regarding the implicit *contract* that appears to guide the engagement of the consumer and brand and, hence, the type of relationship formed.

Brand personality as conceptualized within this framework describes the *relationship role* enacted by the brand in its partnership capacity. For example, if the brand expresses behaviors that signal commitment to the consumer, and further if it sends gifts as symbols of affection, the consumer may infer a courtship or marriage type of engagement with the brand.

Fournier identifies a typology of 15 different relationship types characterizing consumers’ engagement with brands (see Figure 9-11). Fournier argues that this relationship role view of brand personality provides more actionable guidance to managers who wish to create and manage their brand personalities in line with marketing actions than does the trait-based There are several different ways to think of brand engagement.
