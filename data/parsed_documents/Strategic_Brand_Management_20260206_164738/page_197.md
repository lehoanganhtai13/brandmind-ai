product reformulations, and process changes like automation or other factory improvements.53  
As one marketing executive once put it:

> The customer is only going to pay you for what he perceives as real value-added. When you look at your overhead, you’ve got to ask yourself if the customer is really willing to pay for that. If the answer is no, you’ve got to figure out how to get rid of it or you’re not going to make money.54

To reduce its costs to achieve value pricing, Procter & Gamble cut overhead according to four simple guidelines: change the work, do more with less, eliminate work, and reduce costs that cannot be passed on to consumers. P&G simplified the distribution chain to make restocking more efficient through continuous product replenishment. The company also scaled back its product portfolio by eliminating 25 percent of its stock-keeping units.

Firms have to be able to develop business models and cost structures to support their pricing plans. Taco Bell reduced operating costs enough to lower prices for many items on the menu to under $1, sparking an industry-wide trend in fast foods. Unfortunately, many other fast food chains found it difficult to lower their overhead costs enough or found that their value menu cannibalized more profitable items.55

Cost reductions certainly cannot sacrifice quality, effectiveness, or efficiency. Toyota and Johnson & Johnson’s Tylenol both experienced brand crises due to product problems, which analysts and even some of the management of the two firms attributed to overly zealous cost reductions. When H&R Block cut costs as it moved into new areas outside tax preparation, customer service suffered and customers began to complain about long wait times and rudeness.56

**Product Prices.** The final key to a successful value-pricing strategy is to understand exactly how much value consumers perceive in the brand and thus to what extent they will pay a premium over product costs.57 A number of techniques are available to estimate these consumer value perceptions. Perhaps the most straightforward approach is to directly ask consumers their perceptions of price and value in different ways.

The price suggested by estimating perceived value can often be a starting point for marketers in determining actual marketplace prices, adjusting by cost and competitive considerations as necessary. For example, to halt a precipitous slide in market share for its flagship 9-Lives brand, the pet products division of H. J. Heinz took a new tack in its pricing strategy. The company found from research that consumers wanted to be able to buy cat food at the price of “four cans for a dollar,” despite the fact that its cat food cost between 29 and 35 cents per can. As a result, Heinz reshaped its product packaging and redesigned its manufacturing processes to be able to hit the necessary cost, price, and margin targets. Despite lower prices, profits for the brand doubled.
