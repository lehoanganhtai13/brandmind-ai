But just as a thermometer measuring body temperature provides only one indication of how healthy a person is, so does any one measure of brand equity provide only one indication of the health of a brand. Brand equity is a multidimensional concept, and complex enough to require many different types of measures. Applying multiple measures increases the diagnostic power of marketing research and the likelihood that managers will better understand what is happening to their brands and, perhaps more important, why.¹

In arguments suggesting that researchers should employ multiple measures of brand equity, writers have drawn interesting comparisons between measuring brand equity and assessing the performance of an aircraft in flight or a car on the road; for example:

> The pilot of the plane has to consider a number of indicators and gauges as the plane is flown. There is the fuel gauge, the altimeter, and a number of other important status indicators. All of these dials and meters tell the pilot different things about the health of the plane. There is no one gauge that summarizes everything about the plane. The plane needs the altimeter, compass, radar, and the fuel gauge. As the pilot looks at the instrument cluster, he has to take all of these critical indicators into account as he flies.²

The dashboard of a car or the gauges on the plane, which together measure its “health” while being driven or flown, are analogous to the multiple measures of brand equity necessary to assess the health of a brand.

The preceding chapter described different approaches to measuring brand knowledge structures and the customer mind-set that marketers can use to identify and quantify potential sources of brand equity. By applying these measurement techniques, we should gain a good understanding of the depth and breadth of brand awareness; the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations; the positivity of brand responses; and the nature of brand relationships for their brands. As we described in Chapters 1 and 2, a product with positive brand equity can enjoy the following six important customer-related benefits:

1. **Perception of better product or service performance**  
2. **Greater loyalty and less vulnerability to competitive marketing actions and marketing crises**  
3. **Larger margins and more inelastic responses to price increases and elastic responses to price decreases**  
4. **Greater trade cooperation and support**  
5. **Increased marketing communication effectiveness**  
6. **Opportunity for successful licensing and brand extension**

The customer-based brand equity model maintains that these benefits, and thus the ultimate value of a brand, depend on the underlying components of brand knowledge and sources of brand equity. As Chapter 9 described, we can measure these individual components; however, to provide more direct estimates, we still must assess their resulting value in some way. This chapter examines measurement procedures to assess the effects of brand knowledge structures on these and other measures that capture market performance for the brand.³

First, we review comparative methods, which are means to better assess the effects of consumer perceptions and preferences on consumer response to the marketing program and the specific benefits of brand equity. Next, we look at holistic methods, which attempt to estimate the overall or summary value of a brand.⁴ Some of the interplay between branding and financial considerations is included in Brand Focus 10.0.
