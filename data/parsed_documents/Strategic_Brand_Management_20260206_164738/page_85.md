In other cases, PODs come from imagery associations (the luxury and status imagery of Louis Vuitton or the fact that British Airways is advertised as the “world’s favourite airline”). Many top brands attempt to create a point-of-difference on “overall superior quality,” whereas other firms become the “low-cost provider” of a product or service.

Thus, a host of different types of PODs are possible. PODs are generally defined in terms of consumer benefits. These benefits often have important underlying “proof points” or *reasons to believe* (RTBs). These proof points can come in many forms: functional design concerns (a unique shaving system technology, leading to the benefit of a “closer electric shave”); key attributes (a unique tread design, leading to the benefit of “safer tires”); key ingredients (contains fluoride, leading to the benefit of “prevents dental cavities”); or key endorsements (recommended by more audio engineers, leading to the benefit of “superior music fidelity”).<sup>42</sup> Having compelling proof points and RTBs are often critical to the deliverability aspect of a POD.

### Points-of-Parity Associations.  
*Points-of-parity associations* (POPs), on the other hand, are not necessarily unique to the brand but may in fact be shared with other brands. There are three types: category, competitive, and correlational.

*Category points-of-parity* represent necessary—but not necessarily sufficient—conditions for brand choice. They exist minimally at the generic product level and are most likely at the expected product level. Thus, consumers might not consider a bank truly a “bank” unless it offered a range of checking and savings plans; provided safety deposit boxes, traveler’s checks, and other such services; and had convenient hours and automated teller machines. Category POPs may change over time because of technological advances, legal developments, and consumer trends, but these attributes and benefits are like “greens fees” to play the marketing game.

*Competitive points-of-parity* are those associations designed to negate competitors’ points-of-difference. In other words, if a brand can “break even” in those areas where its competitors are trying to find an advantage and can achieve its own advantages in some other areas, the brand should be in a strong—and perhaps unbeatable—competitive position.

*Correlational points-of-parity* are those potentially negative associations that arise from the existence of other, more positive associations for the brand. One challenge for marketers is that many of the attributes or benefits that make up their POPs or PODs are inversely related. In other words, in the minds of consumers, if your brand is good at one thing, it can’t be seen as also good on something else. For example, consumers might find it hard to believe a brand is “inexpensive” and at the same time “of the highest quality.” Figure 2-6 displays some other examples of negatively correlated attributes and benefits.

Moreover, individual attributes and benefits often have both positive and negative aspects. A long heritage could be seen as a positive attribute because it can suggest experience, wisdom, and expertise. On the other hand, it could be a negative attribute because it might imply being old-fashioned and not contemporary and up-to-date. Below, we consider strategies to address these trade-offs.

### Points-of-Parity versus Points-of-Difference.  
POPs are important because they can undermine PODs: unless certain POPs can be achieved to overcome potential weaknesses, PODs may not even matter. For the brand to achieve a point-of-parity on a particular attribute or benefit, a sufficient number of consumers must believe that the brand is “good enough” on that dimension.

There is a “zone” or “range of tolerance or acceptance” with POPs. The brand does not have to be seen as *literally* equal to competitors, but consumers must feel that it does sufficiently well on that particular attribute or benefit so that they do not consider it to be a negative or a problem. Assuming consumers feel that way, they may then be willing to base their evaluations and decisions on other factors potentially more favorable to the brand.

Figure 2-6 illustrates examples of negatively correlated attributes and their associated benefits, presenting a comparative structure where one desirable characteristic is often inversely related to another. This inverse relationship is demonstrated across various domains, including product features and personal attributes. For instance, a low price is typically contrasted with high quality, while desirable taste is often at odds with low calories. Similarly, nutritious food may not be as good tasting, and efficacious treatments might be less mild. Further examples highlight that powerful products can be less safe, strong attributes may lack refinement, ubiquitous availability contrasts with exclusivity, and varied options are often opposed by simplicity. This figure effectively maps out common trade-offs encountered when evaluating different options or characteristics. Points-of-parity are thus easier to achieve than points-of-difference, where the brand must demonstrate clear superiority.
