This table presents a comparative analysis of food items based on two primary dimensions: healthiness and flavor. The overarching structure is a 2x2 matrix, though only one quadrant is explicitly populated with data. The dimension of "Flavorful" is presented at the top, with a sub-categorization of "Less Healthy" and "Healthy" along the vertical axis. Within the "Flavorful" category, the "Less Healthy" row contains data points represented by "2", "C", "A", and "B 1". The "Healthy" category within "Flavorful" is left blank. A separate category, "Less Flavorful," is presented below the main matrix, indicating a contrasting set of food items that are not flavorful. This suggests a trade-off or spectrum where food can be categorized by its level of flavor and its health implications.

Hypothetical Restaurant Perceptual Map

Be predictive of actual purchase when there is correspondence between the two in the following dimensions:  
* Action (buying for own use or to give as a gift)  
* Target (specific type of product and brand)  
* Context (in what type of store based on what prices and other conditions)  
* Time (within a week, month, or year)  

In other words, when asking consumers to forecast their likely purchase of a product or a brand, we want to specify *exactly* the circumstances—the purpose of the purchase, the location of the purchase, the time of the purchase, and so forth. For example, we could ask consumers:

> “Assume your refrigerator broke down over the next weekend and could not be inexpensively repaired. If you went to your favorite appliance store and found all the different brands competitively priced, how likely would you be to buy a General Electric refrigerator?”  

Consumers could indicate their purchase intention on an 11-point probability scale that ranges from 0 (definitely would not buy) to 10 (definitely would buy).

### Likelihood to Recommend

Bain’s Frederick Reichheld suggests there is only one customer question that really matters: “How likely is it that you would recommend this product or service to a friend or colleague?” According to Reichheld, a customer’s willingness to recommend results from all aspects of a customer’s experience.

Reichheld uses answers to this question to create what he calls a Net Promoter Score (NPS). Specifically, in a survey, customers are asked to rate their likelihood to recommend on a 0–10-point scale. Marketers then subtract *detractors* (those who gave a 0–6) from *promoters* (those who gave a 9 or 10) to arrive at the NPS score. Customers who rate the brand with a 7 or 8 are deemed *passively satisfied* and are not included. A typical set of NPS scores falls in the 10–30 percent range, but world-class companies can score over 50 percent. Some firms with top NPS scores include USAA (89 percent), Apple (77 percent), Amazon.com (74 percent), and Google (71 percent).

Several companies have seen benefits from adopting Net Promoter scores as a means of tracking brand health. When the European unit of GE Healthcare overhauled its call center and put more specialists in the field, GE Healthcare’s Net Promoter scores jumped 10–15 points. BearingPoint found clients who gave it high Net Promoter scores showed the highest revenue growth. When Intuit applied Net Promoter to its TurboTax product, feedback revealed dissatisfaction with the software’s rebate procedure. After Intuit dropped the proof-of-purchase requirement, sales jumped 6 percent.
