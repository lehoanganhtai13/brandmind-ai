# BRANDING BRIEF 11-4

## Corporate Innovation at 3M

In 1904, the company’s directors were faced with a failed mining operation, but they turned the leftover grit and waste into a revolutionary new product: sandpaper. Today, 3M makes more than 50,000 products, including adhesives, contact lenses, and optical films. Over the last century, some of its noteworthy product launches include Scotch masking and transparent tape, Scotchgard fabric protector, and Post-it Notes.

Each year, 3M launches scores of new products, and the company generates significant revenues from those introduced within the past five years. It regularly ranks among the top 10 U.S. companies each year in patents received. 3M budgets roughly 5–6 percent of sales to R&D, totaling $1–$1.5 billion annually. The firm is able to consistently produce innovations in part because it promotes a corporate environment that facilitates new discoveries:

* 3M encourages everyone, not just engineers, to become “product champions.” The company’s “15 percent time” lets all employees spend up to 15 percent of their time working on projects of personal interest. A culture of healthy competition among highly motivated peers helps 3M innovate and create.
* Each promising new idea is assigned to a multidisciplinary venture team headed by an “executive champion.” 3M hands Golden Step awards each year to the venture teams whose new products earned more than $2 million in U.S. sales or $4 million in worldwide sales within three years of commercial introduction.
* 3M expects some failures and uses them as opportunities to learn how to make products that work. It is also very selective about acquisitions, seeing them as only supplementary to organic growth and internal innovations and developments.
* Starting in 2010, 3M has introduced social networks into its innovation process, inviting 75,000 global employees and over 1,200 other people to participate in its annual Markets of the Future brainstorming session. Over 700 new ideas have been generated, leading to nine new markets for the company to explore.

Some of the innovations that emerged from 3M in 2010 include Cubitron II industrial abrasives, which are revolutionizing how grinding and abrading are done; new low-cost, maintenance-free respirators; and a new line of microprojectors for cars, classrooms, and recreational use.

heard and that the company has their best interests in mind. Often this philosophy is reflected throughout the marketing program and communicated through advertising.

### Values and Programs.

Corporate image associations may reflect company values and programs that do not always directly relate to the products. Firms can run corporate-image ad campaigns to describe to consumers, employees, and others their philosophy and actions with respect to organizational, social, political, or economic issues.

</page_header> For example, many recent corporate advertising campaigns have focused on environmental issues and social responsibility.
