Creativity must not sacrifice a brand-building goal, however, and marketers must orchestrate programs to provide seamlessly integrated solutions and personalized experiences for customers that create awareness, spur demand, and cultivate loyalty.

### Personalizing Marketing

The rapid expansion of the Internet and continued fragmentation of mass media have brought the need for personalized marketing into sharp focus. Many maintain that the modern economy celebrates the power of the individual consumer. To adapt to the increased consumer desire for personalization, marketers have embraced concepts such as experiential marketing and relationship marketing.

#### Experiential Marketing.

*Experiential marketing* promotes a product by not only communicating a product’s features and benefits but also connecting it with unique and interesting consumer experiences. One marketing commentator describes experiential marketing this way:

> “The idea is not to sell something, but to demonstrate how a brand can enrich a customer’s life.”[^7]

Pine and Gilmore, pioneers on the topic, argued over a decade ago that we are on the threshold of the “Experience Economy,” a new economic era in which all businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers.[^8] They made the following assertions:

* If you charge for stuff, then you are in the *commodity business*.
* If you charge for tangible things, then you are in the *goods business*.
* If you charge for the activities you perform, then you are in the *service business*.
* If you charge for the time customers spend with you, then and only then are you in the *experience business*.

Citing a range of examples from Disney to AOL, they maintain that saleable experiences come in four varieties: entertainment, education, aesthetic, and escapist.

Columbia University’s Bernd Schmitt, another pioneering expert on the subject, notes that “experiential marketing is usually broadly defined as any form of customer-focused marketing activity, at various touchpoints, that creates a sensory-emotional connection to customers.”⁹
