# BRANDING BRIEF 12-2

## Are There Any Boundaries to the Virgin Brand Name?

Perhaps the most extensive brand extension program in recent years has been undertaken by Richard Branson with his Virgin brand. Virgin’s brand strategy is to go into categories where consumer needs are not well met and do different things—and do them differently—to better satisfy consumers.

Branson founded the Virgin record label at the age of 21, and in 1984 he launched Virgin Atlantic Airways. Later, he made millions on the sale of his record label, his Virgin record retail chain, and his Virgin computer games business. After licensing the use of the Virgin name to European startup airlines that were flying the London–Athens and London–Dublin routes, Branson decided to expand the range of products carrying the Virgin brand.

Branson has since licensed the Virgin name for use on personal computers and set up joint ventures in 1994 to market Virgin Vodka and Virgin Cola. In 1997, he took over six of the United Kingdom’s government rail lines and established Virgin Rail. In 1999, he launched Virgin Mobile, a wireless company that provides cellular service through a partnership with Deutsche Telecom. He branched into e-commerce that same year with the debut of Virgin.com, a portal where consumers can purchase every product or service offered by the Virgin brand.

Today, the Virgin Group employs over 50,000 people, spans 30 countries, and contains more than 300 branded companies marketing such diverse product areas as travel, lifestyle, media and mobile, money, people and planet, music, health care, and alcohol (see below). Virgin had 2011 revenues of an estimated $21 billion, and Branson’s personal fortune was estimated at $4.2 billion in 2011.

Virgin’s growth and expansion has sparked debate about Branson’s seemingly undisciplined extension of the brand. One branding expert criticized Virgin’s rapid expansion: “Virgin makes no sense; it’s completely unfocused.” When Virgin ventures are poorly received, as Virgin Cola, Virgin Vodka, Virgin PCs, Virgin Jeans, Virgin Brides, and Virgin Clothing were in recent years, experts worry about the cumulative negative effect of these unsuccessful brands on the company’s overall equity. One marketing executive illustrated the risk of launching an unsuccessful brand by saying, “When I’m delayed on a Virgin train, I start wondering about Virgin Atlantic. Every experience of a brand counts, and negative experiences count even more.”

Some critics believe Virgin consumer products will do little more than generate publicity for Virgin airlines. They also warn of overexposure, even with the young, hip audience the Virgin brand has attracted. For example, one advertising agency executive remarked, “I would imagine the risk is that the Virgin brand name can come to mean everything to everybody, which in turn means it becomes nothing to nobody.” In Branson’s view, as long as a new brand adds value for the consumer, then it strengthens the Virgin image: “If the consumer benefits, I see no reason why we should be frightened about launching new products.”
