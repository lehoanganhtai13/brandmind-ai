According to Barwise and Robertson, there are trade-offs among the three criteria such that no strategy dominates. For example, the major problem with geographic extensions is speed. Because most firms don’t have the necessary financial resources and marketing experience to roll out products to a large number of countries simultaneously, global expansion can be a slow, market-by-market process. Brand acquisitions, on the other hand, can be expensive and often more difficult to control than typically assumed. Brand alliances may offer even less control, although they are generally much less costly.

The choice of entry strategy depends in part on how the resources and objectives of the firm match up with each strategy’s costs and benefits. Procter & Gamble would enter new markets in categories in which it excels (diapers, detergents, and sanitary pads), building its infrastructure and then bringing in other categories such as personal care or health care. Heineken’s sequential strategy was slightly different. The company first entered a new market by exporting to build brand awareness and image. If the market response was deemed satisfactory, the company licensed its brands to a local brewer in hopes of expanding volume. If that relationship were successful, Heineken might then take an equity stake or forge a joint venture, piggybacking sales of its high-priced brand with an established local brand.<sup>61</sup> As a result, Heineken is the world’s third-largest brewer in volume, selling in more than 170 countries with a product portfolio of over 250 brands. With brewing operations in about 70 countries and export activities all over the world, Heineken is the most international brewery group in the world.<sup>62</sup>

Companies are sometimes legally required to partner with a local company, as in many Middle Eastern countries, or when entering certain markets, such as insurance and telecoms in India. In other cases, companies elect to establish a joint venture with a corporate partner as a fast and convenient way to enter complex foreign markets. Fuji Xerox, initially formed to give Xerox a foothold in Japan, has been a highly successful joint venture that dominated the Japanese office equipment market for years and has even outperformed Xerox’s U.S. parent company. Joint ventures have been popular in Japan, where convoluted distribution systems, tightly knit supplier relationships, and close business–government cooperation have long encouraged foreign companies to link up with knowledgeable local partners.<sup>63</sup>

Finally, some mergers or acquisitions result from a desire to command a higher global profile. U.S. baby food maker Gerber agreed to be acquired by Swiss drug maker Sandoz in part because it needed to establish a stronger presence in Europe and Asia, where Sandoz has a solid base. Sandoz later merged with Ciba-Geigy and now is part of the Novartis group of companies.<sup>64</sup>

As these examples illustrate, different entry strategies have been adopted by different firms, by the same firm in different countries, or even in combination by one firm in the same country. Entry strategies can also evolve over time. Through its licensee Coca-Cola Amatil, Coca-Cola not only sells its global brands such as Coke, Fanta, and Sprite in Australia; it also sells local brands it has acquired such as Lift, Deep Spring, and Mount Franklin. One of Coca-Cola’s objectives with these acquisitions is to slowly migrate demand from some of the local brands to global brands, thus capitalizing on economies of scale. Branding Brief 14-4 describes how global brand powerhouse Nestlé has entered new markets.

## 6. Balance Standardization and Customization

As we discussed in detail above, one implication of similarities and differences across international markets is that marketers need to blend local and global elements in their marketing programs. The challenge, of course, is to get the right balance—to know which elements to customize or adapt and which to standardize.

Some of the factors often suggested in favor of a more standardized global marketing program include the following:

* Common customer needs  
* Global customers and channels  
* Favorable trade policies and common regulations  
* Compatible technical standards  
* Transferable marketing skills For about 15 years starting in 1984, Nestlé spent more than $30 billion on acquisitions in different countries, including such major brands as Carnation dairy (and other) products (United States), Perrier (France) and San Pellegrino (Italy) mineral water, Stouffer’s frozen foods (United States), Rowntree confectionery (United Kingdom), Ralston Purina pet food (United States), and Buitoni-Perugina pasta and chocolate (Italy).
