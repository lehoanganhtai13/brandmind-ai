# COMPARATIVE METHODS

There are two types of comparative methods.

* **Brand-based comparative approaches** use experiments in which one group of consumers responds to an element of the marketing program or some marketing activity when it is attributed to the target brand, and another group responds to that same element or activity when it is attributed to a competitive or fictitiously named brand.
* **Marketing-based comparative approaches** use experiments in which consumers respond to changes in elements of the marketing program or marketing activity for the target brand or competitive brands.

The brand-based approach holds the marketing program fixed and examines consumer response based on changes in brand identification, whereas the marketing-based approach holds the brand fixed and examines consumer response based on changes in the marketing program. We’ll look at each of these two approaches in turn and then describe conjoint analysis as a technique that, in effect, combines the two.

## Brand-Based Comparative Approaches

Competitive brands can be useful benchmarks in brand-based comparative approaches. Although consumers may interpret marketing activity for a fictitiously named or unnamed version of the product or service in terms of their general product category knowledge, they may also have a particular brand, or *exemplar*, in mind. This exemplar may be the category leader or some other brand that consumers feel is representative of the category, like their most preferred brand. Consumers may make inferences to supply any missing information based on their knowledge of this particular brand. Thus, it may be instructive to examine how consumers evaluate a proposed new ad campaign, new promotion offering, or new product when it is also attributed to one or more major competitors.

**Applications.** The classic example of the brand-based comparative approach is “blind testing” research studies in which different consumers examine or use a product with or without brand identification. Invariably, differences emerge. For example, in one study, people who were asked to blind test Coca-Cola and two store brands of cola split their preferences almost evenly among the three—31 percent for Coke and 33 percent and 35 percent for the others. But when the samples were identified, 50 percent of other participants in the experiment said they preferred Coke.<sup>5</sup>

One natural application of the brand-based comparative approach is product purchase or consumption research for new or existing products, as long as the brand identification can be hidden in some way for the “unbranded” control group. Brand-based comparative approaches are also useful to determine brand equity benefits related to price margins and premiums.

### T-MOBILE

Deutsche Telecom invested much time and money in recent years in building its T-Mobile mobile communication brand. In the United Kingdom, however, the company has leased or shared its network lines with competitor Virgin Mobile. As a result, the audio quality of the signal that a T-Mobile customer received in making a call should have been virtually identical to the audio quality of the signal for a Virgin Mobile customer. After all, the same network was being used to send the signal. Despite that fact, research showed that Virgin Mobile customers rated their signal quality significantly higher than did T-Mobile customers. The strong Virgin brand image appeared to cast a halo over its different service offerings, literally causing consumers to change their impressions of product performance.<sup>6</sup>
