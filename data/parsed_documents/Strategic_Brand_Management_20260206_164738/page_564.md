## 4. Understand Where You Can Take a Brand (and How)

For long-term financial prosperity, the successful launch of new products and services and the entry of existing products and services into new markets and customer segments are of paramount importance. From a branding standpoint, growth requires a well-thought-out and well-implemented brand architecture strategy that clarifies three key issues: (1) the potential of a brand in terms of the breadth of its “market footprint”; (2) the types of product and service extensions that would allow a brand to achieve that potential; and (3) the brand elements, positioning, and images that identify and are associated with all the offerings of a brand in different markets and to different consumers.

### Brand Potential.

A good brand architecture defines brand “boundaries”: what products or services the brand could represent, what benefits it could supply, and what needs it could satisfy. It provides “guardrails” for appropriate—and inappropriate—line and category extensions. It clarifies the meaning and promise of the brand to consumers and helps consumers choose the right version of the product or service for themselves.

Understanding the brand promise and how it should best be translated and adapted to different products and markets is challenging, but critical. Every product or service sharing the brand name should deliver on the unique brand promise. If you can replace the specific brand in any of its marketing with a competitive brand, and its marketing would still essentially make sense and “work” with consumers, then the marketing is probably not aligned sharply enough with the brand promise and meaning.

By adhering to the brand promise and growing the brand carefully through little steps, marketers can cover a lot of ground. For example, as Chapter 11 described, when Crayola When Crayola redefined itself as “colorful arts and crafts for kids,” the boundaries of the brand expanded considerably.
