This table outlines a three-stage model related to brand knowledge, likely depicting a process or a comparative framework. It begins with "Current Brand Knowledge," representing the existing understanding or perception of a brand. This is followed by "Desired Brand Knowledge," indicating the target or aspirational state of understanding and perception for the brand. The third component, "Communication," acts as the mechanism or bridge connecting the current state to the desired state. The numerical ordering (1, 2, 3) suggests a sequential flow, implying that communication efforts are employed to move from current brand knowledge to the desired brand knowledge. This structure highlights the role of communication in shaping and evolving brand perception towards a specific objective.

1. What is your current brand knowledge? Have you created a detailed mental map?

2. What is your desired brand knowledge? Have you defined optimal points-of-parity and points-of-difference and a brand mantra?

3. How does the communication option help the brand get from current to desired knowledge with consumers? Have you clarified the specific effects on knowledge engendered by communications?

### Information Processing Model of Communications.

To provide some perspective, let’s consider in more depth the process by which marketing communications might affect consumers. A number of different models have been put forth over the years to explain communications and the steps in the persuasion process—recall the discussion on the hierarchy of effects model from Brand Focus 2.0. For example, for a person to be persuaded by any form of communication (a TV advertisement, newspaper editorial, or blog posting), the following six steps must occur:<sup>4</sup>

1. *Exposure:* A person must see or hear the communication.  
2. *Attention:* A person must notice the communication.  
3. *Comprehension:* A person must understand the intended message or arguments of the communication.  
4. *Yielding:* A person must respond favorably to the intended message or arguments of the communication.  
5. *Intentions:* A person must plan to act in the desired manner of the communication.  
6. *Behavior:* A person must actually act in the desired manner of the communication.

You can appreciate the challenge of creating a successful marketing communication program when you realize that each of the six steps must occur for a consumer to be persuaded. If there is a breakdown or failure in any step along the way, then successful communication will not result. For example, consider the potential pitfalls in launching a new advertising campaign:

1. A consumer may not be exposed to an ad because the media plan missed the mark.  
2. A consumer may not notice an ad because of a boring and uninspired creative strategy.  
3. A consumer may not understand an ad because of a lack of product category knowledge or technical sophistication, or because of a lack of awareness and familiarity about the brand itself.  
4. A consumer may fail to respond favorably and form a positive attitude because of irrelevant or unconvincing product claims.  
5. A consumer may fail to form a purchase intention because of a lack of an immediate perceived need.  
6. A consumer may fail to actually buy the product because he or she doesn’t remember anything from the ad when confronted with the available brands in the store.

To show how fragile the whole communication process is, assume that the probability of *each* of the six steps being successfully accomplished is 50 percent—most likely an extremely generous assumption. The laws of probability suggest that the likelihood of all six steps successfully occurring, assuming they are independent events, is

$$
0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 1.5625\%
$$

If the probability of each step’s occurring, on average, were a more pessimistic 10 percent, then the joint probability of all six events occurring is .000001. In other words, only 1 in 1,000,000! No wonder advertisers sometimes lament the limited power of advertising.
