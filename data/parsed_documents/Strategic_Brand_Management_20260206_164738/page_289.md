UPS also chose the Beijing games to strengthen its brand presence in China. UPS was a global Olympic sponsor in 1996, 1998, and 2000 but then dropped out of the Games after 2000, saying its brand awareness goals had been achieved. But in 2005, UPS announced it would rejoin the Olympics for 2008, this time in a limited deal that allowed the company to use the Olympic logo for marketing in China only—not in the United States. International and local sponsors were estimated to have spent a total of $1 billion on the Beijing Olympics, aided partly by the nationalist spirit that drove some Chinese companies to sponsor the Games.

## London 2012 Summer Games

Every Olympic Games also presents the opportunity to learn from past successes and mistakes and to run an event that will benefit athletes, spectators, viewers, and sponsors alike. Recognizing the important financial contribution of sponsorship, the London Games were supported by the British government’s introduction of extensive antiambush legislation. Banned were activities such as sky-writing, flyers, posters, billboards, and projected advertising within 200 meters of any Olympic venue. The government also passed legislation to forbid a variety of words such as “Games,” “2012,” “Two Thousand and Twelve,” and “Twenty Twelve” to be used in combination with words such as, “Gold,” “Silver,” “Bronze,” “London,” “Medals,” “Sponsor,” or “Summer” in an unauthorized manner such that general public would think there was an association with the London Olympics.<sup>59</sup>

Ticket revenue is also critical to the success of the Olympics, so organizers of the London Games also embarked on a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, “The Greatest Tickets on Earth,” in hope of raising £500 million from ticket sales. Twelve ads showcased likely Olympic stars, including local favorites gymnast Beth Tweddle and diver Tom Daley. Over half of all tickets to the most popular events, however, were earmarked for corporate sponsors and their employees or guests.<sup>60</sup>

Outside the country, the government also embarked on a “Visit Britain” and “Visit London” promotional campaign to attract tourists. The campaigns set out strategically to emphasize the “timeless,” “dynamic,” and “genuine” qualities—based on the people, places, and culture—that define the British brand.<sup>61</sup>

## City and Country Effects

Another hotly debated Olympics topic is the value of the payback to the host city, region, and country. Bringing an aggressive new sponsorship approach to the Los Angeles Olympics resulted in those Games being a financial success, but other Games since then have been a mixed bag. However, a number of benefits may be evident for a host country that can be hard to quantify.<sup>62</sup>

One important psychological benefit is civic pride and patriotism for serving as host to such an iconic global sporting event. With a worldwide television audience for two weeks and more, the Games also serve as a huge advertising and public relations opportunity to aid tourism, real estate, and commercial business. Both the 1992 Barcelona and 2000 Sydney Games enjoyed these broad sets of benefits.

Another often-overlooked benefit is the investment in improving infrastructure that often leads up to hosting the Games. Beijing added new subway lines, highways, an airport to ease transportation, and new parks alongside to add to the scenery, providing some badly needed improvements in transportation and quality of life for residents of the city.

Nevertheless, the financial stakes are high, and only careful planning and execution and the right circumstances can result in success for the Olympics host city, region, and country. The 1976 Montreal and 2004 Athens Games, for example, had a much less positive effect on the host countries. It took Montreal almost 30 years to pay back the $2.7 billion in debt it incurred in hosting the Games.

## Summary

Olympic sponsorship remains highly controversial. Many corporate sponsors continue to believe that their Olympic sponsorship yields many significant benefits, creating an image of goodwill for their brand, serving as a platform to enhance awareness and communicate messages, and affording numerous opportunities to reward employees and entertain clients. Others view the Games as overly commercialized, despite the measures undertaken by the IOC and USOC to portray the Olympics as wholesome. In any case, the success of Olympic sponsorship—like that of any sports sponsorship—depends in large part on how well it is executed and incorporated into the entire marketing plan.
