# DISADVANTAGES OF BRAND EXTENSIONS

Despite their potential advantages, brand extensions have a number of disadvantages (see Figure 12-4).

### Can Confuse or Frustrate Consumers

Different varieties of line extensions may confuse and perhaps even frustrate consumers about which version of the product is the “right one” for them. With 16 varieties of Coke and 35 versions of Crest toothpaste, consumers can easily feel overwhelmed.²² For example, one study found that consumers were more likely to make a purchase after sampling a product (and being given a coupon) when there were six product flavors to sample than when there were 24.²³

So, in some situations, greater product variety may induce shoppers to buy less. Consumers may reject new extensions for tried and true favorites or all-purpose versions that claim to supersede more specialized product versions. The global success of Colgate Total is certainly due in part to its positioning—reflected in its name—as an inclusive product that contains all the necessary or desirable toothpaste benefits.

Many retailers do not have enough shelf or display space to stock the large number of new products and brands continually being introduced even if they wanted to. So some consumers may be disappointed when they’re unable to find an advertised brand extension because a retailer is unable or unwilling to stock it. If a firm launches extensions that consumers deem inappropriate, they may question the integrity and competence of the brand.

Figure 12-4 outlines the potential disadvantages associated with brand extension. These drawbacks can manifest in several ways, including consumer confusion or frustration, and retailer resistance. Furthermore, brand extensions carry the risk of failure, which can negatively impact the parent brand's image. Even successful extensions can lead to unintended consequences such as cannibalizing sales of the parent brand, diminishing the brand's identification with a specific category, or diluting the overall brand meaning. Finally, pursuing brand extensions might cause a company to miss opportunities for developing entirely new brands. The number of consumer packaged-goods stock-keeping units (SKUs) outpaces the growth of retail space in year-on-year percentage growth.
