Unlike the Foursquare app, the Shopkick app lets marketers know when users are actually inside a store, not just nearby. Users can scan bar codes at participating stores—Macy’s, Best Buy, Target—to earn “kickbucks,” reward points toward gift certificates. Retailers pay Shopkick to be included in the app and featured in special promotions. Costing less than $1 per user store visit, “It definitely drove traffic into the stores,” as one participating CMO noted. Different shopping behaviors—trying on clothes, inspecting a product, and so on—earn different points. Ten percent of users reportedly use the app every single day.⁷⁵

Online retailers are also recognizing the power of m-commerce—selling through mobile devices—by launching mobile apps and revamping online stores to handle mobile traffic more easily. In 2010, eBay estimated it had sold $1.5 billion worth of goods over mobile devices. At Gilt, as much as 20 percent of revenue comes from mobile devices on nights and weekends.⁷⁶

Several years ago, the idea of mobile marketing was met with fear that marketers would alienate customers with annoying product pitches. But creative messages that pull willing consumers into dialogue with the brand have evolved into an appealing way to increase brand awareness, especially when it is part of a larger campaign in other media.

# BRAND AMPLIFIERS

Complementing these four broad sets of marketing communication activities are efforts to engage consumers and the public via word-of-mouth and public relations and publicity. Although they can perform many different functions, they are especially well-suited at amplifying the effects created by other marketing activities.⁷⁷

## Public Relations and Publicity

Public relations and publicity relate to a variety of programs and are designed to promote or protect a company’s image or its individual products. *Publicity* is nonpersonal communications such as press releases, media interviews, press conferences, feature articles, newsletters, photographs, films, and tapes. *Public relations* may also include annual reports, fund-raising and membership drives, lobbying, special event management, and public affairs.

The marketing value of public relations got a big boost in 1983 when public relations firm Burson-Marsteller’s skillful handling of Johnson & Johnson’s Tylenol product tampering incident was credited with helping to save the brand. Brand Focus 11.0 provides a comprehensive account of that landmark campaign. Around that time, politicians also discovered the power of campaign sound bites that were picked up by the press as a means of broad, cost-efficient candidate exposure.

Marketers now recognize that although public relations are invaluable during a marketing crisis, it also needs to be a routine part of any marketing communications program. Even companies that primarily use advertising and promotions can benefit from well-conceived and well-executed publicity. Winner of *PR Week*’s Campaign of the Year for 2011, Mattel’s PR campaign for the Barbie “I Can Be . . .” career doll line let young girls vote for the first time on the 50-year old doll’s next career move. Over 1 million online votes were cast, and after 125 different careers—including astronaut, veterinarian, and even U.S. president—the winning job was computer engineer. The buzz behind the campaign increased sales and expanded the brand outside its core territory.⁷⁸

## Word-of-Mouth

Publicity and PR often serve another important role—they get people talking. Word-of-mouth is a critical aspect of brand building as consumers share their likes, dislikes, and experiences with brands with each other.⁷⁹ The power of word-of-mouth is the credibility and relevance it often brings. Study after study has shown that the most trusted source of product information is friends and families.

If marketers do their job right and create marketing programs that offer consumers superior delivery of desired benefits, people will write and talk about the brand, amplifying any marketing effects. In effect, a buzz has been created among consumers. Companies are attempting to create this consumer word-of-mouth through various techniques often called *buzz marketing*.⁸⁰

Established companies do not have the luxury of time, so they often attempt to catalyze the buzz marketing effect for new product introductions. One popular method is to allow consumers who are likely to influence other consumers to “discover” the product in the hopes that they will pass a positive endorsement on to their peers. Procter & Gamble has created a program specifically designed to enhance buzz.
