Assuming marketers use some type of sub-branding strategy for two or more brand levels, two general principles—relevance and differentiation—should guide them at each level of the brand knowledge creation process.

The *principle of relevance* is based on the advantages of efficiency and economy. Marketers should create associations that are relevant to as many brands nested at the level below as possible, especially at the corporate or family brand level. The greater the value of an association in the firm’s marketing, the more efficient and economical it is to consolidate this meaning into one brand linked to all these products.  
For example, Nike’s slogan (“Just Do It”) reinforces a key point-of-difference for the brand—performance—that is relevant to virtually every product it sells.

The more abstract the association, the more likely it is to be relevant in different product settings. Thus, benefit associations are likely to be extremely advantageous because they can cut across many product categories. For brands with strong product category and attribute associations, however, it can be difficult to create a brand image robust enough to extend into new categories.

For example, Blockbuster struggled to expand its meaning from “a place to rent videos” to “your neighborhood entertainment center” in hopes of creating a broader brand umbrella with greater relevance to more products. It eventually declared bankruptcy before being acquired via auction by satellite television provider Dish Network in April 2011.

The *principle of differentiation* is based on the disadvantages of redundancy. Marketers should distinguish brands at the same level as much as possible. If they cannot easily distinguish two brands, it may be difficult for retailers or other channel members to justify supporting both, and for consumers to choose between them.

Although new products and brand extensions are critical to keeping a brand innovative and relevant, marketers must introduce them thoughtfully and selectively. Without restraint, brand variations can easily get out of control.

A grocery store can stock as many as 40,000 items, which raises the question: Do consumers really need nine kinds of Kleenex tissues, Eggo waffles in 16 flavors, and 72 varieties of Pantene shampoo, all of which have been available at one point in time? To better control its inventory and avoid brand proliferation, Colgate-Palmolive began to discontinue one item for each product it introduces.

Although the principle of differentiation is especially important at the individual brand or modifier levels, it’s also valid at the family brand level. For example, one of the criticisms of marketing at General Motors was that the company had failed to adequately distinguish its family brands of automobiles, perhaps ultimately leading to the demise of the Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Saturn brands.

The principle of differentiation also implies that not all products should receive the same emphasis at any level of the hierarchy. A key issue in designing a brand hierarchy is thus choosing the relative emphasis to place on the different products in it. If a corporate or family brand is associated with multiple products, which product should be the core or flagship product? What product should represent “the brand” to consumers?

A *flagship product* is one that best represents or embodies the brand to consumers. It is often the first product by which the brand gained fame, a widely accepted best seller, or a highly admired or award-winning product. For example, although other products are associated with their brands, flagship products might be soap for Ivory, credit cards for American Express, and cake mix for Betty Crocker.

Flagship products play a key role in the brand portfolio in that marketing them can have short-term benefits (increased sales), as well as long-term benefits (improved brand equity). Chrysler put a lot of marketing effort behind its 300 models when they were hot sellers even though they made up only 22 percent of the brand’s total sales, because the 300 also appeared to provide a halo over the rest of the Chrysler line. At a time when General Motors sales were declining by 4 percent, Chrysler’s sales shot up 10 percent.

**Combining Brand Elements from Different Levels.**  
If we combine multiple brand elements from different levels of the brand hierarchy, we must decide how much emphasis to give each. For example, if we adopt a sub-brand strategy, how much prominence should we give individual brands at the expense of the corporate or family brand?

</page_header> The *prominence* of a brand element is its relative visibility compared with other brand elements.
