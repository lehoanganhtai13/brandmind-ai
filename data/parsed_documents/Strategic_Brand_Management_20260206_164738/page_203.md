homes accompany a hamburger or other sandwich, but only 3 percent of all sandwiches consumed are served with pickles. Compounding the consumption problem is a shopping obstacle. Pickles typically are stocked in the center aisles of stores, where only about 20 percent of shoppers turn on any given trip, compared with the produce or deli aisles on the perimeter of the store, where about 60 percent shop. Vlasic did have one advantage with which to work. Through the years, its iconic brand character—a stork with a Groucho Marx look and personality—had become widely recognizable from all its advertising appearances. For the 2011 summer selling season, Vlasic decided to pull all those factors together to try something different in its marketing. In-store ad cutouts with the stork began to appear in sections of the supermarket away from where pickles were stocked. In the meat section, for example, an ad was placed that included a speech balloon near the stork’s beak proclaiming: 

> **Pro tip: Serve your burgers with a Vlasic pickle.  
> Amateur tip: Don’t.**

Similar type ads appeared near the hamburger buns in the bread aisle and all through the cheese aisles. The ads also appeared on shopping carts and on vinyl ads on the supermarket floor. To provide further marketing support outside the store, print ads for the brand stating “Bring On the Bite” appeared in magazines and on Web sites.

Such collaborative efforts can spur greater sales of a brand. Yet, at the same time, much conflict has also emerged in recent years between manufacturers and the retailers making up their channels of distribution. Because of greater competition for shelf space among what many retailers feel are increasingly undifferentiated brands, retailers have gained power and are now in a better position to set the terms of trade with manufacturers. Increased power means that retailers can command more frequent and lucrative trade promotions.

One way for manufacturers to regain some of their lost leverage is to create strong brands through some of the brand-building tactics described in this book, for example, by selling innovative and unique products—properly priced and advertised—that consumers demand. In this way, consumers may ask or even pressure retailers to stock and promote manufacturers’ products.

By devoting marketing efforts to the end consumer, a manufacturer is said to employ a *pull strategy*, since consumers use their buying power and influence on retailers to “pull” the product through the channel. Alternatively, marketers can devote their selling efforts to the channel members themselves, providing direct incentives for them to stock and sell products to the end consumer. This approach is called a *push strategy*, because the manufacturer is attempting to reach the consumer by “pushing” the product through each step of the distribution chain.

Although certain brands seem to emphasize one strategy more than another (push strategies are usually associated with more selective distribution, and pull strategies with broader, more intensive distribution), the most successful marketers—brands like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike—skillfully blend push *and* pull strategies.
