First, we’ll briefly review the CBBE framework. Next, we highlight managerial guidelines and key themes that emerged in previous chapters and summarize some success factors for branding. Toward that goal, we’ll present the brand report card to help brand managers understand and rate their brands’ performance on key branding dimensions, as well as the seven deadly sins of brand management. We’ll conclude by considering specific applications of branding in different types of industries in Brand Focus 15.0.

## STRATEGIC BRAND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

### Summary of Customer-Based Brand Equity Framework

**Strategic brand management** includes the design and implementation of marketing programs and activities to build, measure, and manage brand equity. Before we review some guidelines for strategic brand management, let’s briefly summarize—one last time!—the customer-based brand equity framework.

The rationale behind the framework is to recognize the importance of the customer in the creation and management of brand equity. As one top marketing executive put it: “Consumers own brands, and your brand is what consumers will permit you to have.” Consistent with this view, we defined customer-based brand equity in Chapter 2 as the differential effect that consumers’ brand knowledge has on their response to the marketing of that brand. A brand has positive customer-based brand equity if customers react more favorably to a product and the way it is marketed when the brand is identified, than when the product carries a fictitious name or no name.

The basic premise of customer-based brand equity is thus that the power of a brand lies in the minds and hearts of consumers, and what they’ve experienced, learned, and felt about the brand over time. More formally, we described brand knowledge in Chapter 2 in terms of an associative network memory model, in which the brand is like a node in memory with a variety of different types of associations linked to it. As summarized in Figure 15-1, brand knowledge has two components: brand awareness and brand image.

**Brand awareness** is related to the strength of the brand node or trace in memory, as reflected by consumers’ ability to recall or recognize the brand under different conditions. Brand awareness has depth and breadth. Depth describes the likelihood that consumers can recognize or recall the brand. Breadth describes the variety of purchase and consumption situations in which the brand comes to mind.

This table outlines the components of Brand Knowledge, which encompasses Brand Awareness, Attributes, Benefits, and Attitudes. Brand Awareness is further divided into Brand Recall and Brand Recognition. Brand Knowledge also includes Brand Image, which is characterized by the Favorability, Strength, and Uniqueness of brand associations. Attributes are categorized into Non-product-related and Product-related types. Benefits are classified as Functional, Experiential, and Symbolic. Finally, Attitudes represent the overall evaluation of the brand. The structure suggests a hierarchical breakdown of Brand Knowledge, with Brand Image acting as a significant component influencing the other elements. **Brand image** is consumer perceptions of and preferences for a brand, measured by the various types of brand associations held in memory.
