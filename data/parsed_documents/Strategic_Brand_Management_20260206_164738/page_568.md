## Brand Balance

Trade-offs are pervasive in marketing a brand—short-run sales versus long-run brand equity, global control vs. local customization, retaining vs. acquiring customers, to name just a few.

The art and science of modern brand marketing is to fully understand and creatively address these significant branding trade-offs. To do so, companies have employed a variety of strategies: breakthrough product or service innovations, improved business models, expanded or leveraged resources, enhanced or embellished marketing, perceptual framing to overcome misperceptions, or just sheer creativity and inspiration.

For example, the trade-off between sales-generating and brand-building activities requires that marketing communications affect both the short run (sales) and the long run (brand building). Firms have addressed this in different ways: California’s “Got milk?” campaign entertained consumers and sold milk; P&G’s Ivory promotional campaign challenged consumers to find one of the few bars that was weighted to sink in the bathtub, reinforcing the key attribute of floating; the BMW film series, *The Hire* developed equity building communications by highlighting BMW performance aspects in short videos created by leading filmmakers.

Another trade-off focuses on points-of-difference and points-of-parity. To be effectively positioned, the brand must have points-of-difference (PODs) where it excels, and at least points-of-parity versus competitors where it may be seen as inferior. Volvo and Quicken approached this challenge by developing unique PODs (safety and ease of use, respectively), as well as parity with competitors on key points (for Volvo, style; for Quicken, performance). When the first Apple computer launched, it was so easy to use the market thought it must not be powerful. Apple reframed that negative perception by redefining the idea of power: power is not what is inside the computer, but what you can do with it.

In developing solutions to achieve balance in branding, it is important:  
(1) not to oversimplify branding so that all the richness is stripped away but, at the same time;  
(2) not to overcomplicate branding such that marketers and other employees are overwhelmed by the complexity.  

The optimal branding approach recognizes that many different aspects of branding matter; the imperatives we’ve discussed above point the way to the most critical.

## New Capabilities for Brand Marketers

We’ll make one final observation, based on the need to better reconcile marketing trade-offs in branding: the talents and abilities of brand managers have necessarily evolved. Marketers require more skills in their toolkits than were necessary only 10 years ago.

Today’s brand marketers must know all the usual marketing fundamentals but also embellish those skills in important ways. For example, they must at least have cultural skills to understand the diversity of the new consumer; fluency in working with design techniques and designers; IT and Internet skills to understand Web-related marketing activities; an appreciation of new branding models and formal qualitative and quantitative measurement methods; and creativity to devise holistic solutions. These are challenging requirements, but also very exciting opportunities as marketers adopt higher standards in brand management excellence.

## REVIEW

The challenges and complexities of the modern marketplace make efficient and effective marketing an imperative. The businesses that win in the twenty-first century will be those whose marketers successfully build, measure, and manage brand equity. This final chapter reviewed some of the important guidelines put forth in this text to help in that endeavor.

Effective brand management requires consistent application of these guidelines across all aspects of the marketing program. Nevertheless, to some extent, rules are made to be broken, and the guidelines can be only a point of departure in the challenging process of creating a world-class brand. Each branding situation and application is unique and requires careful scrutiny and analysis about how best to apply, or perhaps in some cases ignore, these various recommendations and guidelines. Smart marketers will capitalize on every tool at their disposal—and devise new ones—in their relentless pursuit of brand preeminence.
