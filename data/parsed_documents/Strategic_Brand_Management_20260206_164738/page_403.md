> Guidelines for Brand Hierarchy Decisions

1. **Decide on which products are to be introduced.**  
* Principle of growth: Invest in market penetration or expansion vs. product development according to ROI opportunities.  
* Principle of survival: Brand extensions must achieve brand equity in their categories.  
* Principle of synergy: Brand extensions should enhance the equity of the parent brand.

2. **Decide on the number of levels.**  
* Principle of simplicity: Employ as few levels as possible.  
* Principle of clarity: Logic and relationship of all brand elements employed must be obvious and transparent.

3. **Decide on the levels of awareness and types of associations to be created at each level.**  
* Principle of relevance: Create abstract associations that are relevant across as many individual items as possible.  
* Principle of differentiation: Differentiate individual items and brands.

4. **Decide on how to link brands from different levels for a product.**  
* Principle of prominence: The relative prominence of brand elements affects perceptions of product distance and the type of image created for new products.

5. **Decide on how to link a brand across products.**  
* Principle of commonality: The more common elements products share, the stronger the linkages.

Brand elements at each level of the hierarchy may contribute to brand equity through their ability to create awareness as well as foster strong, favorable, and unique brand associations and positive responses. The challenge in setting up a brand hierarchy is to decide:

1. The specific products to be introduced for any one brand.  
2. The number of levels of the hierarchy to use.  
3. The desired brand awareness and image at each level.  
4. The combinations of brand elements from different levels of the hierarchy, if any, to use for any one particular product.  
5. The best way to link any one brand element, if at all, to multiple products.

The following discussion reviews these five decisions. Figure 11-6 summarizes guidelines in each of these areas to assist in the design of brand hierarchies.

### Specific Products to Introduce.

Consistent with discussions in other chapters about what products a firm should introduce for any one brand, we can note three principles here.

The *principle of growth* maintains that investments in market penetration or expansion versus product development for a brand should be made according to ROI opportunities. In other words, firms must make cost–benefit calculations for investing resources in selling more of a brand’s existing products to new customers versus launching new products for the brand.

In seeing its traditional networking business slow down, Cisco decided to bet big on new Internet video products. Although video has become more pervasive in almost all media (cell phones, Internet, etc.), the bulky size of files creates transmission challenges. Cisco launched Telepresence technology to permit high-definition videoconferencing for its corporate customers and is infusing its entire product line with greater video capabilities through its medianet architecture.<sup>18</sup>

The other two principles address the dynamics of brand extension success, as developed in great detail in Chapter 12. The *principle of survival* states that brand extensions must achieve brand equity in their categories. In other words, “me too” extensions must be avoided. The *principle of synergy* states that brand extensions should also enhance the equity of the parent brand.

### Number of Levels of the Brand Hierarchy.

Given product boundaries and an extension strategy in place for a brand, the first decision to make in defining a branding strategy is, broadly, which level or levels of the branding hierarchy to use. Most firms choose to use more than one level, for two main reasons.
