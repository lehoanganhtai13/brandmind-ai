Sood and Keller found that “branding effects” in terms of inferences based on parent brand knowledge operated both in the absence and presence of product experience with an extension, although they were less pronounced or, in the case of an unambiguous negative experience, even nonexistent.<sup>110</sup>  

In considering the effects of retailer displays, Buchanan, Simmons, and Bickart found that evaluations of a high-equity brand could be diminished by an unfamiliar competitive brand when  
(1) a mixed display structure led consumers to believe the competitive brand was relevant and useful for judging the high-equity brand,  
(2) the precedence given to one brand over another in the display made expectations about brand differences or similarities more evident to consumers, and  
(3) the unfamiliar competitive brand disconfirmed these expectations.<sup>111</sup>  

**15. Individual differences can affect how consumers make an extension decision and will moderate extension effects.** Consumers vary in their short-term or long-term motivation, ability, and opportunity to evaluate an extension in a number of important ways. Researchers have shown how these differences can affect extension fit and evaluations, as follows.  

Monga and John demonstrate that one important individual difference in extension evaluations is whether consumers are analytical or holistic thinkers. *Analytic thinkers* focus more on comparing specific attributes or benefits of the parent brand and extension; *holistic thinkers* focus more on comparing overall attitudes and judgments of the parent brand and extension. Analytical and holistic thinkers both gave prestige brands permission to extend widely, but holistic thinkers gave functional brands much greater permission to extend than analytical thinkers.<sup>112</sup>  

Similarly, Yorkston, Nunes, and Matta show that consumers known as *incremental theorists*, who believe the personality traits of a brand are malleable, are more accepting of brand extensions than consumers known as *entity theorists*, who believe a brand’s traits are fixed.<sup>113</sup>  

Another important individual difference relates to *self-construal*, or how people view and make sense of life and their life.<sup>114</sup> A person with an *independent self-construal* is more concerned with the uniqueness of individuals; a person with an *interdependent self-construal* is more concerned with relationships between and among individuals.  

In a branding context, Ahluwalia posited that a consumer with an interdependent self-construal should be better able to uncover the possible relationships among a brand extension and its parent brand and thus have higher perceptions of extension fit and favorability. In her study, these effects were observed as long as consumers with interdependent self-construal were sufficiently motivated.<sup>115</sup>  

Similarly, Puligadda, Ross, and Grewal argue that *brand-schematic* consumers are more likely than others to process or organize information according to their brand knowledge. *Brand-aschematic* consumers, on the other hand, use other information such as product characteristics or attributes as a frame of reference. Brand schematic consumers were shown to be more likely to see the similarity in a brand extension concept.<sup>116</sup>  

Another important individual difference between consumers is what academics call *regulatory focus*. This deals with motivation and how people go about pursuing their goals. Individuals with a *prevention focus* are concerned with negative outcomes and avoiding losses via safety, security, responsibility, and so on. Individuals with a *promotion focus* are concerned with positive outcomes, seeking gains and pleasure and avoiding missed opportunities.<sup>117</sup>  

Yeo and Park showed that consumers who are focused on prevention tend to judge dissimilar extensions less favorably than consumers who focus on promotion, due to their different interpretations of risk.<sup>118</sup> Relatedly, Chang, Lin, and Chang showed that promotion-focused consumers are more likely to focus abstractly on the overlap in benefits in judging an extension, whereas prevention-focused consumers are more likely to focus concretely on sheer category similarity.<sup>119</sup>  

Temporal factors can affect extension evaluations. Barone, Miniard, and Romeo experimentally demonstrated that positive mood led consumers to think more positively of extensions they viewed as moderately similar to a brand they valuated favorably (as opposed to very similar or dissimilar).<sup>120</sup> 16.
