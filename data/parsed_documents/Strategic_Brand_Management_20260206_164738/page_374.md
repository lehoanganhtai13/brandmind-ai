assets and the price paid––was often enormous and negatively affecting the balance sheet. News Corporation used the recognition that the titles themselves contained much of the value of the acquisition to justify placing them on the balance sheet, improving the debt/equity ratio and allowing the company to get some much-needed cash to finance acquisition of some foreign media companies.

In the United Kingdom, Grand Metropolitan was one of the first British companies to place a monetary value on the brands it owned and to put that value on its balance sheet. When Grand Met acquired Heublein distributors, Pearle eye care, and Sambuca Romana liqueur in 1987, it placed the value of some of its brands––principally Smirnoff––on the balance sheet for roughly $1 billion. In doing so, Grand Met used two different methods. If a company consisted of primarily one brand, it figured that the value of the brand was 75 percent of the purchase price, whereas if the company had many brands, it used a multiple of an income figure.

British firms used brand values primarily to boost their balance sheets. By recording their brand assets, the firms maintained, they were attempting to bring their shareholder funds nearer to the market capitalization of the firm. In the United Kingdom, Rank Hovis McDougal (RHM) succeeded in putting the worth of the company’s existing brands as a figure on the balance sheet to fight a hostile takeover bid in 1988. With the brand value information provided by Interbrand, the RHM board was able to go back to investors and argue that the bid was too low, and eventually to repel it.

Accounting firms in favor of valuing brands argue that it is a way to strengthen the presentation of a company’s accounts, to record hidden assets so they are disclosed to company’s shareholders, to enhance a company’s shareholders’ funds to improve its earnings ratios, to provide a realistic basis for management and investors to measure a company’s performance, and to reveal detailed information on brand strengths so that management can formulate appropriate brand strategies. In practical terms, however, recording brand value as an intangible asset from the firm’s perspective is a means to increase the asset value of the firm.

Actual practices have varied from country to country. Brand valuations have been accepted for inclusion in the balance sheets of companies in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France, Sweden, Singapore, and Spain. In the United Kingdom, Martin Sorrell improved the balance sheet of WPP by attaching brand value to its primary assets, including J. Walter Thompson Company, Ogilvy & Mather, and Hill & Knowlton, stating in the annual report that:

> Intangible fixed assets comprise certain acquired separable corporate brand names.  
> These are shown at a valuation of the incremental earnings expected to arise from the ownership of brands. The valuations have been based on the present value of notional royalty savings arising from [ownership] and on estimates of profits attributable to brand loyalty.<sup>32</sup> In the United States, generally accepted accounting principles (blanket amortization principles) mean that placing a brand on the balance sheet would require amortization of that asset for up to 40 years.
