# BRANDING BRIEF 12-3

## Mambo Extends Its Brand

Launched in 1984, the company works with many talented artists from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, putting art onto anything that can be worn, hung, ridden, driven, or played. In the 80s and 90s, Mambo offered often controversial cultural commentary on T-shirts, but the year 2000 and the Sydney Olympics in Australia saw the iconic brand as the provider of not only the uniform of the typical Aussie surfer, but also the official uniform of the Australian Olympians.

Twelve years later and Mambo is one of Australia’s most influential brands alongside Nike and Adidas. Like many other companies, Mambo too, however, has struggled after tough economic times. As part of a retail strategy that aimed at widening its sales base and increasing annual revenue, the company sought to expand its range of products by adding Mambo surf-wear brand to Big W’s clothing range in Australia (a Woolworth’s discount department store chain).

Under the new retail strategy, the Mambo range at Big W comprises men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing, including sunglasses and footwear, as well as sporting gear, such as surfboards and skateboards. For Big W, the introduction of the Mambo brand meant a way for Big W to differentiate itself from competitors who focus on bargain-priced private labels. Adding Mambo to its clothing range meant that customers could be assured quality through a well-known brand, which in turn reiterates value when coupled with the competitive pricing offered at this type of discount store.

However, just a few weeks after the introduction of the Mambo clothing line to Big W, a T-shirt design that had first appeared in 1986 proved too controversial to be sold in the discount department store. The shirt bearing an irreverent tagline and artwork was withdrawn following a complaint from a customer in a Big W store.

It seemed that for Mambo a simple vertical extension of the original brand would not be possible in this case. In order to reach a broader market (outside of like-minded surf enthusiasts), Mambo has had to include new designs in its range, but has been able to keep some of the less controversial, well-renowned designs from Mambo’s back catalogue (including its notorious “farting dog”).

In order for the parent brand image not to be cheapened or tarnished by introduction of Mambo products to the discount department chain, the range included at Big W does not include premium Mambo Goddess and Mambo Surf Deluxe collections or controversial products, such as Reg Mombassa’s “Australian Jesus.”
