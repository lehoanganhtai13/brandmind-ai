# ETISALAT: “MORE TO LIFE” CAMPAIGN

Etisalat, one of Egypt’s well-known mobile operators, have marketed themselves as a company that provides simplicity through their offers. Most of their marketing campaigns had been focused on “value.” In an attempt to differentiate its creative strategy and grab customer attention, the company launched their second marketing strategy in 2010. Given the country’s conditions and overall air of pessimism, the company wanted to build a strong leading corporate creative strategy based on promoting their original values of quality and simplicity within a total IMC campaign promoting “optimism in life.” The campaign slogan was “More to Life.” The campaign advertisement was launched for two months and was endorsed by six celebrities: singers and actors who are loved by the mass public. The celebrities sang the creative message in an unforgettable jingle that became well known by most ad viewers. The campaign was run consistently on TV, radio, magazines, outdoors, on in-store mock-ups, and inserted in VIP customer bills. Overall, the 2010 campaign was a huge success in boosting consumer awareness and attachment to the Etisalat brand to the extent that the brand recommendation rate had gone up from 27 to 31 percent.¹¹

What makes an effective TV ad?¹² Fundamentally, a TV ad should contribute to brand equity in some demonstrable way, for example, by enhancing awareness, strengthening a key association or adding a new association, or eliciting a positive consumer response. Earlier, we identified six broad information-processing factors as affecting the success of advertising: consumer targeting, the ad creative, consumer understanding, brand positioning, consumer motivation, and ad memorability.

Although managerial judgment using criteria such as these can and should be employed in evaluating advertising, research also can play a productive role. Advertising strategy research is often invaluable in clarifying communication objectives, target markets, and positioning alternatives. To evaluate the effectiveness of message and creative strategies, *copy testing* is often conducted, in which a sample of consumers is exposed to candidate ads and their reactions are gauged in some manner.

Unfortunately, copy-testing results vary considerably depending on exactly how tests are conducted. Consequently, the results must be interpreted as only one possible data point that should be combined with managerial judgment and other information in evaluating the merits of an ad. Copy testing is perhaps most useful when managerial judgment reveals some fairly clear positive and negative aspects to an ad and is therefore somewhat inconclusive. In this case, copy-testing research may shed some light on how these various conflicting aspects “net out” and collectively affect consumer processing.
