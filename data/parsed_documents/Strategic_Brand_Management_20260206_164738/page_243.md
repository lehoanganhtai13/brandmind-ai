# BRANDING BRIEF 6-1

## Brand Building via the X Games

Although the action sports industry contains a variety of high-energy and sometimes potentially high-risk sports, it is largely defined by various forms of skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, and BMX biking. Action sports continue on a growth trajectory in terms of legitimacy, participation, public interest, and sponsor/business investment. They have become increasingly profitable, with skate, snow and surf gear, apparel, and accessories jumping from a $5 billion to an $11 billion market in the last eight years. Analysts predict that kind of exponential growth—although hard to track—reflects the future of action sports, as more youth and adults in the United States and globally become involved and retailers continue to evolve their brands.

ESPN’s X Games, begun as a biannual event in 1995, remain at the forefront of the industry. They are ESPN’s largest owned and operated property and are regarded as the gold standard in the action sports world. While the public initially saw the X Games as “the circus coming to town” or as a showcase for death-defying stunts and tricks, people have begun to realize that the riders are legitimate athletes in a sustainable business. Viewers 18 and younger, especially, have grown up with the X Games and consider it their own Olympics.⁶⁵

X Games quickly grew into a franchise that has staged more than 65 events attended by more than 2.5 million fans. It has successfully launched a variety of brand extensions in consumer products and home entertainment and touches all seven continents. ESPN believes the evolution and growth of all elements of the X Games have positioned it well for continued successes—in brand perception and relevance, live event attendance, record-setting broadcast viewership and ratings, increased sponsor investment, and overall popularity and incorporation into the mainstream. As one top X Games executive, Rick Alessandri, noted, X “represents the best in action sports, innovation, creativity, and progression. It’s constantly moving forward . . . we’re right on track. We’re going on the fifteenth year . . . sports get added and removed, new athletes come along . . . we’re continually evolving.”

The four-day and final attendance for X Games 17 in the summer of 2011 was 141,500 and included the following events:

* **BMX:** Big Air, Freestyle Vert, Park, Street  
* **Moto X:** Best Trick, Best Whip, Enduro X (Men’s and Women’s), Freestyle, Racing (Women’s), Speed & Style, Step Up  
* **Skateboard:** Big Air, Game of SK8, Park, Real Street, Street (Men’s & Women’s), Vert  
* **Rally:** Rally Car Racing, RallyCross  

Partners for X Games 17 in the summer of 2011 were chosen based on their ability to meet the various needs of the sponsors, the X Games franchise, and ESPN as a whole. Sponsors were eventually matched because:

* ESPN sales teams and agencies pitched the X Games property to sponsors based on perceived fit and common objectives.  
* Advertisers specifically requested X Games.  
* Advertisers wanted to target a certain demographic (males 18–34) and asked the ESPN sales team for recommendations.  
* Advertisers wanted to conduct a promotion/push a certain product or air commercials within a particular time, and X Games event timing matched.  
* Advertisers had a certain budget/amount of money to spend, and the ESPN sales team offered the X Games property based on that budget and the perceived fit.  

The final sponsor roster included partners that were culturally aligned with ESPN, the X Games franchise, and the parent Walt Disney Company, and that satisfied minimum investment criteria established by ESPN and X Games. Sponsors with adult-oriented products such as alcoholic beverages, for example, have traditionally not been included. Figure 6-5 provides some detail on the official and event sponsors.

The X Games, with top action-sports athletes like Shaun White, have been an excellent vehicle for advertisers to reach and engage a young adult segment.
