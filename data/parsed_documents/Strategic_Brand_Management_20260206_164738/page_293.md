In the next three chapters, which make up Part IV, we take a detailed look at what consumers know and feel about and act toward brands and how marketers can develop measurement procedures to assess how well their brands are doing.

The customer-based brand equity (CBBE) concept provides guidance about how we can measure brand equity. Given that customer-based brand equity is the differential effect that knowledge about the brand has on customer response to the marketing of that brand, two basic approaches to measuring brand equity present themselves. An *indirect approach* can assess potential sources of customer-based brand equity by identifying and tracking consumers’ brand knowledge—all the thoughts, feelings, images, perceptions, and beliefs linked to the brand. A *direct approach*, on the other hand, can assess the actual impact of brand knowledge on consumer response to different aspects of the marketing program.

The two approaches are complementary, and marketers can and should use both. In other words, for brand equity to provide a useful strategic function and guide marketing decisions, marketers must fully understand the sources of brand equity, how they affect outcomes of interest such as sales, and how these sources and outcomes change, if at all, over time. Chapter 3 provided a framework for conceptualizing consumers’ brand knowledge structures. Chapter 9 uses this information and reviews research methods to measure sources of brand equity and the customer mind-set. Chapter 10 reviews research methods to measure outcomes, that is, the various benefits that may result from creating these sources of brand equity.

Before we get into specifics of measurement, this chapter offers some big-picture perspectives of how to think about brand equity measurement and management. Specifically, we’ll consider how to develop and implement a brand equity measurement system. A *brand equity measurement system* is a set of research procedures designed to provide marketers with timely, accurate, and actionable information about brands so they can make the best possible tactical decisions in the short run and strategic decisions in the long run. The goal is to achieve a full understanding of the sources and outcomes of brand equity and to be able to relate the two as much as possible.

The ideal brand equity measurement system would provide complete, up-to-date, and relevant information about the brand and its competitors to the right decision makers at the right time within the organization. After providing some context about the heightened need for marketing accountability, we’ll look in detail at three steps toward achieving that ideal—conducting brand audits, designing brand tracking studies, and establishing a brand equity management system.

## THE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY

Although senior managers at many firms have embraced the marketing concept and the importance of brands, they often struggle with questions such as: How strong is our brand? How can we ensure that our marketing activities create value? How do we measure that value?

Virtually every marketing dollar spent today must be justified as both effective and efficient in terms of *return of marketing investment* (ROMI).[^1] This increased accountability has forced marketers to address tough challenges and develop new measurement approaches.

Complicating matters is that, depending on the particular industry or category, some observers believe up to 70 percent (or even more) of marketing expenditures may be devoted to programs and activities that improve brand equity but cannot be linked to short-term incremental profits.[^2] Measuring the long-term value of marketing in terms of both its full short-term and long-term impact on consumers is thus crucial for accurately assessing return on investment.

Clearly marketers need new tools and procedures that clarify and justify the value of their expenditures, beyond ROMI measures tied to short-term changes in sales. In Chapter 3, we introduced the brand resonance model and brand value chain, structured means to understand how To learn how consumers think, feel, and act toward brands and products so the company can make informed strategic positioning decisions, marketers should first conduct a brand audit.
