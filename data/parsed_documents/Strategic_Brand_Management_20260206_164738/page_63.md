An English law passed in 1266 required bakers to put their mark on every loaf of bread sold, “to the end that if any bread bu faultie in weight, it may bee then knowne in whom the fault is.” Goldsmiths and silversmiths were also required to mark their goods, both with their signature or personal symbol and with a sign of the quality of the metal. In 1597, two goldsmiths convicted of putting false marks on their wares were nailed to the pillory by their ears. Similarly harsh punishments were decreed for those who counterfeited other artisans’ marks.

When Europeans began to settle in North America, they brought the convention and practice of branding with them. The makers of patent medicines and tobacco manufacturers were early U.S. branding pioneers. Medicine potions such as Swaim’s Panacea, Fahnestock’s Vermifuge, and Perry Davis’ Vegetable Pain Killer became well known to the public prior to the American Civil War. Patent medicines were packaged in small bottles and, because they were not seen as a necessity, were vigorously promoted. To further influence consumer choices in stores, manufacturers of these medicines printed elaborate and distinctive labels, often with their own portrait featured in the center.

Tobacco manufacturers had been exporting their crop since the early 1600s. By the early 1800s, manufacturers had packed bales of tobacco under labels such as Smith’s Plug and Brown and Black’s Twist. During the 1850s, many tobacco manufacturers recognized that more creative names—such as Cantaloupe, Rock Candy, Wedding Cake, and Lone Jack—were helpful in selling their tobacco products. In the 1860s, tobacco manufacturers began to sell their wares in small bags directly to consumers. Attractive-looking packages were seen as important, and picture labels, decorations, and symbols were designed as a result.

## Emergence of National Manufacturer Brands: 1860 to 1914

In the United States after the American Civil War, a number of forces combined to make widely distributed, manufacturer-branded products a profitable venture:

* Improvements in transportation (e.g., railroads) and communication (e.g., telegraph and telephone) made regional and even national distribution increasingly easy.
* Improvements in production processes made it possible to produce large quantities of high-quality products inexpensively.
* Improvements in packaging made individual (as opposed to bulk) packages that could be identified with the manufacturer’s trademark increasingly viable.
* Changes in U.S. trademark law in 1879, the 1880s, and 1906 made it easier to protect brand identities.
* Advertising became perceived as a more credible option, and newspapers and magazines eagerly sought out advertising revenues.
* Retail institutions such as department and variety stores and national mail order houses served as effective middlemen and encouraged consumer spending.
* The population increased due to liberal immigration policies.
* Increasing industrialization and urbanization raised the standard of living and aspirations of Americans, although many products on the market still were of uneven quality.
* Literacy rose as the percentage of illiterate Americans dropped from 20 percent in 1870 to 10 percent in 1900.

All these factors facilitated the development of consistent-quality consumer products that could be efficiently sold to consumers through mass market advertising campaigns. In this fertile branding environment, mass-produced merchandise in packages largely replaced locally produced merchandise sold from bulk containers. This change brought about the widespread use of trademarks. For example, Procter & Gamble made candles in Cincinnati and shipped them to merchants in other cities along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1851, wharf hands began to brand crates of Procter & Gamble candles with a crude star. The firm soon noticed that buyers downriver relied on the star as a mark of quality, and merchants refused the candles if the crates arrived without the mark. As a result, the candles were marked with a more formal star label on all packages, branded as “Star,” and began to develop a loyal following.

The development and management of these brands was largely driven by the owners of the firm and their top-level management. For example, the first president of National Biscuit was involved heavily in the introduction in 1898 of Uneeda Biscuits, the first nationally branded biscuit. One of their first decisions was to create a pictorial symbol for the brand, the Uneeda biscuit slicker boy, who appeared in the supporting ad campaigns. H. J. Heinz built up the Heinz brand name through production innovations and spectacular promotions. Coca-Cola became a national powerhouse due to the efforts of Asa Candler, who actively oversaw the growth of the extensive distribution channel.

National manufacturers sometimes had to overcome resistance from consumers, retailers, wholesalers, and even employees from within their own company. To do so, these firms employed sustained “push” and “pull” efforts to keep both consumers and retailers happy and accepting of national brands. Consumers were attracted through the use of sampling, premiums, product education brochures, and heavy advertising. Retailers were lured by in-store sampling and promotional programs and shelf maintenance assistance.

As the use of brand names and trademarks spread, so did the practice of imitation and counterfeiting. Although the laws were somewhat unclear, more and more firms sought protection by sending their trademarks and labels to district courts for registration. Congress finally separated the registration of trademarks and labels in 1870 with the enactment of the country’s first federal trademark law. Under the law, registrants were required to send a facsimile of their mark with a description of the type of goods on which it was used to the Patent Office in Washington along with a $25 fee. One of the first marks submitted to the Patent Office under the new law was the Underwood Devil, which was registered to William Underwood & Company of Boston on November 29, 1870 for use on “Deviled Entremets.” By 1890, most countries had trademark acts, establishing brand names, labels, and designs as legally protectable assets.

## Dominance of Mass Marketed Brands: 1915 to 1929

By 1915, manufacturer brands had become well established in the United States on both a regional and national basis. The next 15 years saw increasing acceptance and even admiration of manufacturer brands by consumers. The marketing of brands became more specialized under the guidance of functional experts in charge of production, promotion, personal selling, and other areas. This greater specialization led to more advanced marketing techniques. Design professionals were enlisted to assist in the process of trademark selection. Personal selling became more sophisticated as salesmen were carefully selected.
