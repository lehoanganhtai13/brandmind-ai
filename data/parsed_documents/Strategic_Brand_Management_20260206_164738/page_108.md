We next broaden our discussion to consider the two other interlinking models, which all together make up the brand planning system.

We first present the *brand resonance model*, which describes how to create intense, active loyalty relationships with customers. The model considers how brand positioning affects what consumers think, feel, and do and the degree to which they resonate or connect with a brand. After discussing some of the main implications of that model, we consider how brand resonance and these loyalty relationships, in turn, create brand equity or value.

The *brand value chain model* is a means by which marketers can trace the value creation process for their brands to better understand the financial impact of their marketing expenditures and investments. Based in part on the customer-based brand equity (CBBE) concept developed in Chapter 2, it offers a holistic, integrated approach to understanding how brands create value.

Brand Focus 3.0 at the end of the chapter provides a detailed overview of the topic of customer equity.

## BUILDING A STRONG BRAND: THE FOUR STEPS OF BRAND BUILDING

The brand resonance model looks at building a brand as a sequence of steps, each of which is contingent on successfully achieving the objectives of the previous one. The steps are as follows:

1. Ensure identification of the brand with customers and an association of the brand in customers’ minds with a specific product class, product benefit, or customer need.  
2. Firmly establish the totality of brand meaning in the minds of customers by strategically linking a host of tangible and intangible brand associations.  
3. Elicit the proper customer responses to the brand.  
4. Convert brand responses to create brand resonance and an intense, active loyalty relationship between customers and the brand.

These four steps represent a set of fundamental questions that customers invariably ask about brands—at least implicitly. The four questions (with corresponding brand steps in parentheses) are:

1. Who are you? (brand identity)  
2. What are you? (brand meaning)  
3. What about you? What do I think or feel about you? (brand responses)  
4. What about you and me? What kind of association and how much of a connection would I like to have with you? (brand relationships)

Notice the ordering of the steps in this *branding ladder*, from identity to meaning to responses to relationships. That is, we cannot establish meaning unless we have created identity; responses cannot occur unless we have developed the right meaning; and we cannot forge a relationship unless we have elicited the proper responses.

To provide some structure, let us think of establishing six *brand building blocks* with customers that we can assemble in a pyramid, with significant brand equity only resulting if brands reach the top of the pyramid. This brand-building process is illustrated in Figures 3-1 and 3-2. We’ll look at each of these steps and corresponding brand building blocks and their subdimensions in the following sections. As will become apparent, building blocks up the left side of the pyramid represent a more “rational route” to brand building, whereas building blocks up the right side of the pyramid represent a more “emotional route.” Most strong brands are built by going up both sides of the pyramid.

### Brand Salience

Achieving the right brand identity means creating brand salience with customers. **Brand salience** measures various aspects of the awareness of the brand and how easily and often the brand is evoked under various situations or circumstances. To what extent is the brand top-of-mind and easily ----
