Peppers and Rogers also provide an example of a localized version of one-to-one marketing. After having ordered flowers at a local florist for his or her mother, a customer might receive a postcard “reminding him that he had sent roses and star lilies last year and that a phone call would put a beautiful arrangement on her doorstep again for her birthday this year.” Although such online or offline reminders can be helpful, marketers must not assume that customers always want to repeat their behaviors. For example, what if the flowers were a doomed, last-chance attempt to salvage a failing relationship? Then a reminder under such circumstances may not be exactly welcome!

An example of a highly successful relationship marketing program comes from Tesco, the United Kingdom’s largest grocer.

## TESCO

Celebrating its fifteenth anniversary in 2010, Tesco Clubcard is one of the world’s most successful retail loyalty schemes. Each of the 10 million members in the program has a unique “DNA profile” based on the products he or she buys. Products themselves are classified on up to 40 dimensions—such as package size, healthy, own label, ecofriendly, ready-to-eat, and so on—to facilitate this customer categorization. In exchange for providing their purchase information and basic demographic information, members receive a variety of purchase benefits across a wide range of products and services beyond what is sold in their stores. Tracking customers’ purchases in the program, in turn, helps Tesco uncover price elasticities, offer targeted promotions, and improve marketing efficiency. By also strengthening customer loyalty, the Clubcard program has been estimated to generate cumulative savings to Tesco of over £350 million. The range of products, the nature of merchandising, and even the location of Tesco’s convenience stores all benefit from the use of this customer data to develop tailored solutions. Tesco has introduced a number of Clubcard program innovations through the years, including key fobs and newly designed cards issued in 2008.<sup>20</sup>

**Permission Marketing.** _Permission marketing_, the practice of marketing to consumers only after gaining their express permission, was another influential perspective on how companies can break through the clutter and build customer loyalty. A pioneer on the topic, Seth Godin, has noted that marketers can no longer employ “interruption marketing” or mass media campaigns featuring magazines, direct mail, billboards, radio and television commercials, and the like, because consumers have come to expect—but not necessarily appreciate—these interruptions.<sup>21</sup> By contrast, Godin asserts, consumers appreciate receiving marketing messages they gave permission for: “The worse the clutter gets, the more profitable your permission marketing efforts become.” Given the large number of marketing communications that bombard consumers every day, Godin argues that if marketers want to attract a consumer’s attention, they first need to get his or her permission with some kind of inducement—a free sample, a sales promotion or discount, a contest, and so on.
