# Rolex Product Portfolio

This table outlines Rolex watch collections, categorizing them into three main lines: Oyster Perpetual, Oyster Professional, and Cellini. The Oyster Perpetual collection encompasses a range of classic and elegant timepieces, including models like the Datejust, Day-Date, and Lady-Datejust variations. The Oyster Professional line features robust and specialized watches designed for demanding activities, such as the Explorer, Submariner, GMT-Master II, and Cosmograph Daytona. Finally, the Cellini collection presents a more refined and dressy aesthetic, with models like the Cellinium, Classic, and Prince. This structure highlights a clear division based on intended use and design philosophy across Rolex's diverse offerings.

Affiliate with conglomerates in order to compete, but by staying an independent entity, Rolex has remained focused on its core business. André Heiniger, managing chairman of Rolex through the 1980s, explained, “Rolex’s strategy is oriented to marketing, maintaining quality, and staying out of fields where we are not prepared to compete effectively.”

## Brand Portfolio

Rolex includes three family brands of wristwatches, called “collections”; each has a subset of brands (see Figure 8-7).

* The *Oyster Perpetual Collection* includes the “traditional” Rolex wristwatch, and has eight sub-brands that are differentiated by features and design. The Perpetual Collection targets affluent men and women.
* The *Professional Collection* targets specific athletic and adventurer user groups through its features and imagery. The Oyster Professional Collection includes seven sub-brands.
* The *Cellini Collection* focuses on formal occasions through its elegant designs, and encompasses seven sub-brands. These watches incorporate fashion and style features like colored leather bands and an extensive use of diamonds.

In addition to the three collections, Rolex owns a separate “fighter” brand called Tudor, developed in 1946 to stave off competition from mid-range watches such as Tag Heuer, Citizen, and Rado. Tudor has its own range of family brands, or collections, namely Prince, Princess, Monarch, and Sport, each of which encompasses a number of sub-brands. Tudor watches are sold at own-brand specialty stores and through the network of exclusive Rolex dealers. Although they are no longer for sale in the United States, there are many outlets in Europe and Asia. Tudor targets younger consumers and offers watches at a lower price range. The brand is distinctly separate, and the Rolex name does not appear on Tudor watches.

## BRAND INVENTORY

Rolex’s success as the largest single luxury watch brand can be credited to several factors. The company not only produces extremely high-quality timepieces, but also tightly controls how its watches are sold, ensuring high demand and premium prices. In addition, Rolex’s sophisticated marketing strategy has created an exclusive and premium brand that many aspire to own. The brand inventory will describe each of these factors in more depth.

## Brand Elements

Rolex’s most distinguishable brand element is its Crown logo. Trademarked in 1925, the Crown made its appearance on the watches in 1939. The logo has undergone few revisions, keeping its signature five-point crown intact over the years. Rolex watches feature the name “Rolex” on the dial, a tradition dating to 1926. This development initially helped increase brand recognition. Many Rolex watches also have a distinct look, including a big round face and wide wrist band.
