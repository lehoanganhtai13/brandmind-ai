This chapter considers the final and perhaps most flexible element of marketing programs. *Marketing communications* are the means by which firms attempt to inform, persuade, and remind consumers—directly or indirectly—about the brands they sell. In a sense, marketing communications represent the voice of the brand and are a means by which the brand can establish a dialogue and build relationships with consumers. Although advertising is often a central element of a marketing communications program, it is usually not the only element—or even the most important one—for building brand equity. Figure 6-1 displays some of the common marketing communication options for the consumer market.

Designing marketing communication programs is a complex task. We begin by describing the rapidly changing media landscape and the new realities in marketing communications. To provide necessary background, we next evaluate how the major communication options contribute to brand equity and some of their main costs and benefits. We conclude by considering how to mix and match communication options—that is, how to employ a range of communication options in a coordinated or integrated fashion—to build brand equity. We consider some of what we have learned about advertising in Brand Focus 6.0. For the sake of brevity, we will not consider specific marketing communication issues such as media scheduling, budget estimation techniques, and research approaches or the topic of personal selling.¹

This table outlines a hierarchical structure of marketing communications, broadly categorized into Media advertising, Consumer promotions, and Trade promotions. Media advertising encompasses traditional channels like TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines, alongside direct response methods (mail, telephone) and place advertising (billboards, point-of-purchase displays). Consumer promotions are further divided into direct incentives (samples, coupons, price-offs) and interactive digital strategies (websites, e-mails, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and video content). Trade promotions target intermediaries with tools such as trade deals, allowances, push money, and training programs. The structure also highlights the growing importance of digital and interactive elements within consumer promotions, including mobile marketing and online advertising formats. Additionally, it acknowledges other key promotional tools like publicity, public relations, word-of-mouth, and personal selling. Although advertising and other communication options can play different roles in the marketing program, one important purpose they all serve is to contribute to brand equity.
