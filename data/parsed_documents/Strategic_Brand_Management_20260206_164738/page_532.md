This guideline suggests the need for patience, and the possibility of backtracking on brand development, to engage in a set of marketing programs and activities that the brand has long since moved beyond in its original markets. Marketers sometimes fail to realize that in their own country, they are building on a foundation of perhaps decades of carefully compiled associations in customers’ minds. Although the period needed to build the brand in new markets may be compressed, it will still take some time.

The temptation—and often the mistake—is to export the current marketing program because it seems to work. Although that may be the case, the fact that a marketing program can meet with acceptance or even some success doesn’t mean it is the best way to build strong, sustainable global brand equity. An important key to success is to understand each consumer, recognize what he or she knows or could value about the brand, and tailor marketing programs to his or her desires.

Observing that many large companies simply diluted formulas to make less expensive products, Hindustan Lever, an Indian subsidiary of Unilever, made a substantial commitment to R&D and innovation to better serve the Indian market. These efforts resulted in completely new products that were both affordable and uniquely suited to India’s rural poor, including a high-quality combination soap and shampoo, and that were backed by successful new sales and marketing tactics specifically developed to reach remote and highly dispersed populations. Hindustan Lever trained 50,000 to go door-to-door in India to educate consumers there and sell soap, toothpaste, and other products.<sup>54</sup>

### 3. Establish Marketing Infrastructure

A critical success factor for many global brands is their manufacturing, distribution, and logistical advantages. These brands have created the appropriate marketing infrastructure, from scratch if necessary, and adapted to capitalize on the existing marketing infrastructure in other countries. We noted above that channels especially vary in their stages of development. Chain grocers have a 50 percent share in China, 40 percent in Russia, but only 15 percent in India.<sup>55</sup> Concerned about poor refrigeration in European stores, Häagen-Dazs ended up supplying thousands of free freezers to retailers across the continent.<sup>56</sup>

Companies go to great lengths to ensure consistency in product quality across markets. McDonald’s gets over 90 percent of its raw materials from local suppliers and will even expend resources to create the necessary inputs if they are not locally available. Hence, investing to improve potato farms in Russia is standard practice because French fries are one of McDonald’s core products and a key source of brand equity. More often, however, companies have to adapt production and distribution operations, invest in foreign partners, or both in order to succeed.
