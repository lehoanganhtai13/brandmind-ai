# Product

In particular, the firm has maintained a keen focus on delivering a highly accurate watch of superior craftsmanship, using only the finest premium materials such as gold, platinum, and jewels. It continually works on improving the functionality of its watches with better movements and new, sophisticated features. As a result, Rolex watches are complex mechanisms compared to most mass-produced watches. A quartz watch, for example, has between 50 and 100 parts; a Rolex Oyster chronometer has 220.<sup>31</sup>

Each Rolex watch consists of 10 unique features identified as the company’s “10 Golden Rules:”

1. A waterproof case  
2. The Perpetual rotor  
3. The case back  
4. The Oyster case  
5. The winding crown  
6. The finest and purest materials  
7. Quality control  
8. Rolex self-winding movement  
9. Testing from the independent Controle Official Suisse des Chronometres  
10. Rolex testing  

The company does not license its brand or produce any other product besides watches. Its product portfolio is clear, concise, and focused.

Rolex spends more time and money than any other watch company fighting counterfeiters. Today, it is often hard to spot the differences between a $25 counterfeit and a $10,000 authentic Rolex watch. Counterfeiting Rolex watches has become a sophisticated industry, with sales exceeding $1.8 billion per year.

# Pricing

By limiting production to approximately 2,000 watches a day, Rolex keeps consumer demand high and prices at a premium. Prices start around $2,500 for the basic Oyster Perpetual and can reach $200,000, depending on the specific materials used such as steel, yellow gold, or platinum. Scarcity also helps positively influence the resale value of Rolex watches. One report indicated that “almost all older Rolex models are valued above their initial selling price.”<sup>32</sup>

# Distribution

Rolex carefully monitors how its timepieces are sold, distributing them only through its approximately 60,000 “Official Rolex Dealers” worldwide. Official dealers must meet several criteria, including a high-end image, adequate space, attractive location, and outstanding service. In addition, a large secondary market exists for Rolex, both through online auction sites such as eBay and at live auctions run by Christies and Sotheby’s.

# Communications

Rolex’s marketing and communications strategy strives to create a high-quality, exclusive brand image. The company associates itself with “ambassadors”—established artists, top athletes, rugged adventurers, and daring explorers—to help create this imagery. Rolex also sponsors various sports and cultural events as well as philanthropy programs to help align with targeted demographics as well as create positive associations in consumers’ minds.

**Advertising.**  
Rolex is the number-one watch advertiser in the world. In 2008, the firm spent over $49 million on advertising, $20 million more than the number-two contender, Breitling.<sup>33</sup> One of the company’s largest expenditures is for magazine advertising. Rolex’s print ads are often simple and austere, usually featuring one of its many brand ambassadors or a close-up photo of one of its watches with the tagline “Rolex. A Crown for Every Achievement.” Rolex does not advertise extensively on television, but does sponsor some events that are televised.

**Ambassadors.**  
Rolex’s celebrity endorsers are continuously added and dropped depending on their performance. These ambassadors fall into four categories: athletes, artists, explorers,

Rolex sponsors a number of different sporting events, including sailing races.
