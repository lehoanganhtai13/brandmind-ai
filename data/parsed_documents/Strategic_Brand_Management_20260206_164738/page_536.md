* Retailers that sell to upper-class individuals or that specialize in a salient but unfulfilled need: By offering a wide variety of toys at affordable prices, Toys’R’Us transformed the European toy market, getting Europeans to buy toys for children at any time of the year, not just Christmas, and forcing competitors to level prices across countries.⁶⁷  
* Brands positioned primarily on the basis of their country of origin: An example is Australia’s Foster’s beer, which ran the “How to Speak Australian” ad campaign for years in the United States.  
* Products that do not need customization or other special products to be able to function properly: ITT Corporation found that stand-alone products such as heart pacemakers could easily be sold the same way worldwide, but that integrated products such as telecommunications equipment have to be tailored to function within local phone systems.⁶⁸  

## 7. Balance Global and Local Control

Building brand equity in a global context must be a carefully designed and implemented process. A key decision in developing a global marketing program is choosing the most appropriate organizational structure for managing global brands. In general, there are three main approaches to organizing for a global marketing effort:

1. Centralization at home office or headquarters  
2. Decentralization of decision making to local foreign markets  
3. Some combination of centralization and decentralization  

In general, firms tend to adopt a combination of centralization and decentralization to better balance local adaptation and global standardization.⁶⁹ Some firms such as GE, Intel, and AstraZeneca have adopted a T-shaped country organization that localizes customer-facing operations to allow for fast, detailed marketing actions while at the same distributing back-end activities (manufacturing, product development, R&D) across countries.⁷⁰  

In many, if not most, markets, the cost savings of standardization may not outweigh the revenue potential from tailoring programs to different groups of consumers.⁷¹ Each aspect of the marketing program is a candidate for globalization. Which elements of the marketing program should we standardize, and to what degree?⁷² Cost and revenue should be the primary considerations in deciding which elements of the marketing program will be adapted for which country.  

Riesenbeck and Freeling advocate a mixed strategy, standardizing the “core aspects” of the brand (those that provide its main competitive edge) but allowing local adaptation of “secondary aspects.” According to their approach, branding, positioning, and product formulation are more likely to be standardized, and advertising and pricing less so; distribution is most often localized.⁷³  

Many global companies divide their markets into five or so regions, for example, Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, and Africa/Middle East. A key theme is the need to balance global and local control. Coca-Cola, for example, distinguishes between local marketing activities that would appear to dilute brand equity and those that are not as effective as desired. Headquarters would stop the first from occurring but would not stop the latter, leaving the activity’s appropriateness to the local manager’s judgment but also holding him or her responsible for its success. Similarly, Levi Strauss has balanced global and local control with a “thermometer” model. Marketing elements below the “freezing point” are fixed: “brand soul” (akin to brand essence or mantra) and logos are standardized worldwide. Above the freezing point, product quality, pricing, advertising, distribution, and promotions are all fluid, meaning each international division can handle the marketing mix elements in any way that it feels is appropriate for its region.  

Firms often centralize advertising, consolidating their worldwide ad accounts and shifting most or all of their advertising billings to agencies with extensive global networks, to reduce costs and increase efficiency and control. Nevertheless, Braun’s and Levi Strauss’s regional managers have been able to bar a global campaign from their area. Unilever’s regional managers who seek to substitute their own campaigns must produce research showing that the global plan is inappropriate. Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble have taken the middle ground, developing a global communications program but testing and fine-tuning it in meetings with regional managers.⁷⁴ Brand definitions and guidelines must be established, communicated, and properly enforced so marketers in different regions have a good understanding of what they are and are not expected to do.
