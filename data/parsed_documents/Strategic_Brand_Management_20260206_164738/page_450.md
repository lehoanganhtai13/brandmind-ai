# Creating Extension Equity

For the brand extension to create equity, it must have a sufficiently high level of awareness and achieve necessary and desired points-of-parity and points-of-difference. Brand awareness will depend primarily on the marketing program and resources devoted to spreading the word about the extension. As Chapter 11 described, it will also obviously depend on the type of branding strategy adopted: The more prominently we use an existing brand that has already achieved a certain level of awareness and image to brand an extension, the easier it should be to create awareness of and an image for the extension in memory.

Initially, whether we can create a positive image for an extension will depend on three consumer-related factors:

1. How *salient* parent brand associations are in the minds of consumers in the extension context; that is, what information comes to mind about the parent brand when consumers think of the proposed extension, and the strength of those associations.  
2. How *favorable* any inferred associations are in the extension context; that is, whether this information suggests the type of product or service the brand extension would be, and whether consumers view these associations as good or bad in the extension context.  
3. How *unique* any inferred associations are in the extension category; that is, how these perceptions compare with those about competitors.

As with any brand, successful brand extensions must achieve desired points-of-parity and points-of-difference. Without powerful points-of-difference, the brand risks becoming an undistinguished “me-too” entry, vulnerable to well-positioned competitors. Tauber refers to “competitive leverage” as the set of advantages that a brand conveys to an extended product in the new category, that is, “when the consumer, by simply knowing the brand, can think of important ways that they perceive that the new brand extension would be better than competing brands in the category.” This appeared to be the case with the UK launch of the Dettol Easy Mop disposable mop system, an extension of Reckitt-Benckiser’s Dettol household cleaner brand, which leveraged the familiar Dettol brand in outselling other entrants into the category.

At the same time, marketers must also establish any required points-of-parity. The more dissimilar the extension product is to the parent brand, the more likely that points-of-parity will become a positioning priority, and the more important it is to make sure that category POPs are sufficiently well established. Consumers might have a clear understanding of the extension’s
