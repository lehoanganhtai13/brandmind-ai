The one-time “champagne of bottled beer,” Miller High Life, was relegated to a discount brand in the 1990s to protect premium-priced Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite. Similarly, P&G repositioned its one-time top-tier Luvs diaper brand to serve as a price fighter against private labels and store brands to protect the premium Pampers brand.  

In designing fighter brands, marketers walk a fine line. Fighters must not be so attractive that they take sales away from their higher-priced comparison brands or referents. At the same time, if they are connected to other brands in the portfolio in any way (say, through a common branding strategy), they must not be designed so cheaply that they reflect poorly on these other brands.  

**Cash Cows.** Some brands may be kept around despite dwindling sales because they still manage to hold on to a sufficient number of customers and maintain their profitability with virtually no marketing support. Marketers can effectively milk these “cash cows” by capitalizing on their reservoir of existing brand equity. For example, while technological advances have moved much of the market to its newer Fusion brand of razors, Gillette still sells its older Trac II, Atra, Sensor, and Mach3 brands. Because withdrawing these may not necessarily switch customers to another Gillette brand, the company may profit more by keeping than discarding them.  

**Low-End, Entry-Level or High-End, Prestige Brands.** Many brands introduce line extensions or brand variants in a certain product category that vary in price and quality. These subbrands leverage associations from other brands while distinguishing themselves on price and quality. In this case, the end points of the brand line often play a specialized role.  

The role of a relatively low-priced brand in the brand portfolio often may be to attract customers to the brand franchise. Retailers like to feature these traffic builders because they often are able to “trade up” customers to a higher-priced brand. For example, Verizon wireless plans allow customers to upgrade their old, sometimes cheaper cell phones to newer versions that are more expensive but still cheaper than retail.
