district court ruled that Bayer had lost all its rights in the trademark. Other brand names have struggled to retain their legal trademark status, for example, Band-Aids, Kleenex, Scotch Tape, Q-Tips, and Jello. Xerox spends $100,000 a year explaining that you don’t “Xerox” a document, you photocopy it.  
Legally, the courts have created a hierarchy for determining eligibility for registration. In descending order of protection, these categories are as follows (with concepts and examples in parentheses):

1. Fanciful (made-up word with no inherent meaning, e.g., Kodak)  
2. Arbitrary (actual word but not associated with product, e.g., Camel)  
3. Suggestive (actual word evocative of product feature or benefit, e.g., Eveready)  
4. Descriptive (common word protected only with secondary meaning, e.g., Ivory)  
5. Generic (word synonymous with the product category, e.g., Aspirin)  

Thus, fanciful names are the most easily protected, but at the same time are less suggestive or descriptive of the product itself, suggesting the type of trade-off involved in choosing brand elements. Generic terms are never protectable. Marks that are difficult to protect include those that are surnames, descriptive terms, or geographic names or those that relate to a functional product feature. Marks that are not inherently distinctive and thus are not immediately protectable may attain trademark protection if they acquire secondary meaning.  

**Secondary meaning** refers to a mark gaining a meaning other than the older (primary) meaning. The secondary meaning must be the meaning the public usually attaches to the mark and that indicates the association between the mark and goods from a single source. Secondary meaning is usually proven through extensive advertising, distribution, availability, sales volume, length and manner of use, and market share. Secondary meaning is necessary to establish trademark protection for descriptive marks, geographic terms, and personal names.

### Trademark Issues Concerning Packaging

In general, names and graphic designs are more legally defensible than shapes and colors. The issue of legal protection of the color of packaging for a brand is a complicated one. One federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that companies cannot get trademark protection for a product’s color alone. The court ruled against a small Chicago manufacturer that makes green-gold padding used by dry cleaners and garment makers on machines that press clothes; the manufacturer had filed suit against a competitor that had started selling padding of the same hue. In rejecting protection for the color alone, the court said manufacturers with distinctively colored products can rely on existing law that protects “trade dress” related to the overall appearance of the product:  
> “Adequate protection is available when color is combined in distinctive patterns or designs or combined in distinctive logos.”  

Color is one factor, but not a determinative one, under a trade dress analysis. This ruling differed from a landmark ruling in 1985 arising from a suit by Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, which sought to protect the pink color of its insulation. A Washington court ruled in the corporation’s favor. Other courts have made similar rulings, but at least two other appeals courts in other regions of the country have subsequently ruled that colors cannot be trademarked. Note that these trademark rulings apply only when color is not an integral part of the product. However, given the lack of uniform trademark protection across the United States, companies planning a national campaign may have to rely on the harder-to-prove trade dress arguments.
