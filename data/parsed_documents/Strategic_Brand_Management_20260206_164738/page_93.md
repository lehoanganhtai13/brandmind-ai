1. Physiological needs (food, water, air, shelter, sex)  
2. Safety and security needs (protection, order, stability)  
3. Social needs (affection, friendship, belonging)  
4. Ego needs (prestige, status, self-respect)  
5. Self-actualization (self-fulfillment)  

According to Maslow, higher-level needs become relevant once lower-level needs have been satisfied.

Marketers have also recognized the importance of higher-level needs. For example, *means-end chains* have been devised as a way of understanding higher-level meanings of brand characteristics. A means-end chain takes the following structure: attributes (descriptive features that characterize a product) lead to benefits (the personal value and meaning attached to product attributes), which, in turn, lead to values (stable and enduring personal goals or motivations).<sup>55</sup>

In other words, a consumer chooses a product that delivers an attribute (A) that provides benefits or has certain consequences (B/C) that satisfy values (V). For example, in a study of salty snacks, one respondent noted that a flavored chip (A) with a strong taste (A) would mean that she would eat less (B/C), not get fat (B/C), and have a better figure (B/C), all of which would enhance her self-esteem (V).

Laddering thus progresses from attributes to benefits to more abstract values or motivations. In effect, laddering repeatedly asks what the implication of an attribute or benefit is for the consumer. Failure to move up the ladder may reduce the strategic alternatives available to a brand.<sup>56</sup> For example, P&G introduced low-sudsing Dash detergent to attract consumers who used front-loading washing machines. Many years of advertising Dash in this manner made this position impenetrable by other brands. Dash was so associated with front-loaders, however, that when this type of machine went out of fashion, so did Dash, despite the fact that it was among P&G’s most effective detergents, and despite significant efforts to reposition the brand.

Some attributes and benefits may lend themselves to laddering more easily than others. For example, the Betty Crocker brand appears on a number of different baking products and is characterized by the physical warmth associated with baking. Such an association makes it relatively easy to talk about emotional warmth and the joy of baking or the good feelings that might arise from baking for others across a wide range of baking-related products.

Thus, some of the strongest brands deepen their points-of-difference to create benefit and value associations, for example, Volvo and Michelin (safety and peace of mind), Intel (performance and compatibility), Marlboro (western imagery), Coke (Americana and refreshment), Disney (fun, magic, family entertainment), Nike (innovative products and peak athletic performance), and BMW (styling and driving performance).

As a brand becomes associated with more and more products and moves up the product hierarchy, the brand’s meaning will become more abstract. At the same time, it is important that the proper category membership and POPs and PODs exist in the minds of consumers for any particular products sold under the brand name, as discussed in Chapter 11.

**Reacting.** Competitive actions are often directed at eliminating points-of-difference to make them points-of-parity or to strengthen or establish new points-of-difference. Often competitive advantages exist for only a short period of time before competitors attempt to match them. For example, when Goodyear introduced RunOnFlat tires (which allowed tires to keep going for up to 50 miles at a speed of 55 mph after a tire puncture or blowout), Michelin quickly responded with the Zero Pressure tire, which offered the same consumer benefit.

When a competitor challenges an existing POD or attempts to overcome a POP, there are essentially three main options for the target brand—from no reaction to moderate to significant reactions.

* Do nothing. If the competitive actions seem unlikely to recapture a POD or create a new POD, then the best reaction is probably to just stay the course and continue brand-building efforts.  
* Go on the defensive. If the competitive actions appear to have the potential to disrupt the market some, then it may be necessary to take a defensive stance. One way to defend the positioning is to add some reassurance in the product or advertising to strengthen POPs and PODs.  
* Go on the offensive. If the competitive actions seem potentially quite damaging, then it might be necessary to take a more aggressive stance and reposition the brand to address the threat. One approach might be to launch a product extension or ad campaign that fundamentally changes the meaning of the brand.
