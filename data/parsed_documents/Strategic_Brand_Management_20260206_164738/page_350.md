# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 9-2

## Understanding Brand Engagement

*Actual brand engagement* is the activities with which the consumer currently is engaged with the brand and is typically what is measured with the brand resonance model. Two other approaches provide interesting contrasts. *Ideal brand engagement* is the activities the brand consumer wishes they could do with the brand. *Market brand engagement* is the activities the consumer believes other consumers are doing with the brand.

Market brand engagement will be closely related to measures of *brand momentum*—how much progress the brand appears to be making with consumers in the marketplace. Both sets of measures deal with consumer perceptions of how other consumers are connecting to a brand.

Measures of actual brand engagement can take two forms—more general, macro measures or more specific, micro measures. Macro measures focus on the types of resources expended, for example:

* Time: “It is worth spending more time on the brand (or going out of the way for it).”
* Energy: “It is worth investing extra effort on the brand.”
* Money: “It is worth spending more money on the brand.”

Micro sets of measures focus on specific categories of brand-related activities. These activities fall into three categories depending on whether they relate to: (1) collecting brand information, (2) participating in brand marketing activities, or (3) interacting with other people and having a sense of community. Here are some possible questions.

### Collecting Brand Information

* If this brand has any new products or services, I tend to notice it.  
* If I see a newspaper or magazine article about this brand, I tend to read it.  
* If I hear a TV or radio story about this brand, I tend to listen to it.  
* If I see a news story online about this brand, I tend to open and read it.  
* I like to visit this brand’s Web site.  
* I like to read online blogs about this brand.  

### Participating in Brand Marketing Activities

* If I notice an ad for this brand, I tend to pay attention to it.  
* If I notice a sales promotion from this brand, I tend to pay attention to it.  
* If I get something in the mail from this brand, I tend to open it.  
* If this brand sponsors a sports, entertainment or arts event, I tend to notice it.  
* If I see a billboard or any outdoor type ad for this brand, I tend to notice it.  
* If this brand has a display or demonstration in the store, I tend to notice it.  
* If this brand shows up in a movie or television show, I tend to notice it.  
* If I get a chance to sample one of this brand’s new products, I tend to try it.  
* I like to buy licensed products from this brand.  

### Interacting with Other People

* I like to talk to others about this brand.  
* I like to talk to people at work about this brand.  
* I like to talk to my friends and family about this brand.

These are only some representative examples of the types of survey measures that could be employed to assess brand engagement. Depending on the category and circumstances, a variety of other questions could be devised and fruitfully applied.

> view, which identifies general personality tendencies that might or might not be connected to marketing strategies and goals.  
> Fournier has conducted fascinating research that reframes the conceptualization and measurement of brand strength strictly in relationship terms. It defines a brand’s strength in terms of the strength, depth, and durability of the consumer-brand relational bond using the multifaceted concept of *brand relationship quality*, or **BRQ**. Extensive validation work supported a multifaceted hierarchical structure for the BRQ construct that includes six main dimensions of relationship strength, many with important subfacets. The main facets are (1) interdependence, (2) self-concept connection, (3) commitment, (4) love/passion, (5) intimacy, and (6) brand partner quality.
