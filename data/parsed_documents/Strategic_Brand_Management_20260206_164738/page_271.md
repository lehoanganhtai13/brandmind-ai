# Understanding Retailers’ Brand Images

Like the brands they sell, retailers have brand images that influence consumers and must be carefully constructed and maintained. Academics have identified the following five dimensions of a retailer’s brand image:

## Access  
The location of a store and the distance that consumers must travel to shop are basic criteria in their store choice decisions. Access is a key component in consumers’ assessment of total shopping costs, and is especially important for retailers who wish to get a substantial share of wallet from fill-in trips and small-basket shoppers.

## Store Atmosphere  
Different elements of a retailer’s in-store environment, like color, music, and crowding, can influence consumers’ perceptions of its atmosphere, whether or not they visit a store, how much time they spend in it, and how much money they spend there. A pleasing in-store atmosphere provides substantial hedonic utility to consumers and encourages them to visit more often, stay longer, and buy more. Although it improves consumers’ perceptions of the quality of merchandise in the store, consumers also tend to associate it with higher prices. An appealing in-store atmosphere also offers much potential in terms of crafting a unique store image and establishing differentiation. Even if the products and brands stocked by a retailer are similar to those sold by others, the ability to create a strong in-store personality and rich experiences can play a crucial role in building retailer brand equity.

## Price and Promotion  
A retailer’s price image is influenced by attributes like average level of prices, how much variation there is in prices over time, the frequency and depth of promotions, and whether the retailer positions itself on a continuum between EDLP (everyday low price) and HILO (high-low promotional) pricing. Consumers are more likely to develop a favorable price image when retailers offer frequent discounts on a large number of products than when they offer less frequent, but steeper discounts. Further, products that have high unit price and are purchased more frequently are more salient in determining the retailer’s price image. One pricing format does not dominate another, but research has shown that large-basket shoppers prefer EDLP stores while small-basket shoppers prefer HILO, and it is optimal for HILO stores to charge an average price that is higher than the EDLP. Finally, price promotions are associated with store switching, but the effect is indirect, altering consumers’ category purchase decisions while they are in the store rather than their choice of which store to visit.

## Cross-Category Assortment  
Consumers’ perception of the breadth of different products and services offered by a retailer under one roof significantly influences store image. A broad assortment can create customer value by offering convenience and ease of shopping. It is risky to extend too far too soon, but staying too tightly coupled to the current assortment and image may unnecessarily limit the retailer’s range of experimentation. The logic and sequencing of a retailer’s assortment policy are critical to its ability to successfully expand its meaning and appeal to consumers over time.

## Within-Category Assortment  
Consumers’ perceptions of the depth of a retailer’s assortment within a product category are an important dimension of store image and a key driver of store choice. As the perceived assortment of brands, flavors, and sizes increases, variety-seeking consumers will perceive greater utility, consumers with uncertain future preferences will believe they have more flexibility in their choices, and, in general, consumers are more likely to find the item they desire. A greater number of SKUs need not directly translate to better perceptions. Retailers often can reduce the number of SKUs substantially without adversely affecting consumer perceptions, as long as they pay attention to the most preferred brands, the organization of the assortment, and the availability of diverse product attributes.

Figure 7-4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of co-branding and licensing. The main advantage of co-branding is that a product may be uniquely and convincingly positioned by virtue of the multiple brands in the campaign. Co-branding can create more compelling points-of-difference or points-of-parity for the brand—or both—than otherwise might have been feasible. As a result, it can generate greater sales from the existing target market as well as open additional opportunities with new consumers and channels. When Kraft adds Dole fruit to its popular Lunchables lunch combinations line for kids, it was partly to help address health concerns and criticism from nutrition critics.<sup>19</sup> **Advantages**
