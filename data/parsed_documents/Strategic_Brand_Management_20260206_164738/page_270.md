Another challenge with country-of-origin is how consumers actually define it and under what circumstances they care. Many U.S. companies are moving their manufacturing offshore. Although they may still base their headquarters on U.S. soil, some very iconic brands—including Converse, Levi’s, Mattel, and Rawlings baseballs—are no longer manufactured in the United States. Some other famous U.S. brands, such as Ben & Jerry’s, Budweiser, and Gerber, are actually owned by foreign corporations.

In an increasingly globally connected world, the concept of country-of-origin is likely to become very confusing at times. Governments in some countries have even taken steps to protect their popular industries. Swiss lawmakers have stipulated that local watchmakers can label their products Swiss-made only if non-Swiss parts equal less than 50 percent of the value of the watch’s movement, or motor.¹⁴

## CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION

Chapter 5 described how members of the channels of distribution can directly affect the equity of the brands they sell. Let’s next consider how retail stores can indirectly affect brand equity through an “image transfer” process because of consumers’ associations linked to the retail stores.

Because of associations to product assortment, pricing and credit policy, quality of service, and so on, retailers have their own brand images in consumers’ minds. The Science of Branding 7-1 summarizes academic research into the dimensions of retailer images. Retailers create these associations through the products and brands they stock and the means by which they sell them. To more directly shape their images, many retailers aggressively advertise and promote directly to customers.

A consumer may infer certain characteristics about a brand on the basis of where it is sold. “If it’s sold by Nordstrom, it must be good quality.” Consumers may perceive the same brand differently depending on whether it is sold in a store seen as prestigious and exclusive, or in a store designed for bargain shoppers and having more mass appeal.

The transfer of store image associations can be either positive or negative for a brand. For many high-end brands, a natural growth strategy is to expand the customer base by tapping new channels of distribution. Such strategies can be dangerous, however, depending on how existing customers and retailers react. When Vera Wang decided to also distribute her wares through Kohl’s, Macy’s decided to drop her popular lingerie line. The retailer also cut ties with Liz Claiborne when the fashion brand decided to offer a line called Liz & Co. to JCPenney.¹⁵

## CO-BRANDING

We’ve noted that through a brand extension strategy, a new product can become linked to an existing corporate or family brand that has its own set of associations. An existing brand can also leverage associations by linking itself to other brands from the same or different company. **Co-branding**—also called brand bundling or brand alliances—occurs when two or more existing brands are combined into a joint product or are marketed together in some fashion.¹⁶ A special case of this strategy is ingredient branding, which we’ll discuss in the next section.¹⁷

Co-branding has been around for years; for example, Betty Crocker paired with Sunkist Growers in 1961 to successfully market a lemon chiffon cake mix.¹⁸ Interest in co-branding as a means of building brand equity has increased in recent years. For example, Hershey’s Heath toffee candy bar has not only been extended into several new products—Heath Sensations (bite-sized candies) and Heath Bits and Bits of Brickle (chocolate-covered and plain toffee baking products)—but also has been licensed to a variety of vendors, such as Dairy Queen (with its Blizzard drink), Ben & Jerry’s, and Blue Bunny (with its ice cream bar).

Some other notable supermarket examples of co-branding are Yoplait Trix yogurt, Betty Crocker’s brownie mix with Hershey’s chocolate syrup, and Kellogg’s Cinnabon cereal. In the credit card market, co-branding often links three brands, as in the Shell Gold MasterCard from Citi Cards. With airlines, brand alliances can unite a host of brands, such as Star Alliance, which includes 16 different airlines such as United Airlines, Lufthansa, and Singapore Airlines.
