Figure 15-6 illustrates a framework for managing customer-based brand equity, emphasizing a hierarchical structure. The foundation is built upon four key components: **Brand Identity**, **Brand Meaning**, **Brand Responses**, and **Brand Relationships**. Brand Identity, at the base, encompasses the brand's comprehensive meaning and point of difference. Building upon this, Brand Meaning is developed through a combination of brand performance and imagery. These two foundational elements then influence Brand Responses, which are categorized into brand judgments and brand feelings. Finally, at the apex of the pyramid, Brand Relationships are formed, characterized by various levels of brand loyalty and the extent of the customer-brand connection. This structure highlights how a strong brand identity and meaning are essential for eliciting positive customer responses, ultimately leading to robust and loyal brand relationships.

1. Define the brand hierarchy in terms of the number of levels to use and the relative prominence that brands at different levels will receive when combined to brand any one product.  
2. Create brand associations relevant to as many brands nested at the level below in the hierarchy as possible but sharply differentiate brands at the same level of the hierarchy.  
3. Introduce brand extensions that complement the product mix of the firm, leverage parent brand associations, and enhance parent brand equity.  
4. Clearly establish the roles of brands in the brand portfolio, adding, deleting, and modifying brands as necessary.  
5. Reinforce brand equity over time through marketing actions that consistently convey the meaning of the brand in terms of what products the brand represents, what benefits it supplies, what needs it satisfies, and why it is superior to competitive brands.  
6. Enhance brand equity over time through innovation in product design, manufacturing, and merchandising and continued relevance in user and usage imagery.  
7. Identify differences in consumer behavior in different market segments and adjust the branding program accordingly on a cost-benefit basis.  

Figure 15-7 outlines guidelines for managing brand equity, presenting a structured approach to building and maintaining a strong brand. The framework appears to be hierarchical, starting with foundational elements and progressing to more advanced strategies. Key components likely include defining the brand's core identity and value proposition, followed by strategies for building brand awareness and associations. The guidelines then likely address how to foster brand loyalty and encourage positive customer experiences. Finally, the figure probably details methods for measuring and leveraging brand equity to achieve business objectives, such as increasing market share or commanding premium pricing. The overarching structure emphasizes a systematic, multi-stage process for cultivating and capitalizing on brand equity. To create a strong brand and maximize brand equity, marketing managers must:
