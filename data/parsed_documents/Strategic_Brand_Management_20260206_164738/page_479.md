Shifts in consumer behavior, competitive strategies, government regulations, technological advances and other areas can profoundly affect the fortunes of a brand. Besides these external forces, the firm’s own strategic focus may force minor or major adjustments in the way it markets its brands. Effective brand management thus requires proactive strategies designed to at least maintain—if not actually enhance—customer-based brand equity in the face of all these different forces.

Consider the fate of these four brands: Myspace, Yahoo!, Blockbuster, and Barnes & Noble. In the mid-2000s, each enjoyed a strong market position, if not outright leadership. In just a few short years, however, each was struggling for survival as Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Amazon, respectively, raced past them to establish market superiority. Although there are many explanations, the way these brands were managed certainly contributed to the outcomes.

This chapter considers how to best manage brands over time. Any marketing action a firm takes today can change consumers’ brand awareness or brand image and have an indirect effect on the success of *future* marketing activities (see Figure 13-1). For example, the frequent use of temporary price decreases as sales promotions may create or strengthen a “discount” association to the brand, with potentially adverse implications on customer loyalty and responses to future price changes or non-price-oriented marketing communication efforts.¹

Unfortunately, marketers may have a particularly difficult time trying to anticipate future consumer response: if the new knowledge structures that will influence future consumer response don’t exist until the short-term marketing actions actually occur, how can they realistically simulate future consumer response to permit accurate predictions?

This diagram illustrates a sequential model of consumer response to marketing activity, focusing on the evolution of brand knowledge. It begins with the consumer's response to PAST marketing activity, which shapes their existing Brand knowledge. This existing knowledge then influences their response to CURRENT marketing activity, leading to a CHANGED Brand knowledge. Finally, this updated brand knowledge forms the basis for the consumer's response to FUTURE marketing activity, implying a continuous feedback loop where marketing efforts progressively refine consumer understanding and perception of a brand over time. The structure is linear and process-oriented, demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship between marketing actions and shifts in consumer brand knowledge.

**FIGURE 13-1**  
Understanding the Long-Term Effects of Marketing Actions on Brand Equity The main assertion of this chapter is that marketers must actively manage brand equity over time by reinforcing the brand meaning and, if necessary, by making adjustments to the marketing program to identify new sources of brand equity.
