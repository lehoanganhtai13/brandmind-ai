Creating a brand association to “discount” or “don’t pay full price” diminished brand equity.

### Summary
To build brand equity, marketers must determine strategies for setting prices and adjusting them, if at all, over the short and long run. Increasingly, these decisions will reflect consumer perceptions of value. Value pricing strikes a balance among product design, product costs, and product prices. From a brand equity perspective, consumers must find the price of the brand appropriate and fair given the benefits they feel they receive by the product and its relative advantages with respect to competitive offerings, among other factors. Everyday low pricing is a complementary pricing approach to determine the nature of price discounts and promotions over time that maintains consistently low, value-based prices on major items on a day-to-day basis.

There is always tension between lowering prices on the one hand and increasing consumer perceptions of product quality on the other. Academic researchers Lehmann and Winer believe that although marketers commonly use price reductions to improve perceived value, in reality discounts are often a more expensive way to add value than brand-building marketing activities.[^68] Their argument is that the lost revenue from a lower margin on each item sold is often much greater than the additional cost of value-added activities, primarily because many of these costs are fixed and spread over *all* the units sold, as opposed to the per unit reductions that result from lower prices.

## CHANNEL STRATEGY
The manner by which a product is sold or distributed can have a profound impact on the equity and ultimate sales success of a brand. *Marketing channels* are defined as “sets of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption.”[^69] Channel strategy includes the design and management of intermediaries such as wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and retailers. Let’s look at how channel strategy can contribute to brand equity.[^70]

### Channel Design
A number of possible channel types and arrangements exist, broadly classified into direct and indirect channels. *Direct channels* mean selling through personal contacts from the company to prospective customers by mail, phone, electronic means, in-person visits, and so forth. *Indirect channels* sell through third-party intermediaries such as agents or broker representatives, wholesalers or distributors, and retailers or dealers.

Increasingly, winning channel strategies will be those that can develop “integrated shopping experiences” that combine physical stores, Internet, phone, and catalogs. For example, consider the wide variety of direct and indirect channels by which Nike sells its shoes, apparel, and equipment products:[^71]

* **Branded Niketown stores:** Over 500 Niketown stores, located in prime shopping avenues in metropolitan centers around the globe, offer a complete range of Nike products and serve as showcases for the latest styles. Each store consists of a number of individual shops or pavilions that feature shoes, clothes, and equipment for a different sport (tennis, jogging, biking, or water sports) or different lines within a sport (there might be three basketball shops and two tennis shops). Each shop develops its own concepts with lights, music, temperature, and multimedia displays. Nike is also experimenting with newer, smaller stores that target specific customers and sports (a running-only store in Palo Alto, CA; a soccer-only store in Manchester, England).
* **NikeStore.com:** Nike’s e-commerce site allows consumers to place Internet orders for a range of products or to custom-design some products through NIKEiD, which surpassed $100 million in sales in 2010.
* **Outlet stores:** Nike’s outlet stores feature discounted Nike merchandise.
* **Retail:** Nike products are sold in retail locations such as shoe stores, sporting goods stores, department stores, and clothing stores.
