Such a charge would severely hamper firm profitability; as a result, firms avoid such accounting maneuvers. On the other hand, certain other countries (including Canada, Germany, and Japan) have gone beyond tax deductibility of brand equity to permit some or all of the goodwill arising from an acquisition to be deducted for tax purposes.

### General Approaches.

In determining the value of a brand in an acquisition or merger, firms can choose from three main approaches: the cost, market, and income approaches.³³

The cost approach maintains that brand equity is the amount of money that would be required to reproduce or replace the brand (including all costs for research and development, test marketing, advertising, and so on). One common criticism of approaches relying on historic or replacement cost is that they reward past performance in a way that may bear little relation to future profitability—for example, many brands with expensive introductions have been unsuccessful. On the other hand, for brands that have been around for decades (such as Heinz, Kellogg’s, and Chanel), it would be virtually impossible to find out what the investment in brand development was—and largely irrelevant as well.

It is also obviously easier to estimate costs of tangible assets than intangible assets, but the latter often may lie at the heart of brand equity. Similar problems exist with a replacement cost approach; for example, the cost of replacing a brand depends a great deal on how quickly the process would take and what competitive, legal, and logistical obstacles might be encountered.

According to the second approach, the market approach, we can think of brand equity as the present value of the future economic benefits to be derived by the owner of the asset. In other words, it is the amount an active market would allow so that the asset would exchange between a willing buyer and willing seller. The main problems with this approach are the lack of open market transactions for brand name assets, and the fact that the uniqueness of brands makes extrapolating from one market transaction to another problematic.

The third approach to determining the value of a brand, the income approach, argues that brand equity is the discounted future cash flow from the future earnings stream for the brand. Three such income approaches are as follows:

1. Capitalizing royalty earnings from a brand name (when these can be defined)  
2. Capitalizing the premium profits that are earned by a branded product (by comparing its performance with that of an unbranded product)  
3. Capitalizing the actual profitability of a brand after allowing for the costs of maintaining it and the effects of taxation  

For example, as an example of the first income approach, brand consultancy Brand Finance uses a Royalty Relief methodology for brand valuation. Their approach is based on the premise that brand value can be thought of in terms of what a company avoids in paying a license fee from actually owning the trademark. Their rationale is that such an approach has much credibility with accountants, lawyers, and tax experts because it calculates brand values on the basis of comparable third-party transactions. They use publically available information to estimate future, post-tax royalties of a brand and thus its net present value and overall brand value.³⁴

The next sections and *The Science of Branding* 10-1 describe other income-based valuation approaches.³⁵

### Simon and Sullivan’s Brand Equity Value.

In a seminal academic research study, Simon and Sullivan developed a technique for estimating a firm’s brand equity derived from financial market estimates of brand-related profits.³⁷ They define brand equity as the incremental cash flows that accrue to branded products over and above the cash flows that would result from the sale of unbranded products.

To implement their approach, they begin by estimating the current market value of the firm. They assume the market value of the firm’s securities to provide an unbiased estimate of the future cash flows attributable to all the firm’s assets. Their methodology attempts to extract the value of a firm’s brand equity from the value of the firm’s other assets. The result is an estimate of brand equity based on the financial market valuation of the firm’s future cash flows.
