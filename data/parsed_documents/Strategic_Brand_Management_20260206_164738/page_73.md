# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 2-1

## Brand Critics

She explains the subject of her book as follows:

> The title *No Logo* is not meant to be read as a literal slogan (as in No More Logos!), or a post-logo logo (there is already a No Logo clothing line, I’m told). Rather, it is an attempt to capture an anti-corporate attitude I see emerging among many young activists. This book is hinged on a simple hypothesis: that as more people discover the brand-name secrets of the global logo web, their outrage will fuel the next big political movement, a vast wave of opposition squarely targeting those with very high name-brand recognition.

Klein cites marketing campaigns that exist within schools and universities, among other examples of advertising encroaching on traditionally ad-free space. She asserts that as marketers compete for “eyeballs” using unconventional and unexpected means, fewer ad-free spaces remain, and consumer resentment builds. Klein then argues that the vast number of mergers and acquisitions in the past two decades, and the increasing number of brand extensions, have severely limited consumer choice and engendered additional consumer resentment. She cautions that an inherent danger of building a strong brand is that the public will be all the more eager to see the brand tarnished once unseemly facts surface.

Klein also details the numerous movements that have arisen to protest the growing power of corporations and the proliferation of branded space that accompanies this growth. The author highlights such anticorporate practices as “culture jamming” and “ad-busting,” which serve to subvert and undermine corporate marketing by attacking the marketers on their own terms.

She also discusses the formation of labor activist organizations such as Essential Action and the International Labour Organization, which perform labor monitoring and hold companies accountable for the treatment of their labor forces.

Klein observes that the issues of corporate conduct are now highly politicized. As a result, she notes, 

> “Political rallies, which once wound their predicable course in front of government buildings and consulates, are now just as likely to take place in front of the stores of the corporate giants.” 

Ten years after the fact, Klein revisited her book *No Logo* and actually did apply the concepts to politics in an update.

Klein is certainly not the only critic. In his book *Branding Only Works on Cattle*, brand consultant Jonathan Baskin argues that branding is no longer effective because it relies on the status quo and is not keeping up with consumers’ needs. He faults current brand techniques. In 2007, British writer Neil Boorman started a blog and then published a book called *Bonfire of the Brands* that detailed the breaking of his brand obsession. Boorman refers to himself as a member of 

> “a generation that has been sold to from the day it was born” 

and calls brands 

> “nothing but an expensive con.”

The strength of association between the nodes. Any type of information—whether it’s verbal, abstract, or contextual—can be stored in the memory network.

Using the associative network memory model, let’s think of brand knowledge as consisting of a brand node in memory with a variety of associations linked to it. We can consider brand knowledge as having two components: brand awareness and brand image. **Brand awareness** is related to the strength of the brand node or trace in memory, which we can measure as the consumer’s ability to identify the brand under different conditions.<sup>8</sup> It is a necessary, but not always a sufficient, step in building brand equity. Other considerations, such as the image of the brand, often come into play.

Brand image has long been recognized as an important concept in marketing.<sup>9</sup> Although marketers have not always agreed about how to measure it, one generally accepted view is that, consistent with our associative network memory model, **brand image** is consumers’ perceptions about a brand, as reflected by the brand associations held in consumer memory.<sup>10</sup> In other words, brand associations are the other informational nodes linked to the brand node in memory and contain the meaning of the brand for consumers. Associations come in all forms and may reflect characteristics of the product or aspects independent of the product.

For example, if someone asked you what came to mind when you thought of Apple computers, what would you say? You might reply with associations such as “well-designed,” “easy to use,” “leading-edge technology,” and so forth. Figure 2-2 displays some commonly mentioned associations for Apple that consumers have expressed in the past.<sup>11</sup> The associations that came to *your* mind make up your brand image for Apple. Through breakthrough products and skillful marketing, Apple has been able to achieve a rich brand image made up of a host of Apple logo in center with brand associations around it: User Friendly, Educational, Fun, Desktop Publishing, Friendly, iPod, Graphics, Creative, Cool, Apple Logo, Innovative, Macintosh.
