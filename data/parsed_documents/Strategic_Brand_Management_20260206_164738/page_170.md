# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 4-3

## The Psychology of Packaging

His basic premise is as follows: “Many managers think the package’s main purpose is to encourage purchase. For many consumer packaged goods, the package keeps on marketing the brand and influencing consumers long after it is purchased. After it is home it can influence how a person perceives its taste and value, how much a person uses at a time, and even how he or she uses it.” Here are four of his fascinating findings.

### Packaging Can Influence Taste  
Our sense of taste and touch is very suggestible, and what we see on a package can lead us to taste what we think we are going to taste. In one study, 181 people were sent home with nutrition bars that claimed to contain either “10 grams of protein” or “10 grams of soy protein.” In reality, both nutrition bars were identical, and neither contained any soy. Nevertheless, because many people believe soy to have an unappetizing taste, they rated the bars with “soy” on the package as “grainy,” “unappealing,” and “tasteless.” The right words and image on a package can have a big influence on these expectations.

### Packaging Can Influence Value  
Long after we have bought a product, a package can still lead us to believe we bought it for a good value. First, most people believe the bigger the package, the better the price per ounce. Yet even the shape of a package can influence what we think. One study found that people believe tall, narrow packages hold more of a product than short, wide packages.

### Packaging Can Influence Consumption  
Studies of 48 different types of foods and personal care products have shown that people pour and consume 18–32 percent more of a product as the size of the container doubles. A big part of the reason is that larger sizes subtly suggest a higher “consumption norm.” One study gave Chicago moviegoers free medium-size or large-size popcorn buckets and showed that those given the larger buckets ate 45 percent more! Even when the popcorn was 14 days old, people still ate 32 percent more, though they said they hated it. The same thing happens at parties. MBA students at a Champaign, IL, Super Bowl party were offered Chex Mix from either huge gallon-size bowls or from twice as many half-gallon bowls. Those dishing from the gallon-size bowls took and ate 53 percent more. Shapes affect drinking too: people pour an average of 34 percent more into short wide glasses than tall narrow ones.

### Packaging Can Influence How a Person Uses a Product  
One strategy to increase use of mature products has been to encourage people to use the brand in new situations, like soup for breakfast, or for new uses, like baking soda as a refrigerator deodorizer. An analysis of 26 products and 402 consumers showed that twice as many people learned about the new use from the package than from television ads. Part of the reason such on-package suggestions are effective is that they are guaranteed to reach a person who is already favorable to the brand.

a stagecoach as a symbol and has named individual services to be thematically consistent, for example, creating investment funds under the Stagecoach Funds brand umbrella.

Although the actual product or service itself is critical in building a strong brand, the right brand elements can be invaluable in developing brand equity. Method Products is a prime example of the payoffs from getting both correct.

## METHOD

Celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2011 and still one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States, Method Products is the brainchild of former high school buddies Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry. The company took a big supermarket category—cleaning and household products—and literally and figuratively turned things upside down by taking a completely fresh approach. Ryan and Lowry designed a sleek, uncluttered dish soap container that also had a functional advantage—the bottle, shaped like a chess piece, was built to let soap flow out the bottom, so users would never have to turn it upside down. This signature product, with its pleasant fragrance, was designed by award-winning industrial designer Karim Rashid. By creating a line of nontoxic, biodegradable household cleaning products with bright colors and sleek designs totally unique to the category, Method has surpassed $100 million in annual revenues.
