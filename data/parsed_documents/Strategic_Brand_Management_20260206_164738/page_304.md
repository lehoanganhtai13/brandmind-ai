You would not need to collect them frequently, but they could provide useful explanatory information (see Figure 8-6 for some representative measures).

### How to Conduct Tracking Studies

Which elements of the brand should you use in tracking studies? In general, marketers use the brand name, but it may also make sense to use a logo or symbol in probing brand structures, especially if these elements can play a visible and important role in the decision process.

You also need to decide whom to track, as well as when and where to track.

#### Whom to Track.

Tracking often concentrates on current customers, but it can also be rewarding to monitor nonusers of the brand or even of the product category as a whole, for example, to suggest potential segmentation strategies. Marketers can track those customers loyal to the brand against those loyal to other brands, or against those who switch brands. Among current customers, marketers can distinguish between heavy and light users of the brand. Dividing up the market typically requires different questionnaires (or at least sections of a basic questionnaire) to better capture the specific issues of each segment.

It’s often useful to closely track other types of customers, too, such as channel members and other intermediaries, to understand their perceptions and actions toward the brand. Of particular interest is their image of the brand and how they feel they can help or hurt its equity. Retailers can answer direct questions such as, “Do you feel that products in your store sell faster if they have [the brand name] on them? Why or why not?” Marketers might also want to track employees such as salespeople, to better understand their beliefs about the brand and how they feel they’re contributing to its equity now or could do so in the future. Such tracking may be especially important with service organizations, where employees play profound roles in affecting brand equity.

#### When and Where to Track.

How often should you collect tracking information? One useful approach for monitoring brand associations is continuous tracking studies, which collect information from consumers continually over time. The advantage of continuous tracking is that it smoothes out aberrations or unusual marketing activities or events like a high profile new digital campaign or an unlikely occurrence in the marketing environment to provide a more representative set of baseline measures.

The frequency of such tracking studies, in general, depends on the frequency of product purchase (marketers typically track durable goods less frequently because they are purchased less * Gross domestic product
