# Brand Equity Report

Much of the information relevant to the report may already exist within the organization. Yet it may have been presented to management in disjointed chunks so that no one has a holistic understanding of it. The brand equity report attempts to effectively integrate all these different measures.¹⁴

## Contents.

The brand equity report should describe *what* is happening with the brand as well as *why* it is happening. It should include all relevant internal measures of operational efficiency and effectiveness and external measures of brand performance and sources and outcomes of brand equity.¹⁵

In particular, one section of the report should summarize consumers’ perceptions of key attribute or benefit associations, preferences, and reported behavior as revealed by the tracking study. Another section of the report should include more descriptive market-level information such as the following:

* Product shipments and movement through channels of distribution  
* Retail category trends  
* Relevant cost breakdowns  
* Price and discount schedules where appropriate  
* Sales and market share information broken down by relevant factors (such as geographic region, type of retail account, or customer)  
* Profit assessments  

These measures can provide insight into the market performance component of the brand value chain. Management can compare them to various frames of reference—performance last month/quarter/year—and color code them green, yellow, or red, depending on whether the trends are positive, neutral, or negative, respectively. Internal measures might focus on how much time, money, and labor was being spent on various marketing activities.¹⁶

## Dashboards.

As important as the information making up the brand equity report is the *way* the information is presented. Thus firms are now also exploring how best to display the right data to influence marketing decision makers. Top digital agency R/GA, for example, has created a data-visualization department to reflect the growing importance of presenting information to its clients.¹⁷

A number of firms have implemented *marketing dashboards* to provide comprehensive but actionable summaries of brand-related information. A marketing dashboard functions just like the dashboard of a car. Although they can be valuable tools for companies, if not designed and implemented properly dashboards also can be a big waste of time and money. An early leader on the subject, Pat LaPointe has identified four success factors in developing a successful dashboard:¹⁸

1. Senior-level executives must devote the necessary resources to its development and stay actively involved—delegating the task to lower levels of the organization rarely pays off.  
2. The investment in resources doesn’t stop with launch. Additional resources are required to gather, align, and properly interpret the right information.  
3. Graphics and analytics matter. Excel may be cheap and easy to use, but it can also constrain thinking.  
4. Executives should focus on what can be measured today but also learn more about how to improve the dashboard in the future.  

IT company Unisys successfully developed a dashboard that covered all its geographical areas and applied to all its divisions and business units. Data was collected from a variety of sources—brand tracking, CRM programs, tradeshows, media reports, satisfaction studies, and Web logs—offering views for all levels right up to the CMO.¹⁹

To provide feedback on marketing performance to boards of directors, former Harvard Business School faculty Gail McGovern and John Quelch advocate quarterly tracking reports of the three or four marketing or customer-related metrics that truly drive and predict the company’s Harrah's Harrah’s has an extensive customer information system that helps the company track key metrics.
