# EXTENSION GUIDELINES BASED ON ACADEMIC RESEARCH

Now we turn to some specific guidance about brand extensions. Fortunately, much academic research has focused on this strategy. We summarize some of the important conclusions in Figure 12-7 and describe them in detail in this section.

1. *Successful brand extensions occur when the parent brand has favorable associations and consumers perceive a fit between the parent brand and the extension product.* To better understand the process by which consumers evaluate a brand extension, many academic researchers have adopted a “categorization” perspective. Categorization research has its roots in psychological research, showing that people do not deliberately and individually evaluate each new stimulus to which they are exposed. Instead, they usually evaluate a stimulus in terms of whether they can classify it as a member of a previously defined mental category.

   We could argue that consumers use their categorical knowledge of brands and products to simplify, structure, and interpret their marketing environment.⁵⁷ For example, consumers may see brands as categories that over time have acquired a number of specific attributes based on their individual members.⁵⁸ As Method has expanded its range of cleaning

> 1. Successful brand extensions occur when the parent brand is seen as having favorable associations and there is a perception of fit between the parent brand and the extension product.  
> 2. There are many bases of fit: product-related attributes and benefits as well as non-product-related attributes and benefits related to common usage situations or user types.  
> 3. Depending on consumer knowledge of the product categories, perceptions of fit may be based on technical or manufacturing commonalities or more surface considerations such as necessary or situational complementarity.  
> 4. High-quality brands stretch farther than average-quality brands, although both types of brands have boundaries.  
> 5. A brand that is seen as prototypical of a product category can be difficult to extend outside the category.  
> 6. Concrete attribute associations tend to be more difficult to extend than abstract benefit associations.  
> 7. Consumers may transfer associations that are positive in the original product class but become negative in the extension context.  
> 8. Consumers may infer negative associations about an extension, perhaps even based on other inferred positive associations.  
> 9. It can be difficult to extend into a product class that is seen as easy to make.  
> 10. A successful extension can not only contribute to the parent brand image but also enable a brand to be extended even farther.  
> 11. An unsuccessful extension hurts the parent brand only when there is a strong basis of fit between the two.  
> 12. An unsuccessful extension does not prevent a firm from backtracking and introducing a more similar extension.  
> 13. Vertical extensions can be difficult and often require sub-branding strategies.  
> 14. The most effective advertising strategy for an extension is one that emphasizes information about the extension (rather than reminders about the parent brand).  
> 15. Individual differences can affect how consumers make an extension decision, and will moderate extension effects.  
> 16. Cultural differences across markets can influence extension success.
