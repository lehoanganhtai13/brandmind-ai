> **Key Differences**  
> A few characteristics distinguish the Prophet brand valuation methodology. Other models typically look at only five years of future cash flows, add a perpetuity based on a discounted sixth year, and simply divide the sixth year by the discount rate. Frequently the perpetuity represents one-quarter to one-third of the total brand value; the five-year discounted cash flow into which most of the work has been invested results in only a small amount of the valuation.  
> The Prophet approach models the entire expected economic life of the brand in terms of the franchise run (its rise) and decay (its decline). The nature of the brand category (category expected life) and the relative strength of the brand as measured by the BKS determine the total number of years for the present-value calculation. The proportions are reversed compared to many other models, with the major portion of the Prophet valuation located in the early franchise run, which includes the five-year discounted part of the cash flow projection. This makes the valuation sensitive to changes in the BKS and early cash flows.  
> Also, like most corporate finance valuations, the Prophet approach uses a classically estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC). It takes specific risk into account in the cash flows, as opposed to the discount rate. Other methodologies use the market risk and beta components of WACC to insert their consumer-driven brand risk premiums.

From these basic premises, Simon and Sullivan derive their methodology to extract the value of brand equity from the financial market value of the firm. The total asset value of the firm is the sum of the market value of common stock, preferred stock, long-term debt, and short-term debt. The value of intangible assets is captured in the ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of its tangible assets. There are three categories of intangible assets: brand equity, nonbrand factors that reduce the firm’s costs relative to competitors like R&D and patents, and industry-wide factors that permit monopoly profits, such as regulation. By considering factors such as the age of the brand, order of entry in the category, and current and past advertising share, Simon and Sullivan then provide estimates of brand equity.

### Interbrand’s Brand Valuation Methodology  
Interbrand is probably the premier brand valuation firm. Figure 1-5 from Chapter 1 listed the 25 most valuable global brands according to Interbrand. In developing its brand valuation methodology, Interbrand approached the problem by assuming that the value of a brand, like the value of any other economic asset, was the present worth of the benefits of future ownership. In other words, according to Interbrand, brand valuation is based on an assessment of what the value is today of the earnings or cash flow the brand can be expected to generate in the future. [38]  
Because Interbrand’s approach looks at the ongoing investment and management of the brand as an economic asset, it takes into account all the different ways in which a brand benefits.
