Prior research has shown that mere satisfaction may not be enough.<sup>33</sup> Xerox found that when customer satisfaction was ranked on a scale of 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 5 (completely satisfied), customers who rated Xerox products and services as “4”—and thus were satisfied—were six times more likely to defect to competitors than those customers who provided ratings of “5.”<sup>34</sup>  
Similarly, loyalty guru Frederick Reichheld points out that although more than 90 percent of car buyers are satisfied or very satisfied when they drive away from the dealer’s showroom, fewer than half buy the same brand of automobile the next time.<sup>35</sup> Creating greater loyalty requires creating deeper attitudinal attachment, through marketing programs and products and services that fully satisfy consumer needs.

### Sense of Community.  
The brand may also take on broader meaning to the customer by conveying a sense of *community*.<sup>36</sup> Identification with a brand community may reflect an important social phenomenon in which customers feel a kinship or affiliation with other people associated with the brand, whether fellow brand users or customers, or employees or representatives of the company. A brand community can exist online or off-line.<sup>37</sup> Branding Brief 3-1 profiles three company-initiated programs to help build brand communities. A stronger sense of community among loyal users can engender favorable brand attitudes and intentions.<sup>38</sup>

### Active Engagement.  
Finally, perhaps the strongest affirmation of brand loyalty occurs when customers are *engaged*, or willing to invest time, energy, money, or other resources in the brand beyond those expended during purchase or consumption of the brand.<sup>39</sup> For example, customers may choose to join a club centered on a brand, receive updates, and exchange correspondence with other brand users or formal or informal representatives of the brand itself. Companies are making it increasingly easy for customers to buy a range of branded merchandise so they can literally express their loyalty.

### BMW  
BMW’s lifestyle business was started 15 years ago as a marketing initiative whose objectives were to broaden the brand’s presence and strengthen loyalty. The lifestyle division focuses primarily on selling mobility products, including bicycles and skateboards for kids, and aims for a profit margin (7%) similar to what BMW generates from sales of its cars. More than 2,000 products are sold, from €39 ($52) Mini rain boots to the highly regarded €2750 ($3,620) lightweight M Carbon Racer bike from BMW’s M performance unit. These are not your run-of-the-mill products, though. BMW’s €79 ($105) Snow Racer sled has replaceable metal runners, a suspension-system in the red steering ski, and a horn to warn inattentive passersby. The battery-powered Baby Racer, designed internally by BMW Designworks, comes in three different models and costs €79 ($106). Winner of several design prizes and featured in the MOMA in New York, it sells 60,000 units a year. In China, which is now its third-largest market for car sales, BMW opened a store selling merchandise a year before it began assembling cars in the country and had more than 50 BMW stores there by the end of 2012.<sup>40</sup>

BMW has a highly successful licensing business—exemplified by this popular Baby Racer for kids—to help customers find more ways to experience the brand.

Customers may choose to visit brand-related Web sites, participate in chat rooms, or post to discussions. In this case, customers themselves became brand evangelists and ambassadors and help communicate about the brand and strengthen the brand ties of others. Strong attitudinal attachment or social identity or both are typically necessary, however, for active engagement with the brand to occur.
