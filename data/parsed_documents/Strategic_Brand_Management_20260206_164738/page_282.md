Even worse, some feel the fees celebrities earn to appear in commercials add a significant and unnecessary cost to the brand. In reality, celebrities often do not come cheap and can demand literally millions of dollars for endorsements.

Celebrities also can be difficult to work with and may not willingly follow the marketing direction of the brand. Tennis player Andre Agassi tried Nike’s patience when—at the same time he was advertising for Nike—he appeared in commercials for the Canon Rebel camera. In these ads, he looked into the camera and proclaimed “Image Is Everything”—the antithesis of the “authentic athletic performance” positioning that has been the foundation of Nike’s brand equity. Winning the French Open, however, put Agassi back in Nike’s good graces.

Finally, as noted in Chapter 6, celebrities may distract attention from the brand in ads so that consumers notice the stars but have trouble remembering the advertised brand. PepsiCo decided to drop singers Beyoncé Knowles and Britney Spears from high-profile ad campaigns when they felt the Pepsi brand did not get the same promotion boost from the campaign that the stars were getting. The firm decided to put the spotlight back on the product with its endorsement-free follow-up, “Pepsi. It’s the Cola.” After signing Celine Dion for a three-year, $14 million deal, Chrysler dumped her in the first year when commercials featuring Dion driving a Pacifica produced great sales for the singer, but not for the car!

Brands can become overreliant on a celebrity. Founder and chairman Dave Thomas was an effective pitchman for his Wendy’s restaurant chain because of his down-home, unpretentious, folksy style and strong product focus. Recognized by over 90 percent of adult consumers, he appeared in hundreds of commercials over a 12-year period until his death in early 2002.<sup>42</sup> The brand struggled for years afterward, however, trying to find the right advertising approach to replace him.

## Guidelines

To overcome these problems, marketers should strategically evaluate, select, and use celebrity spokespeople. First, choose a well-known and well-defined celebrity whose associations are relevant to the brand and likely to be transferable. For example, despite false starts for his retirement, Brett Favre’s rugged, down-to-earth persona fits well for the backyard football games in the “Real. Comfortable. Jeans.” Wrangler ads.

Then, there must be a logical fit between the brand and the person.<sup>43</sup> To reduce confusion or dilution, the celebrity ideally will not be linked to a number of other brands or be overexposed. Popular Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan has been criticized for endorsing too many
