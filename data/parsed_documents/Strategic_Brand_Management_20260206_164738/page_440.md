For example, many specific-purpose cleaning products have broadened their meaning to be seen as multipurpose, including Lysol, Comet, and Mr. Clean. Similarly, the $245 billion enterprise software market is characterized by a few megabrands like Oracle and SAP that compete in multiple segments with multiple product offerings. Although at one time these different brands were limited to a few specific products, they have broadened their meaning through brand extensions and acquisitions to represent “complete business software solutions.”[^17]

### Enhance the Parent Brand Image.

According to the customer-based brand equity model, one desirable outcome of a successful brand extension is that it may enhance the parent brand image by strengthening an existing brand association, improving the favorability of an existing brand association, adding a new brand association, or a combination of these.

One common way a brand extension affects the parent brand image is by helping clarify its core brand values and associations. Core brand associations, as we defined them in Chapter 3, are those attributes and benefits that come to characterize all the products in the brand line and, as a result, are those with which consumers often have the strongest associations. For example, Nike has expanded from running shoes to other athletic shoes, athletic clothing, and athletic equipment, strengthening its associations to “peak performance” and “sports” in the process.

Another type of association that successful brand extensions may improve is consumer perceptions of the company’s credibility. For example, one research study showed that a successful corporate brand extension led to improved perceptions of the expertise, trustworthiness, and likability of the company.[^18]

Choosing to launch a new product or service with a completely new brand name means forgoing these feedback benefits. In the late 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, several firms introduced online versions of their services under a separate brand name. For example, Bank One, a leading brand at the time, opened its online bank services under the Wingspan brand name. Besides increasing the difficulty and expense of launching a new brand, these companies also lost the opportunity to modernize the parent brand image and improve its technological credentials. In many cases, the new ventures failed and their capabilities were folded back into the parent organization.

### Bring New Customers into the Brand Franchise and Increase Market Coverage.

Line extensions can benefit the parent brand by expanding market coverage, such as by offering a product benefit whose absence may have prevented consumers from trying the brand. For example, when Tylenol introduced a capsule form of its acetaminophen pain reliever, it was able to attract consumers who had difficulty swallowing tablets and might have otherwise avoided the brand.

Creating “news” and bringing attention to the parent brand may benefit the family brand as a whole. Through the skillful introduction of extensions, Tide as a family brand has managed to maintain its market leadership and actual market share—roughly 40 percent in the United States—from the 1950s to the present. Ocean Spray has successfully introduced a wide range of extensions to offer consumers more ways to enjoy cranberries.

### OCEAN SPRAY

The growers’ cooperative Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., found itself in a difficult position around 2004. With growth in carbonated beverages slowing, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo began to move aggressively into noncarbonated drinks, including juices. Ocean Spray contemplated selling the brand to PepsiCo, but ultimately the coop voted to remain independent. To remain competitive with these larger players, however, Ocean Spray has continued to introduce a number of brand extensions, supported by well-integrated marketing campaigns. Its expanded product mix now includes regular, diet, and light versions of many of its popular cocktail, juice drink, and blends beverages; Craisins dried cranberries and trail mix; cranberry sauce; fresh fruit; and fruit-flavored snacks. The coop has introduced new flavor varieties based on blueberry and cherry and a line of energy juice drinks and sparkling beverages.
