## THIRD-PARTY SOURCES

Finally, marketers can create secondary associations in a number of different ways by linking the brand to various third-party sources. For example, the *Good Housekeeping* seal has been seen as a mark of quality for decades, offering product replacement or refunds for defective products for up to two years from purchase. Endorsements from leading magazines like *PC* magazine, organizations like the American Dental Association, acknowledged experts such as film critic Roger Ebert, or carefully selected Elite critics of the online Yelp consumer review site can obviously improve perceptions of and attitudes toward brands.

Third-party sources can be especially credible sources. As a result, marketers often feature them in advertising campaigns and selling efforts. J.D. Power and Associates’ well-publicized Customer Satisfaction Index helped to cultivate an image of quality for Japanese automakers in the 1980s, with a corresponding adverse impact on the quality image of their U.S. rivals. In the 1990s, they began to rank quality in other industries, such as airlines, credit cards, rental cars, and phone service, and top-rated brands in these categories began to feature their awards in ad campaigns. Grey Goose vodka cleverly employed a third-party endorsement to drive sales.

### GREY GOOSE

Sidney Frank first found success in the liquor industry with a little-known German liqueur, Jagermeister, which he began to market in the United States in the mid-1980s and drove to 700,000 annual cases in sales and market leadership by 2001. Turning his sights to the high-margin super-premium market, Frank decided to create a French vodka that would use water from the Cognac region and be distilled by the makers of Cardin brandy. Branded as “Grey Goose,” the product had distinctive packaging—a must in the category—with a bottle taller than competitors that combined clear and frosted glass with a cutaway of geese in flight and the French flag. But perhaps the most important factor in the brand’s eventual success was a taste-test result from the Beverage Testing Institute that ranked Grey Goose as the number-one imported vodka. Fueled by exhaustive advertising that trumpeted its big win as “the World’s Best-Tasting Vodka,” Grey Goose became a top seller. Frank eventually sold Grey Goose Vodka brand to Bacardi in 2004 for a stunning $2.2 billion. Its success continues to this day. Despite the fact that vodka has been characterized as essentially odorless and tasteless, it is consistently ranked as the top brand of vodka brand in consumer loyalty polls on the basis of image, versatility, and smoothness.<sup>49</sup> Distinctive packaging and taste-test awards have propelled Grey Goose to a leadership position in the vodka category.
