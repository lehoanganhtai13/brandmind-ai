With a tagline “Miles Away from Ordinary,” the campaign was designed to transform drinkers—at least mentally—to sunny, tranquil beaches.[27]  
A brand that successfully injected some emotion into an industry is W hotels.

## W HOTELS

Launched in the early era of boutique hotels, the Starwood-owned W hotel chain quickly gained a reputation as being the cool place for hipsters to visit, either as hotel guests or just as local residents looking for a fun night out. In a 2009 press release, Starwood described W Hotels as:

> “An innovative luxury lifestyle brand and the hotel category buster with 26 properties in the most vibrant destinations around the world. Inspiring, iconic, innovative and influential, W Hotels provides the ultimate in insider access to a world of ‘Wow.’ Each hotel offers a unique mix of innovative design and passions around design, architecture, fashion, music, entertainment, pop culture, and everything in between. W Hotels are unique and individual expressions of modern living, reflected in the brand’s sensibility to a holistic lifestyle experience with cutting-edge design, contemporary restaurant concepts, glamorous nightlife experiences, and signature spas.”

During Media Summit and Investor Day events held in 2006, Starwood management revealed that they positioned W as follows:  
“From San Diego to Seoul . . . and soon Hoboken to Hong Kong, W’s flirty, insider, escape offers guests unique experiences around the warmth of cool.” Clearly W Hotels are every bit as much about the emotions and experiences they create as they are about getting a comfortable night’s rest.[28]

More and more firms are attempting to tap into more consumer emotions with their brands. The following are six important types of brand-building feelings:[29]

1. **Warmth:** The brand evokes soothing types of feelings and makes consumers feel a sense of calm or peacefulness. Consumers may feel sentimental, warmhearted, or affectionate about the brand. Many heritage brands such as Welch’s jelly, Quaker oatmeal, and Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup tap into feelings of warmth.  
2. **Fun:** Upbeat types of feelings make consumers feel amused, lighthearted, joyous, playful, cheerful, and so on. With its iconic characters and theme park rides, Disney is a brand often associated with fun.
