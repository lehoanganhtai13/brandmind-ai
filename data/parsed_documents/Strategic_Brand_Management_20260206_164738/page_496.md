According to the model, we have two strategic options:

1. Expand the depth or breadth of brand awareness, or both, by improving consumer recall and recognition of the brand during purchase or consumption settings.  
2. Improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of the brand associations making up the brand image. This may require programs directed at existing or new brand associations.

By enhancing brand salience and brand meaning in these ways, we can achieve more favorable responses and greater brand resonance.

Tactically, we can refurbish lost sources of brand equity and establish new ones in the same three ways we create sources of brand equity to start with: by changing brand elements, changing the supporting marketing program, or leveraging new secondary associations. Next, we consider several alternative strategies to achieve these goals.

## Expanding Brand Awareness

With a fading brand, often *depth* of awareness is not the problem—consumers can still recognize or recall the brand under certain circumstances. Rather, the *breadth* of brand awareness is the stumbling block—consumers tend to think of the brand only in very narrow ways. As we suggested in Chapter 3, one powerful means of building brand equity is to increase the breadth of brand awareness, making sure consumers don’t overlook the brand.

Assuming a brand has a reasonable level of consumer awareness and a positive brand image, perhaps the most appropriate starting point is to increase usage. This approach often does not require difficult and costly changes in brand image or positioning, but rather relatively easier changes in brand salience and awareness.

We can increase usage either by increasing the level or the quantity of consumption (how *much* consumers use the brand), or by increasing the frequency of consumption (how *often* they use it). It is probably easier to increase the number of times a consumer uses the product than to actually change the amount he or she uses at any one time. (A possible exception is impulse-purchase products like soft drinks and snacks, whose usage increases when the product is more available.) Increasing frequency of use is particularly attractive for category leaders with large market share; it requires either identifying new opportunities to use the brand in the same basic way or identifying completely new and different ways to use it. Let’s look at both approaches.

### Identifying Additional or New Usage Opportunities.

To identify additional or new opportunities for consumers to use the brand more—albeit in the same basic way—marketers should design a marketing program to include both of the following:

* Communications about the appropriateness and advantages of using the brand more frequently in existing situations or in new situations  
* Reminders to consumers to actually use the brand as close as possible in time to those situations for which it could be used

For many brands, increasing usage may be as simple as improving top-of-mind awareness through reminder advertising (as V8 vegetable juice did with its classic “Wow! I Could Have Had Had a V8” ad campaign). In other cases, more creative retrieval cues may be necessary. Consumers often adopt “functional fixedness” with a brand, which makes it easy to ignore in nontraditional consumption settings.

For example, consumers see some brands as appropriate only for special occasions. An effective strategy here may be to redefine what it means for something to be “special.” Chivas Regal ran a print ad campaign for its Blended Scotch with the theme “What are you saving the Chivas for?” The ads included headlines such as “Sometimes life begins when the baby-sitter arrives,” “Your Scotch and soda is only as good as your Scotch and soda,” and “If you think people might think you order Chivas to show off, maybe you’re thinking too much.” For campaigns like this to work, however, the brand has to retain its “premium” brand association—a key source of equity—while convincing consumers to adopt broader usage habits at the same time.
