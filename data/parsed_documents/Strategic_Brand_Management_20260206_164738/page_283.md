Unfortunately, many of the products he has endorsed have run into problems—a shampoo was alleged to contain carcinogens, an auto repair school was hit by a diploma scandal, and makers of both video compact discs and an educational computer went out of business. As one Chinese editorial commented: “He has become the coolest spokesperson in history—a man who can destroy anything!”[^44]

Third, the advertising and communication program should use the celebrity in a creative fashion that highlights the relevant associations and encourages their transfer. Dennis Haysbert has played the president of the United States in the TV series *24* and adopts a similarly stately, reassuring tone for his spokesperson role in the “You’re in Good Hands” ads for Allstate insurance. William Shatner’s humorous Priceline ads take a completely different tack and take advantage of the actor’s self-deprecating, campy wit to draw attention to its discount message.

Finally, marketing research must help identify potential endorser candidates and facilitate the development of the proper marketing program, as well as track its effectiveness.

### Q SCORES

Marketing Evaluations conducts surveys to determine “Q Scores” for a broad range of entertainers and other public figures like TV performers, news and sports anchors, and reporters, athletes, and models. Each performer is rated on the following scale: “One of My Favorites,” “Very Good,” “Good,” “Fair,” “Poor,” and “Never Seen or Heard of Before.” The sum of the “Favorite” through “Poor” ratings is “Total Familiar.” Because some performers are not very well known, a positive Q Score is a ratio of the “One of My Favorites” rating to the “Total Familiar” rating and a negative Q Score is a ratio of the sum of “Poor” and “Fair” ratings to the “Total Familiar” rating. Q Scores thus capture how appealing or unappealing a public figure is among those who do know him or her. Q Scores will move around, depending on the fame and fortune of the subject.

In January 2010, in a poll of the general population, 24 percent of people viewed NBA star Lebron James in a positive light, compared to 22 percent who had a negative opinion. These were the highest scores ever seen by Marketing Evaluations for an athlete—the average sports personality has a 15 percent positive score and 24 percent negative score. After James’s “decision” and his messy departure from Cleveland to play for the Miami Heat, a September 2010 poll revealed that only 14 percent of the population saw him in a positive light, while 39 percent had a negative opinion, the steepest decline for a sports personality in the 45-year history of Q Scores. By February 2011, the positive and negative scores had improved to 17 percent and 33 percent—progress, but still a far cry from his peak. James’s tarnished image certainly did not immediately affect his endorsement portfolio, however, which was estimated to total over $48 million in 2011, landing him in the Top 10 of *Forbes* magazine’s Celebrity 100 ranking of power.[^45]

Celebrities themselves must manage their own “brands” to ensure that they provide value. By the same token, anyone with a public profile, even if just within the company in which he or she works, should consider how to best manage his or her brand image.[^46] Branding Brief 7-4 offers some thoughts about how personal branding works in general and how it differs from more traditional branding for products and services.

## SPORTING, CULTURAL, OR OTHER EVENTS

As Chapter 6 described, events have their own set of associations that may become linked to a sponsoring brand under certain conditions. Sponsored events can contribute to brand equity by becoming associated to the brand and improving brand awareness, adding new associations, or improving the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of existing associations.[^47]

The main means by which an event can transfer associations is credibility. A brand may seem more likable or perhaps even trustworthy or expert by virtue of becoming linked to an event. The extent to which this transfer takes place will depend on which events are selected and how the sponsorship program is designed and integrated into the entire marketing program to build brand equity. *Brand Focus 7.0* discusses sponsorship strategies for the Olympic Games. Qantas is one of the leading companies making major investments in sports marketing.
