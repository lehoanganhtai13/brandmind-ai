In essence, the marketer is borrowing or leveraging some other associations for the brand to create some associations of the brand’s own and thus help build its brand equity. Chapter 7 describes the means of leveraging brand equity.

## Measuring and Interpreting Brand Performance

To manage their brands profitably, managers must successfully design and implement a brand equity measurement system. A *brand equity measurement system* is a set of research procedures designed to provide timely, accurate, and actionable information for marketers so that they can make the best possible tactical decisions in the short run and the best strategic decisions in the long run. As described in Chapter 8, implementing such a system involves three key steps—conducting *brand audits*, designing *brand tracking* studies, and establishing a *brand equity management system*.

The task of determining or evaluating a brand’s positioning often benefits from a brand audit. A *brand audit* is a comprehensive examination of a brand to assess its health, uncover its sources of equity, and suggest ways to improve and leverage that equity. A brand audit requires understanding sources of brand equity from the perspective of both the firm and the consumer.

Once marketers have determined the brand positioning strategy, they are ready to put into place the actual marketing program to create, strengthen, or maintain brand associations. *Brand tracking studies* collect information from consumers on a routine basis over time, typically through quantitative measures of brand performance on a number of key dimensions marketers can identify in the brand audit or other means. Chapters 9 and 10 describe a number of measures to operationalize it.

A *brand equity management system* is a set of organizational processes designed to improve the understanding and use of the brand equity concept within a firm. Three major steps help implement a brand equity management system: creating brand equity charters, assembling brand equity reports, and defining brand equity responsibilities.

## Growing and Sustaining Brand Equity

Maintaining and expanding on brand equity can be quite challenging. Brand equity management activities take a broader and more diverse perspective of the brand’s equity—understanding how branding strategies should reflect corporate concerns and be adjusted, if at all, over time or over geographical boundaries or multiple market segments.

### Defining Brand Architecture.

The firm’s brand architecture provides general guidelines about its branding strategy and which brand elements to apply across all the different products sold by the firm. Two key concepts in defining brand architecture are brand portfolios and the brand hierarchy. The *brand portfolio* is the set of different brands that a particular firm offers for sale to buyers in a particular category. The *brand hierarchy* displays the number and nature of common and distinctive brand components across the firm’s set of brands. Chapter 11 reviews a three-step approach to brand architecture and how to devise brand portfolios and hierarchies. Chapter 12 concentrates on the topic of brand extensions in which an existing brand is used to launch a product into a different category or sub-category.

### Managing Brand Equity over Time.

Effective brand management also requires taking a long-term view of marketing decisions. A long-term perspective of brand management recognizes that any changes in the supporting marketing program for a brand may, by changing consumer knowledge, affect the success of future marketing programs. A long-term view also produces proactive strategies designed to maintain and enhance customer-based brand equity over time and reactive strategies to revitalize a brand that encounters some difficulties or problems. Chapter 13 outlines issues related to managing brand equity over time.

### Managing Brand Equity over Geographic Boundaries, Cultures, and Market Segments.

Another important consideration in managing brand equity is recognizing and accounting for different types of consumers in developing branding and marketing programs. International factors and global branding strategies are particularly important in these decisions. In expanding a brand overseas, managers need to build equity by relying on specific knowledge about the experience and behaviors of those market segments. Chapter 14 examines issues related to broadening of brand equity across market segments.
