Arriving at the proper positioning requires establishing the correct points-of-difference and points-of-parity associations.

**Points-of-Difference Associations.**  
*Points-of-difference* (PODs) are formally defined as attributes or benefits that consumers strongly associate with a brand, positively evaluate, and believe that they could not find to the same extent with a competitive brand.³⁹ Although myriad different types of brand associations are possible, we can classify candidates as either functional, performance-related considerations or as abstract, imagery-related considerations.

Consumers’ actual brand choices often depend on the perceived uniqueness of brand associations. Swedish retailer Ikea took a luxury product—home furnishings and furniture—and made it a reasonably priced alternative for the mass market. Ikea supports its low prices by having customers serve themselves and deliver and assemble their own purchases. Ikea also gains a point-of-difference through its product offerings. As one commentator noted, “Ikea built their reputation on the notion that Sweden produces good, safe, well-built things for the masses. They have some of the most innovative designs at the lowest cost out there.”⁴⁰ As another example, consider Subaru.

## SUBARU

By 1993, Subaru was selling only 104,000 cars annually in the United States, down 60 percent from its earlier peak. Cumulative U.S. losses approached $1 billion. Advertised as “Inexpensive and Built to Stay That Way,” Subaru was seen as a me-too car that was undifferentiated from Toyota, Honda, and all their followers. To provide a clear, distinct image, Subaru decided to sell only all-wheel-drive in its passenger cars. After upgrading its luxury image—and increasing its price—Subaru sold over 187,000 cars by 2004. Even more recently, the company launched its “Share the Love” ad campaign, which focused on the fun, adventure, and experiences the vehicles afford and the strong passion and loyalty its customers have for the brand. With its “Share the Love Event,” Subaru created a cause program in which it donates to one of five charities a customer can designate when he or she leases or buys a new car. Subaru’s unique emotional play for relatively upscale buyers who value freedom and frugality paid off in the 2008–2010 recession, when it bucked the industry tide to experience record sales.⁴¹

Points-of-difference may rely on performance attributes (Hyundai provides six front and back seat “side curtain” airbags as standard equipment on all its models for increased safety) or performance benefits (Magnavox’s electronic products have “consumer-friendly” technological features, such as television sets with “Smart Sound” to keep volume levels constant while flipping through channels and commercial breaks, and “Smart Picture” to automatically adjust picture settings to optimal levels).
