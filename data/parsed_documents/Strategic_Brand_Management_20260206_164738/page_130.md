# Value Stages

## Marketing Program Investment.

Any marketing program investment that can contribute to brand value development, intentionally or not, falls into this first value stage. Chapters 4–7 outline many such marketing activities, like product research, development, and design; trade or intermediary support; marketing communications including advertising, promotion, sponsorship, direct and interactive marketing, personal selling, publicity, and public relations; and employee training. A big investment of course does not guarantee success. The ability of a marketing program investment to transfer or multiply farther down the chain depends on *qualitative* aspects of the marketing program and the program quality multiplier.

## Program Quality Multiplier.

The ability of the marketing program to affect the customer mind-set will depend on its quality. Throughout the book, we review a number of different means to judge the quality of a marketing program. One handy way to remember some key considerations is through the acronym DRIVE, as follows:

1. **Distinctiveness:** How unique is the marketing program? How creative or differentiating is it?  
2. **Relevance:** How meaningful is the marketing program to customers? Do consumers feel the brand is one they should seriously consider?  
3. **Integrated:** How well integrated is the marketing program at one point in time and over time? Do all aspects combine to create the biggest impact with customers as possible? Does the marketing program relate effectively to past marketing programs and properly balance continuity and change, evolving the brand in the right direction?  
4. **Value:** How much short-run and long-run value does the marketing program create? Will it profitably drive sales in the short run? Will it build brand equity in the long run?  
5. **Excellence:** Is the individual marketing activity designed to satisfy the highest standards? Does it reflect state-of-the art thinking and corporate wisdom as success factors for that particular type of marketing activity?

Not surprisingly, a well-integrated marketing program, carefully designed and implemented to be highly relevant and unique, is likely to achieve a greater return on investment from marketing program expenditures. For example, despite being outspent by such beverage brand giants as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Budweiser, the California Milk Processor Board was able to reverse a decades-long decline in consumption of milk in California through the well-designed and executed “Got Milk?” campaign.

On the other hand, numerous marketers have found that expensive marketing programs do not necessarily produce sales unless they are well conceived. For example, through the years, brands such as Michelob, Minute Maid, 7UP, and others have seen their sales slide despite sizable marketing expenditures because of poorly targeted and delivered marketing campaigns.

## Customer Mind-Set.

In what ways have customers been changed as a result of the marketing program? How have those changes manifested themselves in the customer mind-set?

Remember, the customer mind-set includes everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand: thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes. In its totality, the brand resonance model captures a wide range of aspects of the customer mind-set. To provide a concise summary, a shorter “5 As” list can highlight important measures of the customer mind-set as suggested by the resonance model:

1. **Brand Awareness:** The extent and ease with which customers recall and recognize the brand and can identify the products and services with which it is associated.  
2. **Brand Associations:** The strength, favorability, and uniqueness of perceived attributes and benefits for the brand. Brand associations often represent key sources of brand value, because they are the means by which consumers feel brands satisfy their needs.  
3. **Brand Attitudes:** Overall evaluations of the brand in terms of its quality and the satisfaction it generates.
