conjoint measurement with just two variables––brand and price. Consumers make a series of simulated purchase choices between different combinations of brands and prices. Each choice triggers an increase in the price of the selected brand, forcing the consumer to choose between buying a preferred brand and paying less. In this way, consumers reveal how much their brand loyalty is worth and, conversely, which brands they would relinquish for a lower price.

Academic researchers with an interest in brand image and equity have used other variations and applications of conjoint analysis. For example, Rangaswamy, Burke, and Oliva use conjoint analysis to explore how brand names interact with physical product features to affect the extendability of brand names to new product categories.<sup>14</sup> Barich and Srinivasan apply conjoint analysis to corporate image programs, to show how it can determine the company attributes relevant to customers, rank the importance of those attributes, estimate the costs of making improvements (or correcting customer perceptions), and prioritize image goals to obtain the maximum benefit, in terms of improved perceptions, for the resources spent.<sup>15</sup>

**Critique.** The main advantage of the conjoint-based approach is that it allows us to study different brands and different aspects of the product or marketing program (product composition, price, distribution outlets, and so on) simultaneously. Thus, we can uncover information about consumers’ responses to different marketing activities for both the focal and competing brands.

One of the disadvantages of conjoint analysis is that marketing profiles may violate consumers’ expectations based on what they already know about brands. Thus, we must take care that consumers do not evaluate unrealistic product profiles or scenarios. It can also be difficult to specify and interpret brand attribute levels, although some useful guidelines have been put forth to more effectively apply conjoint analysis to brand positioning.<sup>16</sup>

# HOLISTIC METHODS

We use comparative methods to approximate specific benefits of brand equity. *Holistic methods* place an overall value on the brand in either abstract utility terms or concrete financial terms. Thus, holistic methods attempt to “net out” various considerations to determine the unique contribution of the brand. The *residual approach* examines the value of the brand by subtracting consumers’ preferences for the brand––based on physical product attributes alone––from their overall brand preferences. The *valuation approach* places a financial value on brand equity for accounting purposes, mergers and acquisitions, or other such reasons. After an example from Liz Claiborne, we’ll look at each of these approaches.
