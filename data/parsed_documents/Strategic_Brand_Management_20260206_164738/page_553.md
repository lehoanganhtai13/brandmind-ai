> Guidelines for Measuring Brand Equity

> 1. Formalize the firm’s view of brand equity into a document, the brand equity charter, that provides relevant branding guidelines to marketing managers.  
> 2. Conduct brand inventories to profile how all of the products sold by a company are branded and marketed and conduct brand exploratories to understand what consumers think and feel about a brand as part of periodic brand audits to assess the health of brands, understand their sources of brand equity, and suggest ways to improve and leverage that equity.  
> 3. Conduct consumer tracking studies on a routine basis to provide current information as to how brands are performing with respect to the key sources and outcomes of brand equity as identified by the brand audit.  
> 4. Assemble results of tracking survey and other relevant outcome measures into a brand equity report to be distributed on a regular basis to provide descriptive information as to what is happening with a brand as well as diagnostic information as to why it is happening.  
> 5. Establish a person or department to oversee the implementation of the brand equity charter and brand equity reports to make sure that, as much as possible, product and marketing actions across divisions and geographic boundaries are done in a way that reflects the spirit of the charter and the substance of the report so as to maximize the long-term equity of the brand.

Implementing a brand equity measurement system has three steps: (1) conducting brand audits, (2) designing brand tracking studies, and (3) establishing a brand equity management system.  
Guidelines for each of these areas are summarized in Figure 15-5.

**Themes.** The dominant theme in measuring brand equity is the need to employ a full complement of research techniques and processes that capture as much as possible the richness and complexity of brand equity. We need multiple techniques and measures to tap into all the various sources and outcomes of brand equity, to help interpret brand equity research, and to ensure that we get actionable information at the right time.

### Managing Brand Equity.  
Finally, managing brand equity requires taking a broad, long-term perspective of brands. A broad view of brand equity is critically important, especially when firms are selling multiple products and brands in multiple markets. Here, brand hierarchies must define common and distinct brand elements among various nested products. New product and brand extension strategies also must ensure that we have optimal brand and product portfolios. Finally, we need to manage these brands and products effectively over geographic boundaries and target market segments by creating brand awareness and a positive brand image in each market in which the brand is sold.  
We need a long-term view of brand equity because changes in current marketing programs and activities and in the marketing environment can affect consumers’ brand knowledge structures and thus their response to future marketing programs and activities. Managing brands over time requires reinforcing the brand meaning and adjusting the branding program as needed. For brands whose equity has eroded over time, we rely on a number of revitalization strategies.  
Figures 15-6 and 15-7 highlight some important guidelines for managing brand equity.

**Themes.** The dominant themes in managing brand equity are the importance of maintaining balance in marketing activities and of making moderate levels of change in the marketing program over time. Without some modifications of the marketing program, a brand runs the risk of becoming obsolete or irrelevant to consumers. At the same time, dramatic shifts back and forth in brand strategies can confuse or alienate consumers. Thus, a consistent thread of meaning—which consumers can recognize—should run through the marketing program and reflect the key sources of equity for the brand and its core brand associations.
