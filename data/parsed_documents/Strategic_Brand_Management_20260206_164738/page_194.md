# Setting Prices to Build Brand Equity

Choosing a pricing strategy to build brand equity means determining the following:

* A method for setting current prices  
* A policy for choosing the depth and duration of promotions and discounts

There are many different approaches to setting prices, and the choice depends on a number of considerations. This section highlights a few of the most important issues as they relate to brand equity.<sup>47</sup>

Factors related to the costs of making and selling products and the relative prices of competitive products are important determinants in pricing strategy. Increasingly, however, firms are placing greater importance on consumer perceptions and preferences. Many firms now are employing a value-pricing approach to setting prices and an everyday-low-pricing (EDLP) approach to determining their discount pricing policy over time. Let’s look at both.

## Value Pricing.

The objective of *value pricing* is to uncover the right blend of product quality, product costs, and product prices that fully satisfies the needs and wants of consumers and the profit targets of the firm. Marketers have employed value pricing in various ways for years, sometimes learning the hard way that consumers will not pay price premiums that exceed their perceptions of the value of a brand. Perhaps the most vivid illustration was the legendary price cut for Philip Morris’s leading cigarette brand, Marlboro, described in Branding Brief 5-1.<sup>48</sup>

### BRANDING BRIEF 5-1

## Marlboro’s Price Drop

On April 2, 1993, or “Marlboro Friday,” Philip Morris dropped a bombshell in the form of a three-page announcement: “Philip Morris USA . . . announced a major shift in business strategy designed to increase market share and grow long-term profitability in a highly price sensitive market environment.” Quoting tobacco unit president and CEO William I. Campbell, the statement continued, “We have determined that in the current market environment caused by prolonged economic softness and depressed consumer confidence, we should take those steps necessary to grow our market share rather than pursue rapid income growth rates that might erode our leading marketplace position.”

Philip Morris announced four major steps, the fourth of which caught the eye of marketers and Wall Street alike: a major promotional cut in the price of Marlboro (roughly 40 to 50 cents a pack), which was expected to decrease earnings in Philip Morris’s most profitable unit by 40 percent. The action was justified by the results of a month-long test in Portland, Oregon, the previous December in which a 40-cent decrease in pack price had increased market share by 4 points.

The stock market reaction to the announcement was swift. By day’s end, Philip Morris’s stock price had declined from $64.12 to $49.37, a 23 percent drop that represented a one-day loss of $13 billion in shareholder equity! There was a ripple effect in the stock market, with significant stock price declines for other consumer goods companies with major brands like Sara Lee, Kellogg’s, General Mills, and Procter & Gamble. A company that took one of the biggest hits was Coca-Cola, whose shareholders lost $5 billion in paper earnings in the days following “Black Friday.”

A number of factors probably led Marlboro to cut prices so dramatically. The economy certainly was still sluggish, coming out of a recession. Private-label or store-brand cigarettes had been increasing in quality and were receiving more attention from customers and retailers. A prime consideration suggested by many was related to Philip Morris’s hefty price increases. These had often occurred two to three times a year, so that the retail price of a pack of Marlboros more than tripled between 1980 and 1992. The 80 cents to $1 difference between premium brands and discount brands that prevailed at that time was thought to have resulted in steady sales increases for the discount brands at the expense of Marlboro’s market share, which had dropped to 22 percent and was projected to decline further to 18 percent if Philip Morris made no changes.

Although much of the popular press attempted to exploit Marlboro’s actions to proclaim that “brands were dead,” nothing could have been further from the truth. In fact, a more accurate interpretation of the whole episode is that it showed that new brands were entering the scene, as evidenced by the ability of discount brands to create their own brand equity on the basis of strong consumer associations to “value.”

At the same time, existing brands, if properly managed, can command loyalty, enjoy price premiums, and still be extremely profitable. By cutting the difference between discount cigarettes and Marlboro to roughly 40 cents, Philip Morris was able to woo back many customers. Within nine months after the price drop, its market share increased to almost 27 percent. Years later, Marlboro currently owns 42 percent of the market. Priced at $5.70 a pack, the brand commands a significant premium over the average $4.21 price for the cheapest brands on the market.
