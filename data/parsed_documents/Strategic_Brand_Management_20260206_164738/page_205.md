Two important components of partnership strategies are retail segmentation activities and cooperative advertising programs.

### Retail Segmentation.

Retailers are “customers” too. Because of their different marketing capabilities and needs, retailers may need to be divided into segments or even treated individually so they will provide the necessary brand support.⁷⁷ Consider how the following packaged goods companies have customized their marketing efforts to particular retailers:⁷⁸

* Frito-Lay developed a tailored supply-chain system for its corn chip and potato chip markets, making fast and broad distribution possible, reducing stock-outs, and creating better-turning store displays for its various retail customers.
* SC Johnson has leveraged customized market research insights to develop unique category management solutions to its strategic retail customers.
* Scotts Miracle-Gro customizes its product lines, marketing events, and supply chain for “big box,” club, and hardware co-op channels.

Different retailers may need different product mixes, special delivery systems, customized promotions, or even their own branded version of the products.

*Branded variants* have been defined as branded items in a diverse set of durable and semi-durable goods categories that are not directly comparable to other items carrying the same brand name.⁷⁹ Manufacturers create branded variants in many ways, including making changes in color, design, flavor, options, style, stain, motif, features, and layout. For example, portable stereo “boom boxes” from brands like Sony, Panasonic, and Toshiba come in a broad assortment of variants, varying in speaker size, total weight, number of audio controls, recording features, and SKU number.

Branded variants are a means to reduce retail price competition because they make direct price comparisons by consumers difficult. Thus, different retailers may be given different items or models of the same brand to sell. Shugan and his colleagues show that as the manufacturer of a product offers more branded variants, a greater number of retail stores carry the product, and these stores offer higher levels of retail service for these products.⁸⁰

### Cooperative Advertising.

One relatively neglected means of increasing channel support is well-designed cooperative advertising programs. Traditionally, with co-op advertising, a manufacturer pays for a portion of the advertising that a retailer runs to promote the manufacturer’s product and its availability in the retailer’s place of business. To be eligible to receive co-op funds, the retailer usually must follow the manufacturer’s stipulations as to the nature of brand exposure in the ad. Manufacturers generally share the cost of the advertising on a percentage basis up to a certain limit but usually 50–50. The total amount of cooperative advertising funds the manufacturer provides to the retailer is usually based on a percentage of dollar purchases made by the retailer from the manufacturer.⁸¹

The rationale behind cooperative advertising for manufacturers is that it concentrates some of the communication efforts at a local level where they may have more relevance and selling impact with consumers. Unfortunately, the brand image communicated through co-op ads is not as tightly controlled as when the manufacturer runs its own ads, and there is a danger that the emphasis in a co-op ad may be on the store or on a particular sale it is running rather than on the brand. Perhaps even worse, there is also a danger that a co-op ad may communicate a message about the brand that runs counter to its desired image.

An ideal situation is to achieve synergy between the manufacturer’s own ad campaigns for a brand and its corresponding co-op ad campaigns with retailers. The challenge in designing effective co-op ads will continue to be striking a balance between pushing the brand and the store at the same time. In that sense, cooperative advertising will have to live up to its name, and manufacturers will have to get involved in the design and execution of retailers’ campaigns rather than just handing over money or supplying generic, uninspired ads.

### Summary.

In eliciting channel support, manufacturers must be creative in the way they develop marketing and merchandising programs aimed at the trade or any other channel members.
