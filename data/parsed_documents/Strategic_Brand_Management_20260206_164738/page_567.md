# 6. Take a Big Picture View of Branding Effects. Know What Is Working (and Why)

### *Justifying Brand Investments.*  
One challenge in achieving brand accountability is that brand marketing activities are intended to have long-term, broad, and varied effects. Any particular marketing activity may increase the breadth or depth of brand awareness; establish or strengthen performance-related or imagery-related brand associations; elicit positive judgments or feelings; create stronger ties or bonds with the brand; initiate brand-related actions such as search, word-of-mouth, and purchase; or many or even all the above. And its effects may be enduring as well as short-term.

Marketers must adopt comprehensive, cohesive, and actionable models to help them develop ROI insights and interpretations. As an example, three linked, interlocking models in Chapters 2 and 3 that marketers can use in brand planning, tracking, and measurement are:

1. The *brand positioning model* describes how to establish competitive advantages via points-of-difference (associations unique to the brand that are also strongly held and favorably evaluated by consumers) and points-of-parity (associations shared with other brands that are designed to negate competitors’ points-of-difference, overcome perceived vulnerabilities of the brand, or establish category credentials).

2. The *brand resonance model* considers how intense, active loyalty relationships are created with customers. The basic premise is that building a strong brand requires a series of steps as part of a “branding ladder” and a set of logically constructed “brand building blocks.” Brand resonance occurs when consumers feels completely “in synch” with the brand. The second level of the model is where the output from the brand positioning model appears, in terms of which points-of-parity and points-of-difference are to be created with which performance and/or imagery associations.

3. The *brand value chain model* describes how to trace the value creation process to better understand the financial impact of marketing expenditures and investments. The model examines four different stages in the value creation process for a brand. It considers how marketing activities affect the customer mind-set—as measured by all the building blocks in the brand resonance model—which, in turn, creates various marketplace outcomes and ultimately shareholder value.

The specific components of these three models are not as important as their purpose and scope. The models can both assist planning and measurement, and they can capture a full range of marketing activities for any type of brand. In particular, by tracing the effects of marketing activities through the customer mind-set, and on to various marketplace outcomes such as price premiums, loyalty, sales, market share and profitability, marketers can gain a clearer picture of how well their marketing is doing and why.

### *Achieving Deeper Brand Understanding.*  
Branding is clearly a complex marketing endeavor. To better grasp all its dimensions, we adopt a multidisciplinary view to interpret branding effects and more completely understand brands, the value they have created, and how they should be managed as a result. We can develop marketing guidelines for branding from a variety of different perspectives, including economic, psychological, and sociological.

Fundamentally, marketing should help create or enhance the equity and value of a brand to all its various constituents. The stronger the brand, the more power brand marketers have with distributors and retailers, and the easier it is to implement marketplace programs to capitalize on brand equity. Extracting proper price premiums that reflect the value of the brand—and not over- or underpricing—is one of the most critical financial considerations for branding.

## Finding the Branding Sweet Spot  
Given their substantial intangible value, brands are likely to remain a top priority for organizations. The branding area continues to receive intense research attention, as researchers tackle old problems and address new challenges in important ways. Successful branding in the twenty-first century requires new areas of emphasis and new skills as described in the preceding six imperatives. We conclude by discussing one broad theme that cuts across all six: achieving balance in managing brands by finding the branding “sweet spot.” To find the branding sweet spot, managers must reconcile trade-offs in brand management and strike the balance between simplicity and complexity in all brand decision-making and activity.
