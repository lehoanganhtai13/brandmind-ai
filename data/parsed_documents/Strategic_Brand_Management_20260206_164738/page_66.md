26. University professors are certainly aware of the power of the name as a brand. In fact, one reason many professors choose to have students identify themselves on exams by numbers of some type instead of by name is so they will not be biased in grading by their knowledge of which student’s exam they are reading. Otherwise, it may be too easy to give higher grades to those students the professor likes or, for whatever reason, expects to have done well on the exam.
