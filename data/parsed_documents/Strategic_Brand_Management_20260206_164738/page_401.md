The cost of introducing a related new product can be lower and the likelihood of acceptance higher when marketers apply an existing family brand to a new product.

On the other hand, if the products linked to the family brand and their supporting marketing programs are not carefully considered and designed, the associations to the family brand may become weaker and less favorable. Moreover, the failure of one product may hurt other products sold under the same brand.

### Individual Brand Level.

Individual brands are restricted to essentially one product category, although multiple product types may differ on the basis of model, package size, flavor, and so forth. For example, in the “salty snack” product class, Frito-Lay offers Fritos corn chips, Doritos tortilla chips, Lays and Ruffles potato chips, and Rold Gold pretzels. Each brand has a dominant position in its respective product category within the broader salty snack product class.

The main advantage of creating individual brands is that we can customize the brand and all its supporting marketing activity to meet the needs of a specific customer group. Thus, the name, logo, and other brand elements, as well as product design, marketing communication programs, and pricing and distribution strategies, can all focus on a certain target market. Moreover, if the brand runs into difficulty or fails, the risk to other brands and the company itself is minimal. The disadvantages of creating individual brands, however, are the difficulty, complexity, and expense of developing separate marketing programs to build sufficient levels of brand equity.

### Modifier Level.

Regardless of whether marketers choose corporate, family, or individual brands, they must often further distinguish brands according to the different types of items or models. A *modifier* is a means to designate a specific item or model type or a particular version or configuration of the product. Land O’Lakes offers “whipped,” “unsalted,” and “regular” versions of its butter. Yoplait yogurt comes as “light,” “custard style,” and “original” flavors.

Adding a modifier often can signal refinements or differences between brands related to factors such as quality levels (Johnnie Walker Red Label, Black Label, and Gold Label Scotch whiskey), attributes (Wrigley’s Spearmint, Doublemint, Juicy Fruit, and Winterfresh flavors of chewing gum), function (Dockers Relaxed Fit, Classic Fit, Straight Fit, Slim Fit, and Extra Slim Fit pants), and so forth.<sup>16</sup> Thus, one function of modifiers is to show how one brand variation relates to others in the same brand family.

Modifiers help make products more understandable and relevant to consumers or even to the trade. They can even become strong trademarks if they are able to develop a unique association with the parent brand—only Uncle Ben has “Converted Rice,” and only Orville Redenbacher sells “Gourmet Popping Corn.”<sup>17</sup>

### Product Descriptor.

Although not considered a brand element per se, the product descriptor for the branded product may be an important ingredient of branding strategy. The product descriptor helps consumers understand what the product is and does and also helps define the relevant competition in consumers’ minds.

In some cases, it may be hard to describe succinctly what the product is, a new product with unusual functions or even an existing product that has dramatically changed. Public libraries are no longer about checking out books or taking a preschooler to story time. A full-service modern public library serves as an educational, cultural, social, and recreational community center.

In the case of a truly new product, introducing it with a familiar product name may facilitate basic familiarity and comprehension, but perhaps at the expense of a richer understanding of how the new product is different from closely related products that already exist.

### Designing a Brand Hierarchy

Given the different possible levels of a brand hierarchy, a firm has a number of branding options available, depending on whether and how it employs each level. Designing the right brand hierarchy is crucial. Branding Brief 11-2 describes the firestorm Netflix encountered when it attempted to make a significant change to its brand hierarchy.
