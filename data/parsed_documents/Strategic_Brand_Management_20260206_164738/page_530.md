Different income segments exist in developing markets. Although many marketers have successfully tapped into the high end of the income spectrum with luxury goods or by focusing on the growing middle class, opportunities also abound at the broader base of the income pyramid.

# BUILDING GLOBAL CUSTOMER-BASED BRAND EQUITY

In designing and implementing a global brand marketing program, marketers want to realize the advantages while suffering as few of the disadvantages as possible.

The first—and most fundamental—guideline is to recognize that international markets can vary in terms of brand development, consumer behavior, marketing infrastructure, competitive activity, legal restrictions, and so on. Virtually every top global brand and company adjusts its marketing program in some way across some markets but holds the parameters fixed in other markets.

Key operational aspects include establishing robust marketing infrastructure and adopting integrated marketing communications. The principles also highlight the importance of collaboration through brand partnerships and the critical need to balance global consistency with local adaptation, both in terms of marketing strategies and organizational control. Finally, the commandments stress the establishment of clear operational guidelines, the implementation of systems to measure brand equity, and the effective utilization of brand elements to achieve global success. Unilever launched the fabric-softener product in Germany in 1970 as an economy brand in a category dominated by Procter & Gamble.
