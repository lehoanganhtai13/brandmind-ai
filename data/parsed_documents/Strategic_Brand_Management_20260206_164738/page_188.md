Experiential marketing, on the  
other hand, would seem to be particularly effective at establishing brand imagery and tapping  
into a variety of different feelings as well as helping build brand communities. Despite poten-  
tially different areas of emphasis, all four approaches can build stronger consumer–brand bonds.  
One implication of these new approaches is that the traditional “marketing mix” concept and  
the notion of the “4 Ps” of marketing—product, price, place (or distribution), and promotion (or  
marketing communications)—may not fully describe modern marketing programs, or the many  
activities, such as loyalty programs or pop-up stores, that may not necessarily fit neatly into one  
of those designations. Nevertheless, firms still have to make decisions about what exactly they are  
going to sell, how (and where) they are going to sell it, and at what price. In other words, firms  
must still devise product, pricing, and distribution strategies as part of their marketing programs.  
The specifics of how they set those strategies, however, have changed considerably. We turn  
next to these topics and highlight a key development in each area, recognizing that there are  
many other important areas beyond the scope of this text. With product strategy, we emphasize  
the role of extrinsic factors; with pricing strategy, we focus on value pricing; and with channel  
strategy, we concentrate on channel integration.  

# PRODUCT STRATEGY  
The product itself is the primary influence on what consumers experience with a brand, what  
they hear about a brand from others, and what the firm can tell customers about the brand. At the  
heart of a great brand is invariably a great product.  
Designing and delivering a product or service that fully satisfies consumer needs and wants  
is a prerequisite for successful marketing, regardless of whether the product is a tangible good,  
service, or organization. For brand loyalty to exist, consumers’ experiences with the product  
must at least meet, if not actually surpass, their expectations.  
After considering how consumers form their opinions of the quality and value of a product,  
we consider how marketers can go beyond the actual product to enhance product experiences  
and add additional value before, during, and after product use.  

## Perceived Quality  
**Perceived quality** is customers’ perception of the overall quality or superiority of a product or  
service compared to alternatives and with respect to its intended purpose. Achieving a satisfac-  
tory level of perceived quality has become more difficult as continual product improvements  
over the years have led to heightened consumer expectations.<sup>26</sup>  
Much research has tried to understand how consumers form their opinions about quality.  
The specific attributes of product quality can vary from category to category. Nevertheless, con-  
sistent with the brand resonance model from Chapter 3, research has identified the following  
general dimensions: primary ingredients and supplementary features; product reliability, dura-  
bility and serviceability; and style and design.<sup>27</sup> Consumer beliefs about these characteristics  
often define quality and, in turn, influence attitudes and behavior toward a brand.  
Product quality depends not only on functional product performance but on broader perfor-  
mance considerations as well, like speed, accuracy, and care of product delivery and installation;  
the promptness, courtesy, and helpfulness of customer service and training; and the quality of  
repair service.  
Brand attitudes may also depend on more abstract product imagery, such as the symbolism  
or personality reflected in the brand. These “augmented” aspects of a product are often crucial  
to its equity. Finally, consumer evaluations may not correspond to the perceived quality of the  
product and may be formed by less thoughtful decision making, such as simple heuristics and  
decision rules based on brand reputation or product characteristics such as color or scent.  

## Aftermarketing  
To achieve the desired brand image, product strategies should focus on both purchase *and* con-  
sumption. Much marketing activity is devoted to finding ways to encourage trial and repeat  
purchases by consumers. Perhaps the strongest and potentially most favorable associations, how-  
ever, result from actual product experience—what Procter & Gamble calls the “second moment  
of truth” (the “first moment of truth” occurs at purchase).
