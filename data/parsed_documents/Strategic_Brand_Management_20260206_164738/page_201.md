*Catalog retailers:* Nike’s products appear in numerous shoe, sporting goods, and clothing catalogs.  
*Specialty stores:* Nike equipment from product lines such as Nike Golf is often sold through specialty stores such as golf pro shops.

Much research has considered the pros and cons of selling through various channels. Although the decision ultimately depends on the relative profitability of the different options, some more specific guidelines have been proposed. For example, one study for industrial products suggests that direct channels may be preferable when product information needs are high, product customization is high, product quality assurance is important, purchase lot size is important, and logistics are important. On the other hand, this study also suggests that indirect channels may be preferable when a broad assortment is essential, availability is critical, and after-sales service is important. Exceptions to these generalities exist, especially depending on the market segments.  
From the viewpoint of consumer shopping and purchase behaviors, we can see channels as blending three key factors: information, entertainment, and experiences.

* Consumers may learn about a brand and what it does and why it is different or special.  
* Consumers may also be entertained by the means by which the channel permits shopping and purchases.  
* Consumers may be able to participate in and experience channel activities.

It is rare that a manufacturer will use only a single type of channel. More likely, the firm will choose a hybrid channel design with multiple channel types. Marketers must manage these channels carefully, as Tupperware found out.

### TUPPERWARE

In the 1950s, Tupperware pioneered the plastic food-storage container business and the means by which the containers were sold. With many mothers staying at home and growth in the suburbs exploding, Tupperware parties with a local neighborhood host became a successful avenue for selling. Unfortunately, with more women entering the workforce and heightened competition from brands such as Rubbermaid, Tupperware sales closed out the twentieth century with a 15-year decline. Sales turned around only with some new approaches to selling, including booths at shopping malls and a move to the Internet. The decision to place products in all 1,148 Target stores, however, was a complete disaster. In-store selling was difficult given the very different retail environment. Moreover, because the product was made more widely available, interest in traditional in-home parties plummeted. Frustrated, many salespeople dropped out and fewer new ones were recruited. Although the products were yanked from the stores, the damage was done and profit plunged almost 50 percent. As one key distributor commented, “We just bit off more than we could chew.” Tupperware made a serious mistake revising its channel strategy to sell through Target.
