The company found it hard to actually implement such a formal rating, however, and later announced it was committed only to providing more product information to consumers.<sup>78</sup>

The challenge is that producing and consuming products always requires trade-offs—all products, regardless of how “green” they appear or claim to be, affect the environment in some way. To understand the full environmental impact of any one product, we need to understand the entire production and consumption process, from raw material inputs to ultimate disposal.

And the results of “green” actions are not always obvious. Gary Hirshberg, founder and CEO of Stonyfield Farm, notes that although many see the use of recyclable packaging as environmentally friendly, Stonyfield further reduced its carbon footprint by switching to yogurt cups that were *not* recyclable, and meant to be thrown away. These cups, made from plants that are disposed into landfills, generate far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than recycled plastic containers.

Similarly, when Patagonia examined the environmental impact of the fibers in its outdoor apparel lines, it found the most harmful one was cotton—not petroleum-based synthetics—because growing cotton requires the use of pesticides. The company switched to organic cotton, but that has its own drawbacks because it uses so much water. Manufacturing a single pair of jeans can require 1,200 gallons of water!<sup>79</sup>

Deciphering environmental claims is thus very tricky. To help provide some clarity, the U.S. government has stepped in and demanded that companies be more specific and substantiate environmental claims. A “recycled” claim must specify how much of the product or package is recycled and whether it is “postconsumer” (previously used goods) or “preconsumer” (manufacturing waste). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is leading the charge, cracking down on vague, unsubstantiated claims by requiring independent product testing. For example, firms cannot use the government’s Energy Star logo on their products unless third-party testing proves they are more efficient than comparable regular products.<sup>80</sup>

**Consumer Behavior.** Like many well-publicized social trends, corporate environmental awareness is often fairly complex in reality and does not always fully match public perceptions. Several studies help put consumer attitudes toward the environment in perspective.

Although consumers often assert that they would like to support environmentally friendly products, their behavior doesn’t always match their intentions.<sup>81</sup> In most segments, they appear unwilling to give up the benefits of other options to choose green products. For example, some consumers dislike the performance, appearance, or texture of recycled paper and household products. Others are unwilling to give up the convenience of disposable products like diapers.

**Poor Implementation.** In jumping on the green marketing bandwagon, many firms initially did a poor job. Products were poorly designed, overpriced, and inappropriately promoted. Once product quality improved, advertising sometimes still missed the mark, being overly aggressive or not compelling. One research study found that assertive environmental messages were most effective for important environmental causes; otherwise, a softer touch was more beneficial.<sup>82</sup>

**Possible Solutions.** The environmental movement in Europe and Japan has a longer history and firmer footing than in the United States. In Europe, many of Procter & Gamble’s basic household items, including cleaners and detergents, are available in refills that come in throw-away pouches. P&G says U.S. customers probably would not take to the pouches. In the United States, firms continue to strive to meet the wishes of consumers concerning the environmental benefits of their products, while maintaining necessary profitability.
