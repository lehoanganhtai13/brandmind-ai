The risk in designing a hybrid channel system is having too many channels (leading to conflict among channel members or a lack of support), or too few channels (resulting in market opportunities being overlooked). The goal is to maximize channel coverage and effectiveness while minimizing channel cost and conflict.

Because marketers use both direct and indirect channels, let’s consider the brand equity implications of the two major channel design types.

### Indirect Channels

Indirect channels can consist of a number of different types of intermediaries, but we will concentrate on retailers. Retailers tend to have the most visible and direct contact with customers and therefore have the greatest opportunity to affect brand equity. As we will outline in greater detail in Chapter 7, consumers may have associations to any one retailer on the basis of product assortment, pricing and credit policy, and quality of service, among other factors. Through the products and brands they stock and the means by which they sell, retailers strive to create their own brand equity by establishing awareness and strong, favorable, and unique associations.

At the same time, retailers can have a profound influence on the equity of the brands they sell, especially in terms of the brand-related services they can support or help create. Moreover, the interplay between a store’s image and the brand images of the products it sells is an important one. Consumers make assumptions such as “this store only sells good-quality, high-value merchandise, so this particular product must also be good quality and high value.”

Besides the indirect avenue of image transfer, retailers can directly affect the equity of the brands they sell. Their methods of stocking, displaying, and selling products can enhance or detract from brand equity, suggesting that manufacturers must take an active role in helping retailers add value to their brands. A topic of great interest in recent years in that regard is shopper marketing.

Though defined differently by different people, at its core *shopper marketing* emphasizes collaboration between manufacturers and retailers on in-store marketing like brand-building displays, sampling promotions, and other in-store activities designed to capitalize on a retailer’s capabilities and its customers. Vlasic is a brand that has ramped up its shopper marketing program.

### VLASIC

Although many homes keep a jar of pickles in their refrigerator, too often it ends up in the back of a shelf, where it is forgotten. When summer barbecue season rolls along, pickle consumption increases, although still not as much as market leader Vlasic would like. Company research revealed that about 80 percent of pickles consumed in U.S.
