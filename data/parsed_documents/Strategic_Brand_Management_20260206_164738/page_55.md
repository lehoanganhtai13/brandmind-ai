## CONVERSE

CMO Geoff Cottrill maintains that an important priority at Converse is “to shut up and listen.” With a small budget, marketing for the brand has focused on digital and social media. The Web site is chock full of consumer-generated content. On Facebook, the brand went from 6 to 9 million fans as consumers chose to take pictures of their shoes, draw on them, and post about them. Cottrill notes that although there are places where the company tells stories about its shoes—in stores and on the Web site—“for the most part we let the conversation go … it’s those creative people that are really pushing the brand.” The brand has also functioned as a curator of sorts for new music, art, and entertainment. Converse has built a studio called Rubber Tracks in New York City to support new, emerging bands by allowing them to record there for free.

## Economic Downturns

A severe recession that commenced in 2008 threatened the fortunes of many brands. One research study of consumers at the end of 2009 found the following sobering facts:

* 18 percent of consumers reported that they had bought lower-priced brands of consumer packaged goods in the past two years.
* 46 percent of the switchers to less expensive products said “they found better performance than they expected,” with the vast majority saying performance was actually *much* better than expected.
* 34 percent of the switchers said “they no longer preferred higher-priced products.”

As the economy appeared to move out of the recession, the question was whether attitudes and behaviors that did change would revert back to their pre-recession norms. Regardless, there will always be economic cycles and ups and downs, and *The Science of Branding* 1-4 offers some guidelines for marketing brands during economic downturns.

## Brand Proliferation

Another important change in the branding environment is the proliferation of new brands and products, in part spurred by the rise in line and brand extensions. As a result, a brand name may now be identified with a number of different products with varying degrees of similarity. Marketers of brands such as Coke, Nivea, Dove, and Virgin have added a host of new products under their brand umbrellas in recent years. There are few single (or “mono”) product brands around, which complicates the decisions that marketers have to make.
