Figure 9-5 offers advice from one expert on the subject, Ed McQuarrie, about best practices for an outbound or inbound customer visit.  
Service companies often employ *mystery shoppers*, paid researchers who pose as customers to learn about the service experience provided by a company. Sometimes the results can be eye-opening. When the president of Office Depot decided to pose as a mystery shopper himself, he found that employees were spending too much time keeping stores clean and well-stocked and not enough time actually building relationships with customers. As a result, the company reduced the size of stores, retrained and incentivized employees to focus more on customers, and added other products and services that customers wanted that were not currently available.  

Through the years, companies have changed the way they gain customer insights. Microsoft employs ethnographic research with in-depth studies of consumer online search attitudes and behavior. Observing consumers inside and outside the home in a series of research studies, the company learned of changes over time in the way consumers explore and learn about new things online.  

* An initial study in 2004 revealed that consumers were just trying to find out what experts say, because they felt that experts “knew it all.”  
* A follow-up study in 2007 showed that consumers believed all the information they needed to learn was actually available through search engines—they just needed to figure out how to use the search engines.  
* By 2010, however, ethnographic research showed that people felt they actually created their own knowledge. Search engines were just enablers.  

Of special research importance to many companies are lead or leading users. Many firms ask online groups of their most progressive consumers to give feedback via instant-messages or chat rooms. PepsiCo’s DEWmocracy 2 program, launched in July 2009, was a 12-month, seven-stage campaign to create another consumer-generated version of its Mountain Dew soft drink, as had happened when the first DEWmocracy produced the highly successful Mountain Dew Voltage. The new campaign tapped into DEW labs, the brand’s private online community of its most loyal customers, but also Facebook, Twitter, USTREAM, a 12-second TV video contest, and a dedicated YouTube channel. Another company with close ties to leading-edge users is Burton Snowboards.
