In each case, consumers inferred a concrete attribute association for an extension that was technically feasible, even though common sense might have suggested that, logically, a manufacturer would not likely introduce a product with such an attribute.

More abstract associations, on the other hand, may be more relevant across a wide set of categories because of their intangible nature. For example, Aaker and Keller also showed that the Vuarnet brand had a remarkable ability to transfer to a disparate set of product categories, such as sportswear, watches, wallets, and even skis. In these cases, complementarity may have led consumers to infer that the extension would have the “stylish” attribute associated with the Vuarnet name, and they valued such an association in the different contexts.

We should note several caveats, however. First, parent brands’ concrete attributes *can* transfer to some product categories. [83] A concrete attribute that is highly valued in the extension category because it creates a distinctive taste, ingredient, or component can often make the extension successful. According to Farquhar and Herr, such extensions might include Tylenol sinus medication, Oreo cookies and cream ice cream, and Arm & Hammer carpet deodorizer. [84]

Second, abstract associations may not always transfer easily. This second caveat emerged from a study conducted by Bridges, Keller, and Sood, who examined the relative transferability of product-related brand information when it was represented either as an abstract brand association or as a concrete brand association. For example, one such comparison contrasted the relative transferability of a watch brand characterized by dominant concrete attribute associations such as “water-resistant quartz movements, a time-keeping mechanism encased in shockproof steel covers, and shatterproof crystal,” with that of a brand characterized by dominant abstract attribute associations such as “durable.”

Although these authors expected the abstract brand representation to fare better, they found that, for several reasons, the two types of brand images extended equally well into a dissimilar product category—handbags. Perhaps the most important reason was that consumers did not believe the abstract benefit would have the same meaning in the extension category (durability does not necessarily “transfer” because durability for a watch is not the same as durability for a handbag). [85]

Finally, Joiner and Loken, in a demonstration of the “inclusion effect” in a brand extension setting, showed that consumers often generalized possession of an attribute from a specific category (like Sony televisions) to a more general category (say, all Sony products) more readily than they generalized the attribute from the specific category (Sony televisions) to another specific category (Sony bicycles). The effect was greater the more the specific extension category was typical of the general category (Sony cameras are more typical than Sony bicycles). [86]

7. **Consumers may transfer associations that are positive in the original product class but become negative in the extension context.** Because they have different motivations or use the product differently in the extension category, consumers may not value a brand association as highly as the original product. For example, when Campbell test-marketed a tomato sauce with the Campbell’s name, it flopped. Apparently, Campbell’s strong associations to soup signaled to consumers that the new product would be watery. To give the product more credibility, Campbell changed the name to the Italian-sounding “Prego,” and the product has gone on to be a long-term success.

8. **Consumers may infer negative associations about an extension, perhaps even based on other inferred positive associations.** Even if consumers transfer positive associations from the parent brand to the extension, they may still infer other negative associations. For example, the Bridges, Keller, and Sood study showed that consumers who thought a proposed handbag extension from a hypothetical maker of durable watches also would be durable also assumed it would not be fashionable, helping to contribute to low extension evaluations.
