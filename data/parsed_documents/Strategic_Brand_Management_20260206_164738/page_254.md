This figure illustrates the hierarchical structure of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, also known as the TCP/IP model. It presents a layered architecture, beginning with the Application Layer at the top, responsible for user-facing services like HTTP and FTP. Below this is the Transport Layer, which handles end-to-end communication and reliability, featuring protocols such as TCP and UDP. The Internet Layer (or Network Layer) manages logical addressing and routing, with the core protocol being IP. Finally, the Network Interface Layer (or Link Layer) deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium, encompassing protocols like Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Data flows down this stack for transmission and up the stack for reception, with each layer encapsulating data from the layer above and de-encapsulating data from the layer below.

Communication option can be judged in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency by which it affects brand awareness and by which it creates, maintains, or strengthens favorable and unique brand associations. Different communication options have different strengths and can accomplish different objectives. Thus, it is important to employ a mix of different communication options, each playing a specific role in building or maintaining brand equity.

The second important insight that emerges from the conceptual framework is that the marketing communication program should be put together in a way such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, as much as possible, there should be a match among certain communication options so that the effects of any one communication option are enhanced by the presence of another option.

In closing, the basic message of this chapter is simple: marketers need to evaluate marketing communication options strategically to determine how they can contribute to brand equity. To do so, marketers need some theoretical and managerial guidelines by which they can determine the effectiveness and efficiency of various communication options both singularly and in combination with other communication options. Figure 6-7 provides the author’s philosophy concerning the design, implementation, and interpretation of marketing communication strategies.

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Pick a brand and gather all its marketing communication materials. How effectively has the brand mixed and matched marketing communications? Has it capitalized on the strengths of different media and compensated for their weaknesses at the same time? How explicitly has it integrated its communication program?  
2. What do you see as the role of the Internet in building brands? How would you evaluate the Web site for a major brand—for example, Nike, Disney, or Levi’s? How about one of your favorite brands?  
3. Pick up a current issue of a popular magazine. Which print ad do you feel is the best, and which ad do you feel is the worst based on the criteria described in this chapter?  
4. Look at the coupon supplements in a Sunday newspaper. How are they building brand equity, if at all? Try to find a good example and a poor example of brand-building promotions.  
5. Choose a popular event. Who sponsors it? How are they building brand equity with their sponsorship? Are they integrating the sponsorship with other marketing communications?
