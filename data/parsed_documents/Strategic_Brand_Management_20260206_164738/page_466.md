*It can be difficult to extend into a product class that consumers see as easy to make.*  
Consumers may dismiss some seemingly appropriate extensions if they see the product as comparatively easy to make and brand differences are hard to come by. Then a high-quality brand may seem incongruous; alternatively, consumers may feel the extension will attempt to command an unreasonable price premium and be too expensive.  
For example, Aaker and Keller showed that hypothetical extensions such as Heineken popcorn, Vidal Sassoon perfume, Crest shaving cream, and Häagen-Dazs cottage cheese received relatively poor marks from experimental subjects in part because all brands in the extension category were seen as being about the same in quality, suggesting that the proposed brand extension was unlikely to be superior to existing products.  
When consumers see the extension category as difficult to make, on the other hand, such that brands can vary a great deal in quality, an extension has a greater opportunity to differentiate itself, although consumers may also be less sure what the exact quality level of the extension will be.<sup>88</sup>

10. **A successful extension can not only contribute to the parent brand image but also enable a brand to extend even farther.**  
An extension can help the image of the parent brand by improving the strength, favorability, or uniqueness of its associations.<sup>89</sup> For example, Keller and Aaker, as well as Swaminathan, Fox, and Reddy, showed that when consumers did not already have strongly held attitudes, the successful introduction of a brand extension improved their choice and evaluations of a parent brand they originally perceived to be of only average quality.  
If an extension changes the image and meaning of the brand, subsequent extensions that otherwise might not have seemed appropriate to consumers may make more sense and appear to be a better fit. Keller and Aaker showed that by taking little steps, that is, by introducing a series of closely related but increasingly distant extensions, marketers may insert brands into product categories that would have been much more difficult, or perhaps even impossible, to enter directly.<sup>90</sup>  
A successful extension thus helps brands grow in three important ways:  
1. By establishing a new market for the brand,  
2. By strengthening existing markets for the brand, and  
3. By opening up the possibility of additional new markets for the brand to subsequently enter.  

For example, when Toyota launched the successful Prius hybrid gasoline–electric car, it not only cast a positive halo on the Toyota corporate brand as a whole as innovative and environmentally concerned, but it also paved the way for the introduction of a whole family of four different Prius models.  
Similarly, when Apple introduced the iPod and iTunes digital music systems, they quickly became the market leader, representing one of the company’s most successful new products ever. It also provided a halo effect that significantly boosted sales for the company’s existing computer and software products. Finally, it made it easier for the company to introduce the iPhone smartphone and perhaps even the iPad tablet computer.  

Different factors affect the success of multiple extensions. Boush and Loken found that consumers evaluated far extensions from a “broad” brand more favorably than from a “narrow” brand.<sup>91</sup> Dacin and Smith have shown that if the perceived quality levels of different members of a brand portfolio are more uniform, then consumers tend to make higher, more confident evaluations of a proposed new extension.<sup>92</sup> They also showed that a firm that had demonstrated little variance in quality across a diverse set of product categories was better able to overcome perceptions of poor extension fit. It is as if consumers in this case think, “Whatever this company does, it tends to do well.”  
In an empirical study of 95 brands in 11 nondurable consumer goods categories, Sullivan found that, in terms of stages of the product category life cycle, early-entering brand extensions did not perform as well, on average, as either early-entering new-name products or late-entering brand extensions.<sup>93</sup>
