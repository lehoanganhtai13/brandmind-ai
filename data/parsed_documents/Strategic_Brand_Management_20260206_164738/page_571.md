Figure 15-13 outlines additional branding guidelines for high-tech products, emphasizing strategies to navigate short product life cycles. Key recommendations include establishing strong brand awareness and a rich brand image, moving beyond product specifications alone to drive sales, and leveraging non-product associations for differentiation. It's crucial to create corporate credibility associations, building trust and perceived expertise due to rapid product turnover and complexity, with the CEO often playing a significant brand-building role. Secondary associations, such as third-party endorsements, are vital for communicating quality when consumers struggle to assess it directly. Conversely, firms should avoid "overbranding" by limiting ingredient and endorser brands to prevent consumer confusion. Finally, the guidelines advocate for selectively introducing new products as new brands or clearly identified brand extensions, utilizing modifiers or new names to signal significant departures, and managing brand portfolios and hierarchies to foster consumer loyalty amidst continuous innovation.

### Services

We noted in Chapter 1 that the level of sophistication in service branding has greatly increased in recent years, as suggested by the following guidelines (see Figure 15-14).

**Maximize service quality by recognizing the myriad ways to affect consumer service perceptions.** It is challenging to develop brands for intangible services. Consumers may have difficulty forming their quality evaluations and may therefore base them on considerations other than their own service experience.

Researchers have identified a number of dimensions of service quality:<sup>13</sup>

* **Tangibles:** Physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of personnel  
* **Reliability:** Ability to perform the promised service right the first time (standardized facilities and operations)

Figure 15-14 outlines five additional guidelines for enhancing services, focusing on a multi-faceted approach to brand management and consumer experience. The guidelines emphasize maximizing service quality by understanding and influencing consumer perceptions, and leveraging a comprehensive suite of brand elements to boost recall and convey tangible brand attributes. Furthermore, the recommendations include cultivating strong organizational associations and developing corporate communication programs that enrich consumer service encounters. Finally, establishing a clear brand hierarchy through distinct family, individual, or ingredient brands is presented as a strategic imperative. This framework suggests a hierarchical and interconnected strategy for service branding, where each guideline contributes to a cohesive and impactful consumer experience. * Responsiveness: Willingness to help customers and provide customer service
