In fashion, the Armani brand has extended from high-end Giorgio Armani and Giorgio Armani Privé, to mid-range luxury with Emporio Armani, to affordable luxury with Armani Jeans and Armani Exchange.

As part of a plan to upgrade, Holiday Inn Worldwide broke its domestic hotels into five separate chains to tap into five different benefit segments: the upscale Crowne Plaza, the traditional Holiday Inn, the budget Holiday Inn Express, and the business-oriented Holiday Inn Select (although soon to be phased-out) and Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites. Different branded chains received different marketing programs and emphasis. A $100 million global ad campaign themed “Stay You” was launched in 2010 as part of the $1 billion brand refresh undertaken for the flagship Holiday Inn brand.  
In each case for Holiday Inn, a clear differentiation existed between brands, minimizing the potential for brand overlap and accompanying consumer confusion and brand cannibalization. Each extension also lived up to the core promise of the parent brand, thus reducing the possibility that any would hurt the parent’s image.

**Naming Strategies.** Firms often adopt sub-branding strategies to distinguish their lower-priced entries. US Airways introduced US Airways Shuttle as an inexpensive short-haul carrier to compete with no-frills Southwest Airlines in the lucrative Eastern corridor market. Such extension introductions clearly must be handled carefully; typically, the parent brand plays a secondary role.

An even more difficult vertical extension is an upward brand stretch. In general, it is difficult to change people’s impressions of the brand enough to justify a significant upward extension. Concern about the unwillingness of consumers to update their brand knowledge was what led Honda, Toyota, and Nissan to introduce their luxury car models as separate nameplates (Acura, Lexus, and Infiniti, respectively). As it turns out, product improvements to the upper ends of their brand lines since the introduction of these new car nameplates may have made it easier to bridge the gap into the luxury market with their brands. When it later elected to move downmarket, Toyota developed the Scion brand in part to avoid reducing the strength of the Toyota image.

At the same time, it is possible to use certain brand modifiers to signal a noticeable, although presumably not dramatic, quality improvement—for example, Ultra Dry Pampers, Extra Strength Tylenol, or PowerPro Dustbuster Plus. These indirect extensions, or “super-brands,” may be less risky than direct extensions when moving a master brand up-market.

To avoid the potential difficulties associated with vertical extensions, however, companies sometimes elect to use new and different brand names to expand vertically. The Gap has employed a three-tier approach, using the Banana Republic brand to command a 40 percent price premium that the Gap would likely never attain on its own and launching the Old Navy brand to offer 40 percent discounts.

By developing unique brand names, companies pursuing vertical expansion can avoid a negative transfer of equity from a “lower” brand to a “higher” brand, but they sacrifice some ability to transfer positive associations. Yet when the parent brand makes no secret of its ownership of the vertical brands, as is the case with both the Gap and Toyota, some associations may be transferred because the parent acts as a “shadow endorser” of the new brand.

Branding Brief 12-3 illustrates how Mambo has been able to expand its market coverage and attract new consumers through vertical extensions into discount clothing and apparel.

# EVALUATING BRAND EXTENSION OPPORTUNITIES

Academic research and industry experience have revealed a number of principles governing successful brand extensions. Marketers must consider their strategies carefully by systematically following the steps listed in Figure 12-6 and using managerial judgment and marketing research to help make *each* of these decisions.

### Define Actual and Desired Consumer Knowledge about the Brand

It’s critical for marketers to fully understand the depth and breadth of awareness of the parent brand, and the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of its associations. Moreover, marketers Mambo is an iconic Australian surf brand, famous for its loud, politically incorrect, and outlandish T-shirt designs.
