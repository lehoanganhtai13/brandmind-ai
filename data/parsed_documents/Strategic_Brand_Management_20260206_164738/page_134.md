The Brand Value Chain Model outlines a sequential process linking marketing efforts to financial outcomes. It begins with **Marketing Activity**, encompassing all brand-related initiatives. These activities influence the **Customer Mind-Set**, which represents consumer perceptions, attitudes, and awareness of the brand. Positive customer mind-sets, in turn, drive **Market Performance**, reflecting tangible results like sales, market share, and brand loyalty. Ultimately, improved market performance contributes to enhanced **Shareholder Value**, the ultimate financial objective. This model illustrates a cause-and-effect relationship, demonstrating how strategic marketing actions can cascade through customer perception and market dynamics to create economic value for the company.

The Brand Resonance Model, presented as a hierarchical structure, begins with **Salience** at its base, representing the awareness and availability of the brand. Building upon this foundation are two key dimensions: **Judgments**, which encompass perceptions of brand performance and quality, and **Feelings**, relating to the emotional responses evoked by the brand's imagery. At the apex of the model is **Resonance**, signifying the ultimate relationship between a brand and its customers, characterized by a deep psychological bond and a high degree of loyalty and attachment. This model illustrates a progression from basic brand awareness to a profound connection, with judgments and feelings acting as crucial intermediate stages in achieving resonance.

This Brand Positioning Model, presented as a comparative framework, delineates two critical aspects of brand strategy: Points-of-Parity and Points-of-Difference. Points-of-Parity represent the essential attributes or benefits that a brand must possess to be considered a legitimate competitor within its category, establishing a baseline of acceptance. Conversely, Points-of-Difference are the unique attributes or benefits that distinguish a brand from its competitors, providing a compelling reason for consumers to choose it. The model highlights the dual necessity for brands to meet category expectations while simultaneously carving out a distinct and desirable position in the minds of consumers.

and creating the right meaning in terms of brand performance and brand imagery associations.  
A brand with the right identity and meaning can make a customer believe it is relevant and “my kind of product.” The strongest brands will be those to which consumers become so attached and passionate that they, in effect, become evangelists or missionaries and attempt to share their beliefs and spread the word about the brand.

The brand value chain is a means to trace the value creation process for brands to better understand the financial impact of brand marketing expenditures and investments. Taking the customer’s perspective of the value of a brand, the brand value chain assumes that the brand value creation process begins when the firm invests in a marketing program targeting actual or potential customers. Any marketing program investment that potentially can be attributed to brand value development falls into this category, for example, product research, development, and design; trade or intermediary support; and marketing communications.

The marketing activity associated with the program then affects the customer mind-set with respect to the brand—what customers know and feel about the brand. The customer mind-set includes everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand: thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and so forth. Consistent with the brand resonance model, five key dimensions that are particularly important measures of the customer mind-set are brand awareness, brand associations, brand attitudes, brand attachment, and brand activity or experience.

The customer mind-set affects how customers react or respond in the marketplace in a variety of ways. Six key outcomes of that response are price premiums, price elasticities, market share, brand expansion, cost structure, and brand profitability. Based on a thorough understanding of the brand’s past, current and future prospects, as well as other factors, the financial marketplace then formulates opinions and makes various assessments that have direct financial implications for the value of the brand. Three particularly important indicators are the stock price, the price/earnings multiple, and overall market capitalization for the firm.

The model also assumes that a number of linking factors intervene between these stages. These linking factors determine the extent to which value created at one stage transfers or “multiplies” to the next stage. Thus, there are three sets of multipliers that moderate the transfer between the marketing program and the subsequent three value stages: the program multiplier, the customer multiplier, and the market multiplier.
