# THE SCIENCE OF BRANDING 10-1

## The Prophet Brand Valuation Methodology

Prophet’s brand valuation methodology starts with the realization that accountants define an asset as “a resource, under the control of an enterprise, to which future economic benefits will flow.” In the context of a brand, a resource is something a company owns that it uses to achieve an end or fulfill a function, namely to identify the company’s product or service so that consumers can identify it and attach perceptions to it.

Fundamental to Prophet’s approach is that brands generate future economic benefits, in that consumers who know of a brand and prefer it to other choices will spend money buying it now and in the future. The purpose of marketing, according to Prophet, is to find these customers in the first place and keep them over time. Prophet maintains that a credible brand valuation methodology must reflect this definition, which is why it is at the foundation of Prophet’s approach.

Prophet’s brand valuation methodology is also constructed on the basis of sound corporate finance principles and complies with the standards laid down by the U.S. Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB). Specifically, it has four steps:

### 1. Finance

Economic profit (EP) is the profit a company earns that exceeds its cost of capital.<sup>36</sup> Only firms that have developed sustainable competitive advantages over time are able to earn this class of profit. It is generally acknowledged that brands are a major cause of a company earning and sustaining economic profit. The starting point for any valuation is therefore to extract from the income statement and balance sheet the economic profit earned by the brand being valued.

### 2. Brand Contribution

The Prophet brand contribution is a procedure that breaks economic profit into a set of drivers and then isolates the portion that is attributable to the brand’s equity or strength. The Prophet approach employs a classical qualitative/quantitative technique in the following five steps:

1. Using a modified focus group format, senior company management generates a list of probable EP drivers. These are reduced by various rating and ranking methods to between 10 and 15.

2. A panel of about 50 respondents knowledgeable about the category is assembled, and participants are briefed to participate in a two- or three-round set of quantitative questions. These require them to evaluate the driver set and allocate ratings according to relative importance. Thus the list is reduced still further to between 5 and 9.

3. The respondents are asked to evaluate the market competitiveness of each of the drivers in the set, using market-based asset as the criteria. A score out of 100 indicates each one’s relative importance.

4. Finally, respondents are asked to assess each driver’s dependence on, or independence from, the brand’s external equity.

5. The brand equity scores are multiplied by the driver weightings. The products are summed to produce the percentage that is then applied to economic profit to identify the brand portion or contribution. In the model, this profit is called brand premium profit (BPP).

### 3. Category Expected Life

The profit a brand can earn is to a large extent dictated by the nature of the category in which it sells. A category might be as broad as financial services, which can be narrowed to banking and insurance, or as precise as toothpaste, which can be expanded to dental care. Within the category, supply and demand pressures will exert an influence on the price range consumers will tolerate, which in turn determines profit margins brand owners can achieve.

The Prophet model uses an evaluation of the category to measure the extent to which the category encourages or inhibits the earning of economic profit for the brands that compete within it. It does this by looking at four variables: how mature is the category; are brand shares stable or volatile; does competitive activity create high barriers to entry or not; and, how vulnerable is the category to external pressures such as government regulation, raw material supply, and changing fashions. The outcome of this evaluation is to set parameters in years of expected economic life for a strong (dominant) and weak (marginal) brand.

### 4. Brand Knowledge Structure (BKS)

Brand knowledge structure, or BKS, is the bundle of knowledge consumers hold in memory and use to decide what products they need and which of the available brands they will buy. The comparative strength with which this information is held by the category community of users determines the success of the competing brands. It is also a good proxy for risk: the stronger the brand, the more likely consumers are to continue to buy in the future. Brand strength ensures future cash flows. The opposite is equally true. The Prophet method uses market research–based measurements of brand strength and preference to set the number of years in the cash flow projection: the stronger the brand relative to its competitors, the more years in the model.

### The Valuation

The model calculates the value of the brand by working out how many years to project the growing part of the cash flows and then the shape and duration of a theoretical decay period. It does this by merging the BKS data with the category expected life results. The value is the resulting capitalized value of the projected cash flows. The discount rate is a classical weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and risk is taken into account by specially constructed probability weightings of the near term cash flows.
