## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

1. Pick a brand. Employ projective techniques to attempt to identify sources of its brand equity. Which measures work best? Why?  
2. Run an experiment to see whether you can replicate Mason Haire’s instant coffee experiment (see Branding Brief 9-2). Do the same attributions still hold? If not, can you replace coffee with a brand combination from another product category that would produce pronounced differences?  
3. Pick a product category. Can you profile the brand personalities of the leading brands in the category using Aaker’s brand personality inventory?  
4. Pick a brand. How would you best profile consumers’ brand knowledge structures? How would you use quantitative measures?  
5. Think of your brand relationships. Can you find examples of brands that fit into Fournier’s different categories?

### Young & Rubicam’s BrandAsset Valuator

This appendix summarizes BrandAsset® Valuator (BAV), originally developed by Young & Rubicam, now overseen and expanded by BAV Consulting. It is the world’s largest database of consumer-derived information on brands. The BAV model is developmental in that it explains how brands grow, how they get into trouble, and how they recover.

BAV measures brands on four fundamental measures of equity value plus a broad array of perceptual dimensions. It provides comparative measures of the equity value of thousands of brands across hundreds of different categories, as well as a set of strategic brand management tools for planning: brand positioning, brand extensions, joint branding ventures, and other strategies designed to assess and direct brands and their growth. BAV is also linked to financial metrics and is used to determine a brand’s contribution to a company’s valuation.

Since 1993, BAV has carried out research with almost 800,000 consumers in 51 countries, enabling BAV to follow truly global brand trends. Consumers’ perceptions of approximately 45,000 brands have been collected across the same set of 72 dimensions, including 48 image attributes, usage, consideration, and cultural and customer values. These elements are incorporated into a specially developed set of brand loyalty measures.
