# Brand Relationships

Chapter 2 characterized brand relationships in terms of brand resonance and offered possible measures for each of the four key dimensions: behavioral loyalty, attitudinal attachment, sense of community, and active engagement. This section considers additional considerations with respect to each of those four dimensions. Figure 9-9 displays a scale, although developed by its authors to measure overall brand engagement, could easily be adapted to measure brand resonance by replacing mentions of brands with a specific brand. For example, instead of saying, “I have a special bond with the brands I like,” it could say, “I have a special bond with my Saab automobile,” and so on.

## Behavioral Loyalty.

To capture reported brand usage and behavioral loyalty, we could ask consumers several questions directly. Or we could ask them what percentage of their last purchases in the category went to the brand (past purchase history) and what percentage of their planned next purchases will go to the brand (intended future purchases). For example, the marketers or brand managers of Duracell batteries might ask the following questions:

* Which brand of batteries do you usually buy?
* Which brand of batteries did you buy last time?
* Do you have any batteries on hand? Which brand?
* Which brands of batteries did you consider buying?
* Which brand of batteries will you buy next time?

These types of questions can provide information about brand attitudes and usage for Duracell, including potential gaps with competitors and the names of other brands that might be in the consideration set at the time of purchase.

Marketers can make their measures open ended, force consumers to choose one of two brands, or offer multiple choice or rating scales. They can compare the answers with actual measures of consumer behavior to assess whether consumers are accurate in their predictions. For example, if 30 percent of consumers reported, on average, that they thought they would take their vitamins daily over the next two weeks, but only 15 percent of consumers reported two weeks later that they actually had done so during that period, then Centrum brand managers might need to devise strategies to better convert intentions to actual behavior.

In a business-to-business setting, Narayandas advocates analyzing sales records, talking to sales teams, and conducting surveys to assess where customers stand on a “loyalty ladder.”<sup>47</sup> Several different approaches have been suggested to measure the second component of brand resonance—brand attachment.<sup>48</sup> Some researchers like to characterize it in terms of brand love.<sup>49</sup> One study proposed a brand love scale that consists of 10 items:
