For example, at the height of the dot-com boom, online retailer Outpost.com used ads featuring gerbils shot from cannons, wolverines attacking marching bands, and preschoolers having the brand name tattooed on their foreheads. The problem with such approaches is that they invariably fail to create strong category links because the product is just not prominent enough in the ad. They also can generate a fair amount of ill will. Often coming across as desperate measures, they rarely provide a foundation for long-term brand equity. In the case of Outpost.com, most potential customers did not have a clue what the company was about.

### Brand Image
Creating brand awareness by increasing the familiarity of the brand through repeated exposure (for brand recognition) and forging strong associations with the appropriate product category or other relevant purchase or consumption cues (for brand recall) is an important first step in building brand equity. Once a sufficient level of brand awareness is created, marketers can put more emphasis on crafting a brand image.

### FRENZ HOTEL
To create a positive brand image, Frenz Hotel needed to sufficiently develop its brand awareness. Frenz Hotel, founded in 2010, is a Malaysian boutique hotel in Kuala Lumpur that has 86 boutique-style rooms and suites. It aims to combine elegance, modern technology, and luxury. The motto “Where Guests Become Friends,” is aimed not only at local customers with medium- to higher-income levels, but also at leisure and business travelers. Although the hotel has won awards, such as TripAdvisor’s “2012 Travelers’ Choice Award,” customer brand awareness of this hotel is still relatively low. The hotel has taken a step in the right direction by introducing itself to Facebook, a move that will encourage close links with fans and help spread its name. In addition to social networking sites, Frenz Hotel has also become involved with transit advertising using local taxis. The tagline, “Stay with Frenz,” has been displayed on the back of selected taxis in Kuala Lumpur. The attractive layout of the ad aims to catch the attention of potential customers. As of March 2012, Frenz Hotel’s revenue has increased by 15 percent compared to 2011 totals; guests now need to make their bookings at least a week in advance due to high demand.[20]
