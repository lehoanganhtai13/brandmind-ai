# BRANDING BRIEF 1-2

## Branding Commodities

Over the years, a number of products that at one time were seen as essentially commodities have become highly differentiated as strong brands have emerged in the category. Some notable examples are coffee (Maxwell House), bath soap (Ivory), flour (Gold Medal), beer (Budweiser), salt (Morton), oatmeal (Quaker), pickles (Vlasic), bananas (Chiquita), chickens (Perdue), pineapples (Dole), and even water (Perrier).

These products became branded in various ways. The key success factor in each case, however, was that consumers became convinced that all the product offerings in the category were not the same and that meaningful differences existed. In some instances, such as with produce, marketers convinced consumers that a product was *not* a commodity and could actually vary appreciably in quality. In these cases, the brand was seen as ensuring uniformly high quality in the product category on which consumers could depend. In other cases, like Perrier bottled mineral water, because product differences were virtually nonexistent, brands have been created by image or other non-product-related considerations.

One of the best examples of branding a commodity in this fashion is diamonds. De Beers Group added the phrase “A Diamond Is Forever” as the tagline in its ongoing ad campaign in 1948. The diamond supplier, which was founded in 1888 and sells about 60 percent of the world’s rough diamonds, wanted to attach more emotion and symbolic meaning to the purchase of diamond jewelry. “A Diamond Is Forever” became one of the most recognized slogans in advertising and helped fuel a diamond jewelry industry that’s now worth nearly $25 billion per year in the United States alone.

After years of successful campaigns that helped generate buzz for the overall diamond industry, De Beers began to focus on its proprietary brands. Its 2009 campaign highlighted its new Everlon line. Partly in reaction to the recession, De Beers’s marketing also began to focus on the long-term value and staying power of diamonds; new campaigns included the slogans “Fewer Better Things” and “Here Today, Here Tomorrow.”

Opportunities and more profitable relationships. A strong brand can provide valuable reassurance and clarity to business customers who may be putting their company’s fate—and perhaps their own careers!—on the line. A strong business-to-business brand can thus provide a strong competitive advantage.

Some B2B firms, however, carry the attitude that purchasers of their products are so well-informed and professional that brands don’t matter. Savvy business marketers reject that reasoning and are recognizing the importance of their brand and how they must execute well in a number of areas to gain marketplace success.

Boeing, which makes everything from commercial airplanes to satellites, implemented the “One Firm” brand strategy to unify all its different operations with a one-brand culture. The strategy was based in part on a “triple helix” representation:  
1) Enterprising Spirit (*why* Boeing does what it does),  
2) Precision Performance (*how* Boeing gets things done), and  
3) Defining the Future (*what* Boeing achieves as a firm).<sup>19</sup>  

The Science of Branding 1-1 describes some particularly important guidelines for business-to-business branding. Here is how Infosys approaches brand differentiation to persuade businesses to select it as their partner of choice.

## INFOSYS

Infosys is an Indian IT services company that exploited the outsourcing trend of companies to outsource its IT functions to specialist providers. It increased its drive-up sales from $100 million in 1999 to over $2 billion by 2006. Over a 25-year period, 93 percent of Infosys’s projects were delivered on time and on budget, against an industry average of 30 percent. Having taken 23 years to achieve the first $1 billion sales, it took just 23 months to reach $2 billion in sales.

Once it achieved $2 billion in sales, Infosys rebranded itself to other businesses as a company that could help them improve their business models. By selling itself as a business process transformation partner rather than just an outsourcing firm, Infosys successfully differentiated itself from the competition. It communicated the change in strategy to 50,000 of its employees and then formally launched it to targeted businesses, communicating to C level employees, business line managers, sourcing executives, and IT staff members.
