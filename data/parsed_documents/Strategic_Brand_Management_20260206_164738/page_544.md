## Locals Going Global

Due to its high-profile acquisition of IBM’s PC unit, Lenovo is likely the best-known Chinese company seeking to build its brands abroad. Observers predict that many other brands will likewise follow in the footsteps of Korea’s Samsung, LG, and Hyundai as Asian brands that rose from obscurity to global prominence in a matter of decades.

To better compete in overseas markets, appliance maker Haier increased its R&D spending to 4 percent of revenues. “In the past, we tried to design our products in Qingdao and sell them to the U.S. and Japan,” explained CEO Zhang Ruimin. “They didn’t meet overseas consumers’ needs and didn’t sell well.”<sup>96</sup> By 2004, Haier had 22 factories overseas, and distribution at Walmart, Sears, and Best Buy helped its foreign revenues rise to $1.3 billion, or 13 percent of total revenues.

Athletic clothing and equipment maker Li-Ning sought to build its international profile by outfitting many Chinese athletes for the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympics, and by acquiring the rights to use NBA players and logos in its marketing.<sup>97</sup> Other Chinese brands to set out for foreign soil include electronics firm TCL, cell phone manufacturer China Kejian, networking equipment maker Huawei, and Tsingtao beer.

These moves abroad are, in part, simply a function of the pressures facing large firms searching for sources of revenue growth beyond an increasingly competitive domestic market. Another cause is official encouragement from the Chinese government, which dictated that between 30 and 50 state firms should be built into “national champions” or “globally competitive” companies by 2010<sup>98</sup> and therefore exhorted Chinese companies “to set up overseas operations, acquire foreign assets, and transform themselves into multinational corporations.”<sup>99</sup> A related reason is global brand recognition as a source of national pride. One Chinese industrialist had a slogan printed on the wall of one of his factories that captured this source of Chinese companies’ global aspirations: “One who earns money in China is a winner; one who earns money overseas is a hero.”<sup>100</sup>

Yet the path to global brand leadership remains fraught with complications. As of 2011, no Chinese brand could be considered a truly global brand powerhouse. In fact, one advertising executive working in China argued that “Chinese companies are light years away” from exporting their brands successfully.<sup>101</sup> Put plainly, Chinese companies were behind the curve when it came to branding compared to global competitors, a fact Haier CEO Zhang readily acknowledged, saying “[Chinese companies] started brand development very late, so we have to catch up in a very short period of time.”<sup>102</sup>

Companies that did have an international presence, such as Haier and Lenovo, were priced as entry-level bargains, like their Korean predecessors. To shortcut their way to brand recognition and respect, some Chinese firms began bidding for foreign brands, as Lenovo did with IBM. Others, like Haier, invest more heavily in R&D to bolster their images through innovation. Despite the difficulties, one consultant remained optimistic about Chinese brands one day taking their place as global brand leaders:

> Market shares will go up and down. Some Chinese companies will lose. It’s a learning process. But there is no doubt that world-class Chinese brands will emerge.<sup>103</sup>
