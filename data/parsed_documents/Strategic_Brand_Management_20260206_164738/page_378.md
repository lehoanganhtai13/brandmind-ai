One advantage of the Interbrand valuation approach is that it is very generalizable and can be applied to virtually any type of brand or product.

Three key components contribute to the brand value assessment: (1) the financial performance of the branded products or services, (2) the role of brand in the purchase decision process, and (3) the strength of the brand. Here’s how Interbrand addresses each of these three components.

**Brand Financial Performance.**  
Financial performance for the brand reflects an organization’s raw financial return to the investors and is analyzed as economic profit, a concept akin to economic value added (EVA). To determine economic profit, subtract taxes from net operating profit to arrive at net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). From NOPAT, subtract a capital charge to account for the capital used to generate the brand’s revenues, yielding the economic profit for each year analyzed. The capital charge rate is set by the industry-weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The financial performance is analyzed for a five-year forecast and for a terminal value. The terminal value represents the brand’s expected performance beyond the forecast period. The economic profit that is calculated is then multiplied by the role of brand (a percentage, as described below) to determine the branded earnings that contribute to the valuation total.

**Role of Brand.**  
Role of brand measures the portion of the customer decision to purchase that is attributable to brand—exclusive of other purchase drivers such as price or product features. Conceptually, role of brand reflects the portion of demand for a branded product or service that exceeds what the demand would be for the same product or service if it were unbranded. We can determine role of brand in different ways, including primary research, a review of historical roles of brand for companies in that industry, and expert panel assessment. We multiply the percentage for the role of brand by the economic profit of the branded products or services to determine the amount of branded earnings that contribute to the valuation total.

**Brand Strength.**  
Brand strength measures the ability of the brand to secure the delivery of expected future earnings. Brand strength is reported on a scale of 0–100 based on an evaluation across 10 dimensions of brand activation. Performance in these dimensions is generally judged relative to other brands in the industry. The brand strength inversely determines a discount rate, through a proprietary algorithm. That rate is used to discount branded earnings back to a present value, based on the likelihood that the brand will be able to withstand challenges and deliver the expected earnings.

**Summary.**  
Brand valuation and the “brands on the balance sheet” debate are controversial subjects. There is no one universally agreed-upon approach. In fact, many marketing experts feel it is impossible to reduce the richness of a brand to a single, meaningful number, and that any formula that tries to do so is an abstraction and arbitrary.

The primary disadvantage of valuation approaches is that they necessarily have to make a host of potentially oversimplified assumptions to arrive at one measure of brand equity. For example, Sir Michael Perry, former chairman of Unilever, once objected for philosophical reasons:

> The seemingly miraculous conjuring up of intangible asset values, as if from nowhere, only serves to reinforce the view of the consumer skeptics, that brands are just high prices and consumer exploitation.

Wharton’s Peter Fader points out a number of limitations of valuation approaches: they require much judgmental data and thus contain much subjectivity; intangible assets are not always synonymous with brand equity; the methods sometimes defy common sense and lack “face validity”; the financial measures generally ignore or downplay current investments in future equity like advertising or R&D; and the strength of the brand measures may be confounded with the strength of the company.

At the heart of much of the criticism is the issue of separability we identified earlier. An *Economist* editorial put it this way: “Brands can be awkward to separate as assets. With Cadbury’s Dairy Milk, how much value comes from the name Cadbury? How much from Dairy Milk? How much merely from the product’s (replicable) contents or design?”

To draw a sports analogy, extracting brand value may be as difficult as determining the value of the coach to a team’s performance. And the way a brand is managed can have a large Companies make acquisitions because they wish to grow and expand their business.
