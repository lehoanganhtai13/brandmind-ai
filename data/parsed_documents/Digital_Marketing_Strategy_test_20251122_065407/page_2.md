# Figure 1.2 Automotive perceptual map

This table presents a comparative categorization of car brands based on two primary dimensions: price (Cheap to Expensive) and practicality (Practical to Sporty). The structure is a matrix where brands are positioned within this two-dimensional space. At the "Cheap" end, brands like Toyota, Honda, Chrysler, and Skoda are listed, suggesting a focus on affordability. As the spectrum moves towards "Expensive," brands such as Jaguar, Mercedes, Lexus, and Land Rover appear. The "Sporty" dimension is represented by a distinct column featuring high-performance brands like Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, and Audi. Brands like Ford and Volkswagen are positioned more centrally, potentially indicating a balance between practicality and sportiness, or a broader range of offerings. The overall arrangement illustrates a market segmentation strategy, differentiating vehicles by their cost and intended use.

You then have a brand and it is being seen by thousands and potentially millions of people almost immediately.

Customer lifetime value (CLTV or sometimes LTV) is quite simply the value or profit attributed to a customer for their entire customer lifecycle. This can be relatively simple to calculate in some businesses and incredibly complex Facebook is a great example of a business model that has had to adapt quickly.
