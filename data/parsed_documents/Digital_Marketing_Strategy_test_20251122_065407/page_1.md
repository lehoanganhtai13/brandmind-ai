# Brand or perceptual positioning map

It is useful to use a brand positioning map to develop your market positioning strategy for your products or services. These maps are not, however, built from your views of your marketplace but from the perceptions of consumers and so are sometimes called perceptual maps. These maps give a clear view, albeit a little subjective, of where your brand or products sit versus your competitors, thus highlighting any gaps in the market and demonstrating where there are areas of intense competition.

Most perceptual maps are drawn with two axes, X and Y. They intersect each other in the centre and so form a cross. This is not the only way to draw a positioning map but it is by far the most common. What you choose to place on the axes is up to you and you therefore need to consider the variables in your industry and what is the goal of your research. If we were to draw a map of automotive brands using the scales of practicality and affordability (see Figure 1.2) we can see quite clearly where the direct competition lies in terms of perception and where there may be gaps in the market. This is also useful to determine where your brand is perceived to be and can help you to construct your strategy for moving your brand to where you want it to be.

As well as reviewing where your business or brand is positioned today, perceptual maps can also help you to identify opportunities for launching new brands. If the map of the automotive industry shown in Figure 1.2 were to be the output of actual research, you could decide that launching a brand that stands for sports and performance but is in the mid-price range would have little competition and so might be an opportunity. On the other hand you need to combine this thinking with the size of the market. For example, in Figure 1.2 no brands are perceived to be very sporty and very cheap so there is a gap there, but is this because that is not a profitable opportunity or because when people buy sporty cars they expect to spend money and would not trust a cheap sports car?

**What does this mean for digital marketing?** In relation to positioning maps there is no specific difference between digital marketing and any other form of marketing. As mentioned at the start of this book, marketing is the key word. Brand is one of the areas where having an integrated approach is absolutely vital to success. Considering how your brand performs across all marketing considerations is essential, and whilst it is important to include digital within this, it should not have its own separate approach.

One thing that is worth bearing in mind here is that it is much easier to launch a brand today than it was in the 20th century. You can fire up your laptop at home, design a logo in Photoshop, create a website using Wordpress, create a Twitter account and build a Google Ads account all in one evening.
