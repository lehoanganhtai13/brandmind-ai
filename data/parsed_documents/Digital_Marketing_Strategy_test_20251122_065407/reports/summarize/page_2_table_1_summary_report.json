  "summary_markdown": "This table presents a comparative categorization of car brands based on two primary dimensions: price (Cheap to Expensive) and practicality (Practical to Sporty). The structure is a matrix where brands are positioned within this two-dimensional space. At the \"Cheap\" end, brands like Toyota, Honda, Chrysler, and Skoda are listed, suggesting a focus on affordability. As the spectrum moves towards \"Expensive,\" brands such as Jaguar, Mercedes, Lexus, and Land Rover appear. The \"Sporty\" dimension is represented by a distinct column featuring high-performance brands like Ferrari, Porsche, BMW, and Audi. Brands like Ford and Volkswagen are positioned more centrally, potentially indicating a balance between practicality and sportiness, or a broader range of offerings. The overall arrangement illustrates a market segmentation strategy, differentiating vehicles by their cost and intended use.",
