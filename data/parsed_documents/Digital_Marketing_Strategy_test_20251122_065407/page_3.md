## Changing business models

### Facebook

I would imagine that even Mark Zuckerberg was surprised by the speed at which Facebook grew from being one of many college social networks to the leading global hub for a significant percentage of the world to share their lives on. The initial model of providing a network for college students had to develop a broader appeal once the growth became inevitable. As this growth took hold it was clear that costs would also accelerate and, with no obvious income, something had to be done and so the business pages and advertising models had to be developed in order to monetize the site. These shifts in the way that the business had to change to deal with its own growth have been both significant and impressive in their speed and success. This is an excellent example of how adapting your strategy to meet the changing needs of your consumers and the evolution of your business is vital. Facebook has had to do this through the above changes to their website and user experience. We will look at this area in more detail in Chapter 16.

### Google

It is hard to believe that Google spent a long time with no real income channel. The initial business model was successful by creating the best search engine in terms of accuracy and simplicity. Google became a verb as people realized that Googling something would give better results than using another engine. However, a source of income needed to be developed. This is why Adwords (now Google Ads) was introduced in 2003 and that has gone on to become the foundation of the growth of every other arm of the Google we know today – a business with an incredibly diverse and profitable range of services.
