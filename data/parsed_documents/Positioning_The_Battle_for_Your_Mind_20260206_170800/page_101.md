“The disadvantages of Benson & Hedges” launched the brand and burned the name into the mind of the cigarette smokers.  
Benson & Hedges became known as the first, the original, the inventor of the 100-mm concept.  
But, of course, it wasn’t. The first 100-mm cigarette was Pall Mall Gold, but Pall Mall fell into the line-extension trap.  
Then Benson & Hedges moved in and preempted the long-cigarette position.  
You’d think the missed opportunity represented by Pall Mall Gold would have discouraged them.  
But it didn’t. As we said, the logic in favor of line extension is overwhelming.  
So now we have Pall Mall Menthol, Pall Mall Extra Mild, and Pall Mall Light 100s. The confusion has detracted from sales of the basic Pall Mall brand.  
Take Pall Mall Menthol, for example. Again, the logic is unassailable to the manufacturer. “Menthol cigarettes like Kool and Salem are getting a larger and larger share of the market.… If we had a menthol brand, we could capture a share of that growing market.”  
Introducing Pall Mall Menthol. Which never achieved more than 7 percent of the volume of Kool.  
In 1964 Pall Mall was the No. 1 cigarette brand in the United States.  
In 1965 Pall Mall line-extended for the first time. They also fell to second place in sales. Every year since, Pall Mall’s share of the American cigarette market has declined.  
From 14.4 percent in 1964 to 3.8 percent today.  
Line-extension logic in cigarettes should work two ways. Since regular brands represent a large share of the market, would you introduce a Kool nonmenthol?  
Of course not. Kool was the original menthol cigarette. Kool means menthol. Like Bayer means aspirin.  
Today a well-stocked tobacco shop will carry well over 100 different brands (including line extensions) out of an industry that produces in the neighborhood of 1.75 brands. It boggles the mind.  
Naturally, the two leading brands, Marlboro and Winston, have long since line-extended the lights, 100-mm, and menthol. So according to the theory, can you expect to see the Marlboro and Winston brands follow in Pall Mall’s steps?
