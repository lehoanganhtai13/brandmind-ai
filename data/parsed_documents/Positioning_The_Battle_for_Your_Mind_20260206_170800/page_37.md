Thirty years ago the six leading cigarette companies between them offered the American smoker 17 different brands. Today they sell more than 175. (A vending machine built to hold all these brands would have to be 30 feet long.)

“Modelitus” has struck every industry, from automobiles to beer to zoom lenses. Detroit currently sells 290 different models in a bewildering variety of styles and sizes. Caravelle, Capri, Cimarron, Camaro, Calais, Cutlass. Let’s see, is it a Chevrolet Caravelle or a Plymouth Caravelle? The public is confused.

To cope with complexity, people have learned to simplify everything.

When asked to describe an offspring’s intellectual progress, a person doesn’t usually quote vocabulary statistics, reading comprehension, mathematical ability, etc. “He’s in seventh grade” is a typical reply.

This ranking of people, objects, and brands is not only a convenient method of organizing things but also an absolute necessity to keep from being overwhelmed by the complexities of life.

## The product ladder

To cope with the product explosion, people have learned to rank products and brands in the mind. Perhaps this can best be visualized by imagining a series of ladders in the mind. On each step is a brand name. And each different ladder represents a different product category.

* Some ladders have many steps. (Seven is many.) Others have few, if any.
* A competitor that wants to increase its share of the business must either dislodge the brand above (a task that is usually impossible) or somehow relate its brand to the other company’s position.
* Yet too many companies embark on marketing and advertising programs as if the competitor’s position did not exist. They advertise their products in a vacuum and are disappointed when their messages fail to get through.
* Moving up the ladder in the mind can be extremely difficult if the brands above have a strong foothold and no leverage or positioning strategy is applied.
* An advertiser who wants to introduce a new product category must carry in a new ladder. This, too, is difficult, especially if the new category is not positioned against the old one. The mind has no room for what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old.
