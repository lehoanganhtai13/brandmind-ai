In the positioning era, however, the rules are reversed. To establish a position, you must often not only name competitive names but also ignore most of the old advertising rules as well.

In category after category, the prospect already knows the benefits of using the product. To climb on his or her product ladder, you must relate your brand to the brands already in the prospect’s mind.

Yet repositioning programs, even though effective, have stirred up a host of complaints. Many advertising people deplore the use of such tactics.

An old-time advertising man put it this way. “Times have changed. No longer are advertisers content to huckster their own wares on their own merits. Their theme now is how much better their product is than any other. It is a deplorable situation, with TV as the worst offender, where competitive products are pictured and denigrated before the eyes of millions. There should be some kind of regulation to restrict that type of unethical marketing.”

“Comparative advertising is not against the law,” said the chairman of a top 10 agency, “nor should it be. But to practice it as we do today makes a mockery of pretensions to culture and refinement and decent corporate behavior.”

You can’t have it both ways. If you want culture and refinement, you produce operas. If you want to make money, you produce movies.

Culture and refinement may be admirable qualities, but not in advertising.

Is society sick when people are ready to believe the worst about a product or person, but balk about believing the best?

Are newspapers wrong to put the bad news on the front page and the good news in the back along with the society columns? (If they print any at all.)

The communication industry is like gossip. It feeds on the bad news, not the good.

It may not be your idea of the way things should be. It just happens to be the way things are.

To be successful in this overcommunicated society of ours, you have to play the game by the rules that society sets. Not your own.

Don’t be discouraged. A little disparagement may be preferable in the long run to a lot of conventional “brag and boast.” Done honestly and fairly, it keeps the competition on their toes.
