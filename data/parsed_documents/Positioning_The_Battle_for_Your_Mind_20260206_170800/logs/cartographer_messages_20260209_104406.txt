Analyze the document structure in this folder and create a global_map.json file.

Follow your cognitive workflow:
1. RECONNAISSANCE: Find the Table of Contents
2. TARGET ACQUISITION: For each section, verify location and pinpoint exact line numbers
3. CONTEXTUALIZATION: Create rich, detailed summaries with concepts and entities
4. ARTIFACT GENERATION: Write the complete JSON to /global_map.json

Remember: Use write_file tool to save the final JSON. Do not output JSON in chat.

💭 Thinking:
  **My Analysis and Plan to Generate a Global Map**

Okay, so the user wants me to essentially perform a deep dive into the markdown files within the current directory and build a `global_map.json` file. The core concept is to provide a structured representation of the content, akin to an index or cross-referenced overview. I understand the importance of this task for complex document analysis.

I've been given a very clear cognitive workflow, and I'll stick to it. First, I need to begin with **RECONNAISSANCE**. I need to locate the table of contents in each markdown file. This is the foundation; it's the map to the map.

Next, it's all about **TARGET ACQUISITION**. I'll need to pinpoint where each section described in the ToC actually lives. Finding the exact line numbers is the crucial aspect here.

Then, there is the **CONTEXTUALIZATION** phase. The goal is to move beyond the structure and craft summaries of each section. This will enrich the data in the map.

Finally, comes **ARTIFACT GENERATION**. Based on my preceding analysis, I will synthesize all this data into the specified JSON format and save it as `global_map.json`.

So, the first thing I'll do is get a list of the files in the current working directory, to get a handle on the landscape before I begin to dissect the individual markdown files.

**Initial Assessment: Navigating the File Structure**

Right, so I'm presented with this collection of `page_N.md` files. My immediate strategy is to treat this like any well-structured documentation set. The first thing I always look for is a Table of Contents (TOC). It's the key to understanding the overall architecture and how the various components relate to each other.

Therefore, my initial focus will be on the likely candidates for containing this TOC. I'll start with the most obvious and traditional locations: `page_1.md`, `page_2.md`, and then `page_3.md`. These are the typical starting points and offer the highest probability of success. From there, I'll be able to quickly gain an understanding of the material.

**Initial Assessment: Navigating the Landscape**

Alright, let's dive in. My first instinct is to get a lay of the land, understand the scope of this document. I'll start with the initial pages – probably the first three or four, tops – to zero in on the Table of Contents. This gives me the crucial overview, the architecture of the argument, the key sections and how they're connected. This is foundational; without knowing the organization, I'm just wandering in the dark. Once I have that framework, I can begin to assess the specific content.

Are there alternative methods that would have yielded more robust results? More specifically, I'm thinking about the implications of the presented approach on [ *specific aspect relevant to user's field* ]. And, are the presented results consistent with expectations, or should I start probing for hidden errors or biases? Is there sufficient rigor to support any claims or conclusions that will be made later on.

Alright, let's zero in. "Checking Page 7" is my current directive, and I'm instantly filtering the implications. Is this a code review? A manuscript edit? Data analysis? The specifics matter. Page 7 *of what* is the key question. I'm immediately running through the potential contexts – I'm automatically accessing my mental index of projects and their associated page lengths, file structures, relevant documents, all the things that might correspond. Depending on the discipline, I’m mentally scanning for the usual pitfalls: data anomalies, logical fallacies, stylistic inconsistencies, or maybe some unexpected technical detail. It could be any of those. The precise significance of "Page 7" is context-dependent, and that's my starting point. What am I expected to *do* with it, I'm already asking myself. Is it about content, methodology, or something else entirely? Time to get to work.

**Initial Assessment of the Document's Structure**

Alright, so I've zeroed in on the "Contents" section, starting on page 7. My initial impression is that it's a descriptive table of contents, not just a bare-bones list. That's a good sign – it provides some context, which is always helpful, especially when dealing with complex subjects. It looks like the section only lists up to Chapter 5, so I'll need to continue flipping through the pages to get the full scope of chapters outlined.

Now, let's move on to page 8 and see what we can find. I expect there to be a further list of the chapters, or some additional information on the subject.

**Page 10 Musings on the Implications**

Alright, so we're on page 10. And as I review the findings presented thus far, my mind immediately jumps to the downstream consequences and subtle nuances that are likely being missed in this initial presentation. The core argument seems solid enough, but the assumptions, the *underlying* assumptions, are where the true gold – or potential flaws – lie.

I'm starting to consider the likely second and third-order effects. The research, as described, hints at A leading to B, and I'm instantly questioning what influences *mediate* that connection. Are there confounding variables? Unaccounted-for feedback loops? I'm already formulating alternative hypotheses in my head, thinking about how I would design experiments to dissect these relationships further and test for causal pathways.

It's tempting to accept the surface-level conclusions, but experience has taught me to dig deeper. I'm examining the methodology, the sample size, the statistical analysis… are the effect sizes reported practically significant, or simply statistically so? Are they truly generalizable, or do they only hold under specific and highly controlled conditions? My primary interest lies in the robustness of the data. And that means understanding all the limitations.

I'm also considering the potential for bias – selection bias, reporting bias, confirmation bias. Has the research team accounted for these possibilities, or are there hints of them in the way the data is presented? What are the potential implications for my own work and where might I challenge the existing hypothesis?

Alright, let's get down to business. I've got the table of contents, a full list of chapter titles, and now my goal is to pinpoint the exact locations of these chapters within the document. It's a classic search-and-find problem, really. I need to nail down those page numbers, even though they aren't explicitly given in the ToC.

My strategy is pretty straightforward. I'm going to leverage `grep`, that trusty workhorse of text search. I'll search across all the files I have, using "Chapter 1," "Chapter 2," and so on as my search terms. This seems like the most efficient way to quickly narrow down the location of each section, I'll then be able to cross-reference with the surrounding text to confirm the page. Simple, direct, and effective. Now, I just need to execute and refine.

**Refining the Search Strategy**

Alright, that initial `grep` wasn't as precise as I needed. It seems to be picking up those matches in the table of contents pages, specifically pages 7, 8, and 9. Not ideal. I need a more targeted approach. My brain is telling me to think about headers. Chapters, sections, that kind of thing. Let's start with a general query to locate those headers. Maybe something along the lines of `# Chapter` or something a bit more generic, just to get a lay of the land.

Before that though, let me double-check the formatting of "Chapter 1". That seems like a more common starting point. I need to know how "Chapter 1" is structured on the actual pages themselves, to craft a search. Actually, let me start with "Introduction" first. That might offer the broadest results to establish a base.

**Navigating the Document**

Alright, so the "Introduction" is definitely kicking off on `page_13.md`, specifically line 11. That's my starting point. Now, the real question is, where does Chapter 1 begin? It should directly follow the introduction logically.

I could manually scan through the files, starting with `page_14.md`, `page_15.md`, and so on, but that feels inefficient, especially given the likelihood of a reasonable amount of text being present within the chapters. **Grep** is the tool for this kind of hunt.

I'm thinking I'll use `grep` to search for "Chapter 1." across the files. Of course, I need to be careful to filter out any false positives from the Table of Contents, which I remember is on pages 7-10. So, I will refine my grep search to be precise, or use some other means to remove these TOC pages. I'll get this done fast.

**Investigating a Discrepancy in the Table of Contents**

Hmm, the Table of Contents is using `### Chapter 1` for the chapter title. That seems a bit... basic. I have a nagging feeling that the *actual* chapter header within the content itself might be more descriptive or nuanced. It's sloppy practice to have them be different. Let's dig in and confirm, or correct, that presumption. I'll need to check the corresponding file, which should contain the actual content of the chapter. A likely candidate is `page_16.md`. Hopefully, the chapter headers are consistent. If not, I'll need to update the ToC as well. This is a common issue with larger documents - often there's a disconnect between the structural overview and the detailed content. This is something I'm used to seeing and needing to fix.

💭 Thinking:
  Here's my take on the thought process, as requested:

**Navigating the Content Structure**

Okay, so I'm looking at the way this content is structured, and it seems the chapter delineation is a little... basic. It looks like the chapter numbers and titles are on separate lines, not using actual Markdown headers with the `#` symbols. That's a bit unusual, and it'll require me to parse things a bit differently. Just a simple text-based structure for chapter divisions.

Let's see... looking at line 11, it's just the number `1` and then on line 12 is the title `What positioning is all about`. Right, got it.

Alright, I'll now check the file `page_15.md` to get a sense of where the Introduction ends. That'll help me understand the full scope of that introductory section before I start to dig deeper into the content itself. Gotta get the lay of the land, you know?
