The core concept is to provide a structured representation of the content, akin to an index or cross-referenced overview. I understand the importance of this task for complex document analysis.\n\nI've been given a very clear cognitive workflow, and I'll stick to it. First, I need to begin with **RECONNAISSANCE**. I need to locate the table of contents in each markdown file. This is the foundation; it's the map to the map.\n\nNext, it's all about **TARGET ACQUISITION**. I'll need to pinpoint where each section described in the ToC actually lives. Finding the exact line numbers is the crucial aspect here.\n\nThen, there is the **CONTEXTUALIZATION** phase. The goal is to move beyond the structure and craft summaries of each section. This will enrich the data in the map.\n\nFinally, comes **ARTIFACT GENERATION**. Based on my preceding analysis, I will synthesize all this data into the specified JSON format and save it as `global_map.json`.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll do is get a list of the files in the current working directory, to get a handle on the landscape before I begin to dissect the individual markdown files.\n\n\n"

My immediate strategy is to treat this like any well-structured documentation set. The first thing I always look for is a Table of Contents (TOC). It's the key to understanding the overall architecture and how the various components relate to each other.\n\nTherefore, my initial focus will be on the likely candidates for containing this TOC. I'll start with the most obvious and traditional locations: `page_1.md`, `page_2.md`, and then `page_3.md`. These are the typical starting points and offer the highest probability of success. From there, I'll be able to quickly gain an understanding of the material.\n\n\n"

What Positioning Is All About  \n    16\tMany people misunderstand the role of communication in business and politics today. In our overcommunicated society, very little communication actually takes place. Rather, a company must create a “position” in the prospect’s mind. A position that takes into consideration not only a company’s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well\n    17\t\n    18\t### Chapter 2. The Assault on the Mind  \n    19\tThere are just too many companies, too many products, too much marketing noise. The per-capita consumption of advertising in America is $376 per year\n    20\t\n    21\t### Chapter 3. Getting Into the Mind  \n    22\tThe easy way to get into a person’s mind is to be first. If you can’t be first, then you must find a way to position yourself against the product, the politician, the person who did get there first\n    23\t\n    24\t### Chapter 4. Those Little Ladders in Your Head  \n    25\tTo cope with our overcommunicated society, people have learned to rank products on mental ladders. In the rent-a-car field, for example, most people put Hertz on the top rung, Avis on the second rung, and National on the third. Before you can position anything, you must know where it is on the product ladder in the mind\n    26\t\n    27\t### Chapter 5. You Can’t Get There from Here  \n    28\tA competitor has no hope of going head-to-head against the position IBM has established in computers. Many companies have ignored this basic **Chapter 6."

And most of the examples are from the most difficult of all forms of communication—advertising. A form of communication that, from the point of view of the recipient, is held in low esteem. Advertising is, for the most part, unwanted and unliked. In some cases, advertising is thoroughly detested.\n    28\t\n    29\tTo many intellectuals, advertising is selling your soul to corporate America—a subject not worthy of serious study.\n    30\t\n    31\tIn spite of its reputation, or perhaps because of it, the field of advertising is a superb testing ground for theories of communication. If it works in advertising, most likely it will work in politics, religion, or any other activity that requires mass communication.\n    32\t\n    33\tSo the examples in this book could just as well have been taken from the field of politics, war, business, or even the science of chasing the opposite sex.

That seems a bit... basic. I have a nagging feeling that the *actual* chapter header within the content itself might be more descriptive or nuanced. It's sloppy practice to have them be different. Let's dig in and confirm, or correct, that presumption. I'll need to check the corresponding file, which should contain the actual content of the chapter. A likely candidate is `page_16.md`. Hopefully, the chapter headers are consistent. If not, I'll need to update the ToC as well. This is a common issue with larger documents - often there's a disconnect between the structural overview and the detailed content. This is something I'm used to seeing and needing to fix.\n\n\n"

Everything you always wanted in a\n    19\tbeer. And less.”\n    20\tPoetic? Yes. Artful? Yes. But also a straightforward, clearly defined\n    21\texplanation of the basic positioning premise.\n    22\tTo be successful today, you must touch base with reality. And the only\n    23\treality that counts is what’s already in the prospect’s mind.\n    24\tTo be creative, to create something that doesn’t already exist in the\n    25\tmind, is becoming more and more difficult. If not impossible.\n    26\tThe basic approach of positioning is not to create something new and\n    27\tdifferent, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the\n    28\tconnections that already exist.\n    29\tToday’s marketplace is no longer responsive to the strategies that\n    30\tworked in the past. There are just too many products, too many companies,\n    31\tand too much marketing noise.\n    32\tThe question most frequently asked by positioning skeptics is, “Why?”\n    33\tWhy do we need a new approach to advertising and marketing?\n    34\t\n    35\tThe overcommunicated society\n    36\tThe answer is that we have become an overcommunicated society. The per-\n    37\tcapita consumption of advertising in America today is $376.62 a year. (That\n    38\tcompares with $16.87 in the rest of the world.)\n    39\tIf you spend $1 million a year on advertising, you are bombarding the\n    40\taverage consumer with less than a half cent of advertising, spread out over\n    41\t365 days—a consumer already exposed to $376.61½ worth of other\n    42\tadvertising."

It looks like the chapter numbers and titles are on separate lines, not using actual Markdown headers with the `#` symbols. That's a bit unusual, and it'll require me to parse things a bit differently. Just a simple text-based structure for chapter divisions.\n\nLet's see... looking at line 11, it's just the number `1` and then on line 12 is the title `What positioning is all about`. Right, got it.\n\nAlright, I'll now check the file `page_15.md` to get a sense of where the Introduction ends. That'll help me understand the full scope of that introductory section before I start to dig deeper into the content itself. Gotta get the lay of the land, you know?\n\n\n"
