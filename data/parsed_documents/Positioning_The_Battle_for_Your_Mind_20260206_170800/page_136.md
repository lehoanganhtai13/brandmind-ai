To send a Mailgram, you call Western Union, which transmits the message electronically to a post office near the recipient. The Mailgram is delivered the next business day.

In addition to sending Mailgrams by telephone, the customer can also send them by telex, TWX, magnetic tape, computer, facsimile equipment, or communicating typewriters.

Why belabor the technicalities? Why discuss the complex details of the Mailgram system?

To make an important point. Most advertising programs never go beyond the details of the product or service which is offered for sale. And the more interesting and complex the service is, the more likely this will happen. The marketing people who are responsible for introducing the product get all wrapped up in the service and forget all about the customer. As a matter of fact, the traditional approach would have been to introduce Mailgram as a “new, automated, computerized electronic communication service” or something of that sort. (Western Union spent millions on computer programming alone, not to mention the enormous expense of earth stations, satellites, etc.)

## The low-cost telegram

Regardless of how much money you spend, regardless of how technologically interesting your service is, to get inside the prospect’s mind, you have to relate to what’s already there. You can’t walk away from your existing position in the prospect’s mind.

And what’s up there in the prospect’s mind? The Telegram, of course.

Anytime you mention the word “Western Union,” the average mind conjures up the most famous yellow message in the history of the world. And the “gram” part of the Mailgram name only reinforces this perception.

So what’s the difference between the new gram and the old gram?

Well, the main difference is price. Both have the same telegraphic format. Both demand immediate attention. But the yellow Telegram message is three times the price of the blue and white Mailgram message.

So the positioning theme developed for Mailgram was simple: “Mailgram: Impact of a Telegram at a fraction of the cost.”

At this point, someone said “Wait a minute. Why position Mailgram against the Telegram, also a Western Union service? Why take business away from ourselves?
