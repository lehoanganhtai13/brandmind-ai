Advertising is entering an era where strategy is king. In the positioning era, it’s not enough to invent or discover something. It may not even be necessary. You must, however, be first to get into the prospect’s mind.  
IBM didn’t invent the computer. Sperry-Rand did. But IBM was the first company to build a computer position in the mind of the prospect.

## What Amerigo discovered  
The Sperry-Rand of the fifteenth century was Christopher Columbus.  
As every schoolchild knows, the man who discovered America was poorly rewarded for his efforts. Christopher Columbus made the mistake of looking for gold and keeping his mouth shut.  
Amerigo Vespucci didn’t. The IBM of the fifteenth century, Amerigo was 5 years behind Christopher. But he did two things right.  
First, he positioned the New World as a separate continent, totally distinct from Asia. This caused a revolution in the geography of his day.  
Second, he wrote extensively of his discoveries and theories. Especially significant are the five letters of his third voyage. One (Mundus Novus) was translated into 40 different languages over a 25-year period.  
Before he died, Spain granted him Castilian citizenship and gave him a major state post.  
As a result, the Europeans credited Amerigo Vespucci with the discovery of America and named the place after him.  
Christopher Columbus died in jail.

## What Michelob discovered  
The great copywriters of yesterday, who have gone to the big ad agency in the sky, would die all over again if they saw some of the campaigns currently running.  
Take beer advertising, for example. In the past a beer copywriter looked closely at the product to find a copy platform. And he or she found product features like “real-draft” Piels and “cold-brewed” Ballantine.  
And even further back a beer copywriter searched for just the right words to paint a picture of quality, taste, and appetite appeal.  
“Just a kiss of the hops.”  
“From the land of sky blue waters.” Today, however, poetry in advertising is as dead as poetry in poetry.
