Take Kraft. A famous name which suffers from terminal line extension.  
What’s a Kraft? It’s everything and yet it’s nothing. In almost no categories is the Kraft brand number one. In mayonnaise, Kraft is second to Hellmann’s. In salad dressing, Kraft is second to Wishbone.  
Where Kraftco has the leading brand in a category, they don’t call it Kraft.  
In cream cheese, it’s Philadelphia, not Kraft.  
In ice cream, it’s Sealtest, not Kraft.  
In margarine, it’s Parkay, not Kraft.  
Where is the strength of the Kraft name? It’s too diffuse. Kraft means everything and nothing. Line extension is a weakness, not a strength.  
What about cheese? Surely Kraft is a strong name in cheese. And it is. “America,” say the ads, “spells cheese K-R-A-F-T.” Terrible spelling and terrible strategy.  
Marketing is like horse racing. The winning horse is not necessarily a good horse. It all depends on the ability of the horses in the race. In a claiming race, the winner is the best of the worst. In a stakes race, the best is the best.  
Kraft has been successful in cheese. Now, name all the other cheese brands you know.  
Kraft is a winner in a claiming race.  
Where there are no brands or weak brands, you can line-extend. But as soon as strong competition arrives, you’re in trouble.

**The bartender test**  
In addition to the shopping list test, there’s the bartender test. What do you get when you order the brand by name?  
“J&B on the rocks” should get you scotch. “A Beefeater martini” should arrive with gin. And “a bottle of Dom Perignon” will definitely get you champagne.  
What about “Cutty on the rocks”? You’ll get scotch, of course, but will you get Cutty Sark or the more expensive 12-year-old Cutty 12?  
Cutty 12 is a typical example of twisted thinking. Combine a well-known name (Cutty) with a descriptive adjective (12). Very logical from the point of view of the distillery.
