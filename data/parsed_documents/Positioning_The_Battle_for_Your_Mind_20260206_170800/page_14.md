Whether you want to promote a car, a cola, a computer, a candidate, or your own career.

Positioning is a concept that has changed the nature of advertising, a concept so simple, people have difficulty understanding how powerful it is.

Every successful politician practices positioning. So do Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson.

## Positioning defined

Positioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself.

But positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.

So it’s incorrect to call the concept “product positioning.” You’re not really doing something to the product itself.

Not that positioning doesn’t involve change. It often does. But changes made in the name, the price, and the package are really not changes in the product at all. They’re basically cosmetic changes done for the purpose of securing a worthwhile position in the prospect’s mind.

Positioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the difficult problem of getting heard in our overcommunicated society.

## How positioning got started

If one word can be said to have marked the course of advertising in the past decade, the word is “positioning.”

Positioning has become a buzzword among advertising, sales, and marketing people. Not only in America, but around the world. Teachers, politicians, and editorial writers are using the word.

Most people think positioning got started in 1972 when we wrote a series of articles entitled “The Positioning Era” for the trade paper *Advertising Age*.

Since then, we have given more than 1000 speeches on positioning to advertising groups in 21 different countries around the world. And we have given away more than 150,000 copies of our “little orange booklet” which reprints the *Advertising Age* articles.
