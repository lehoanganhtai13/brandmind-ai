# Positioning a New Jersey bank

The bank is United Jersey with 116 branches in the state of New Jersey.  
United Jersey is not in the same situation as Long Island Trust. (There is no one positioning approach that will work everywhere.) There are many differences between the two banks, the most important being that unlike Long Island Trust, United Jersey is not the biggest local bank in its marketing territory. (That distinction belongs to First Fidelity with Midlantic in second place and United Jersey in third.)

## Finding a viable banking position

One thing that United Jersey has in common with Long Island Trust is its marketing environment. Both operate in the shadows of Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover, and the other big New York City banks. That’s at the north end of the territory.  
In the south, United Jersey operates in the shadows of the big Philadelphia banks (Mellon, First Pennsylvania).  
The problem of finding a viable banking position is complicated by the fact that the services offered by United Jersey are similar to those of its competitors. Federal and state regulations see to that.  
The only approach that will work is the Tylenol approach. You don’t find the answer to the problem of positioning the bank by studying the bank. You find it by studying the competition, as Tylenol did by studying the problems of aspirin.  
At one end of the scale, United Jersey competes in the marketing jungle known as metropolitan New York City.  
And it really is a banking jungle. In Manhattan alone, there are 389 banks. Not to mention Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and the entire state of New Jersey.  
The King and Queen of the jungle are Citibank and Chase Manhattan. These are big banks. In Manhattan alone Citibank has 74 branches.
