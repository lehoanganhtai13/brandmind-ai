When Alka-Seltzer announces a new product like Alka-Seltzer Plus, everybody stocks up on it. Consumers aren’t necessarily buying it, but retailers are.

So the early sales figures look good. (To book $1 million worth of business, you only have to sell $35 worth to every supermarket.)

Business looks great the first 6 months as you fill the pipelines. But when the reorders don’t come in, all of a sudden things turn dark.

## Long-term disadvantages

After the initial recognition of a line-extension brand, the prospect is never quite sure there is such a product.

Schlitz Light, Pall Mall Extra Mild, Jergens Extra Dry. Brand names like these slide into (and out of) the mind effortlessly. They require almost no mental work on the part of the prospect.

Easy come, easy go. Line-extension names are forgettable because they have no independent position in the mind. They are satellites to the original brand name. Their only contribution is to blur the position occupied by the original name. Often with catastrophic results.

Way back in the thirties, the Ralston Purina Company was running radio commercials for “Ralston 1, 2, 3.” One was Shredded Ralston. Two was Regular Ralston. Three was Instant Ralston.

One, two, three, they’re all gone.

And the legendary David Ogilvy broke his pencil writing advertisements combining Rinso White with Rinso Blue.

Sara Lee tried to get into the frozen dinner field with products like Sara Lee Chicken & Noodles Au Gratin and Sara Lee Beef & Pepper Stew.

Sara Lee owns the dessert position. Nobody doesn’t like Sara Lee, but there were a lot of people out there who didn’t like the chicken & noodles au gratin. And didn’t buy it. Especially with the name Sara Lee on it.

So the kitchens of Sara Lee came in out of the frozen entree field. After dropping some $8 million on the project.

Almost everybody has tried line extension. *Saturday Review Magazine* tried to publish in four different flavors—*The Arts, Science, Education, The Society.* A $17 million loss.

Levi Strauss and Brown Shoe tried to launch, would you believe, “Levi’s for Feet.” Levi is, by far, the market leader in jeans, but this time Then there is Avis flowers, Zenith watches, Old Grand-Dad tobacco, Bic pantyhose, Kleenex diapers.
