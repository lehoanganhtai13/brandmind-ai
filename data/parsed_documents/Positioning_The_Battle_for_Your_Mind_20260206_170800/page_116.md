Of course there are. But it’s quite another matter to build a position based on better people.  
Most people think that the bigger, more successful companies have the better people. And the smaller, less successful companies have the leftovers.  
So if your company occupies the top rung of the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, you can be sure that the prospect will also think that your company has the best people.  
If you’re not on top and you tell the prospect you have the better people. … Well, that’s one of those inconsistencies that doesn’t usually get resolved in your favor.  
If Ford really has the better ideas, why doesn’t it use them in the marketplace to overtake General Motors instead of using them in its advertising to impress the public?  
This is not a question of fact. (Ford could have the better ideas and still be in second place.) This is just a question that springs up in the prospect’s mind.  
And your advertising, to be successful, must answer this question.  

**Diversification is not the answer**  
Next to “people,” the most common corporate positioning theme is “diversification.” Companies want to become known as diversified manufacturers of a wide range of high-quality products.  
But diversification is not effective as a corporate advertising approach. As a matter of fact, the two concepts of positioning and diversification are poles apart.  
It’s a fact of life that strong positions in the prospect’s mind are built on major achievements. Not on broad product lines.  
General Electric is known as the world’s largest electrical manufacturer. Not as a diversified maker of industrial, transportation, chemical, and appliance products.  
Even though General Electric makes thousands of consumer and industrial products, most of its successful products have been electrical ones. Most of its unsuccessful ones have been nonelectrical products. Computers being a typical example.  
General Motors is known as the world’s largest builder of automobiles. Not as a diversified maker of industrial, transportation, and appliance products.
