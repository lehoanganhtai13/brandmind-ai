But it has apparently forgotten one essential element of the 914 program. It was the first to fly the plain-paper copier ocean.

## Covering with multibrands
Most leaders should cover competitive moves by introducing another brand. This is the classic “multibrand” strategy of Procter & Gamble.

It may be a misnomer to call it a multibrand strategy. Rather it’s a single-position strategy.

Each brand is uniquely positioned to occupy a certain location in the mind of the prospect. When times change, when new products come and go, no effort is made to change the position. Rather a new product is introduced to reflect changing technologies and changing tastes.

In other words, Procter & Gamble recognizes the enormous difficulty of moving an established position. When you have one already established, why change it? It may be cheaper and more effective in the long run to introduce a new product. Even if you eventually have to kill off an old, established name.

Ivory was a soap. It still is. When heavy-duty laundry detergents became available, the pressure was probably on to introduce Ivory Detergent. But this would have meant changing the position of Ivory in the prospect’s mind.

A much better solution was Tide. Now the new detergent concept had a new name to match. And Tide became an enormous success.

And when Procter & Gamble introduced a dishwasher detergent, they didn’t call it Dishwasher Tide. They called it Cascade.

Each leading Procter & Gamble brand has its own separate identity: Joy, Crest, Head & Shoulders, Sure, Bounty, Pampers, Comet, Charmin, and Duncan Hines. Not a Plus, Ultra, or Super in the lot.

So a multibrand strategy is really a single-position strategy. One without change. Ivory has been going strong for 99 years.

## Covering with a broader name
What dethrones a leader, of course, is change.
