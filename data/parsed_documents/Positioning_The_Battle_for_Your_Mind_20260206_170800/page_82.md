(You might recognize them as the former Addressograph Multigraph Corp.)  
If you select the company next up in size from every initial company on the Fortune 500 list, you will find the following: Allegheny International, American Motors, Amstar, Bristol-Myers, Celanese, Cluett Peabody, Consolidated Foods, Data General, Gannett, Hartmarx, H. J. Heinz, Hewlett-Packard, Inspiration Resources, Lever Brothers, Louisiana Land & Exploration, Mohasco, National Cooperative Refinery Association, North American Philips, Procter & Gamble, G. D. Searle, Weirton Steel, and Westmoreland Coal.  
Which list of companies is better known? The name companies, of course.  
Some of the initial companies like ITT and NCR are well known, to be sure. But like FDR and JFK, these companies were well known before they dropped their names in favor of initials.  
Which companies are likely to grow faster? Again, the name companies.  
To test this point, we conducted a survey of both “name” and “initial” companies using a *Business Week* subscriber list. The results show the value of a name.  
The average awareness of the “initial” companies was 49 percent. The average awareness of a matched group of “name” companies was 68 percent, 19 percentage points higher.  
What drives big companies into committing corporate suicide? For one thing, the top executives have seen the company’s initials on internal memos for so long they just naturally assume that everybody knows good old VF. Then, too, they misread the reasons for the success of companies like IBM and GE.  

**No shortcuts to success**  
A company must be extremely well known before it can use initials successfully. Apparently the use of the initials “GE” triggers the words “General Electric” inside the brain.  
Invariably, people must know the name first before they will respond to initials. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service are extremely well known. So we respond instantly to FBI and IRS.
