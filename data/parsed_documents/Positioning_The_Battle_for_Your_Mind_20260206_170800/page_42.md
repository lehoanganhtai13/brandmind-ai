In the battle for the mind, the same thing often happens to the product that’s out of phase.  
Today a company can have a great product, a great sales force, a great advertising campaign and still fail miserably if it happens to be in a position in which “you can’t get there from here.” No matter how many millions it is prepared to spend.  
And the best example is what happened to RCA in the computer business.

**The handwriting on the wall**  
In 1969 we wrote an article for *Industrial Marketing* magazine using RCA as one of the prime examples. Entitled “Positioning Is a Game People Play in Today’s Me-Too Marketplace,” the article pulled no punches. It named names and made predictions, all based on the rules of a game called positioning. (It was the first time anyone had used the word “positioning” to describe the process of coping with the mental position that a larger, more established competitor occupies.)  
One prediction, in particular, turned out to be strikingly accurate. As far as the computer industry was concerned, we wrote, “A company has no hope to make progress head-on against the position that IBM has established.”  
The operative word, of course, was “head-on.” And while it’s possible to compete successfully with a market leader (the article suggested several approaches), the rules of positioning say it can’t be done “head-on.”  
Back in 1969 this raised a few eyebrows. Who were we to say that a powerful, multibillion-dollar company like RCA couldn’t find happiness in the computer business if it so desired?  
So as 1970 rolled around, it was full speed ahead at RCA. The incredible story was told in the pages of the business press.  
“RCA fires a broadside at No. 1,” said the headline of an article in the September 19, 1970, issue of *Business Week*.  
“RCA goes head-to-head with IBM,” said the headline of a news item in the October 1970 issue of *Fortune*.  
“RCA computer push is head-on slash at IBM,” said the headline of a story in the October 26, 1970, issue of *Advertising Age*.
