In other words, do what KLM had done for Amsterdam.  
Sabena had to make Belgium a place where a traveler would want to spend some time. Not a place you traveled through to get to somewhere else.  
Furthermore, there’s a moral here that shines through loud and clear. Whether you’re selling colas, companies, or countries. Out of mind, out of business.  
Most Americans knew very little about Belgium. They thought Waterloo was a suburb of Paris and the most important product of Belgium was waffles. Many didn’t even know where the country was.  
“If it’s Tuesday, this must be Belgium,” was the title of a popular motion picture.  
But how do you find a position for a country? Well, if you think about it, the most successful countries all have strong mental images.  
Say “England” and people think of pageantry, Big Ben, and the Tower of London.  
Say “Italy” and they think of the Coliseum and St. Peter’s and works of art.  
Say “Amsterdam” and it’s tulips, Rembrandt, and those wonderful canals.  
Say “France” and it’s food and the Eiffel Tower and the dazzling Riviera.  
Your mind sees cities and countries as mental picture postcards. In your mind, New York is probably a skyline of tall buildings. San Francisco is cable cars and the Golden Gate Bridge. Cleveland is a gray place with a lot of industrial smokestacks.  
Obviously, London, Paris, and Rome are all top-of-the-ladder destinations that are most popular with first-time travelers to Europe. Sabena had little chance to get these travelers.  
But in the United States there is a large segment of seasoned travelers looking to visit the next tier of destinations. Countries like Greece with its ruins. Switzerland with its mountains.  
Once the objective became clear, finding a position wasn’t that difficult.
