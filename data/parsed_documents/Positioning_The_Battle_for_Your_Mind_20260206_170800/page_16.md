What positioning is all about

How did a hard-sell concept like positioning become so popular in a
business noted for its creativity?
In truth, the past decade might well be characterized as a “return to
reality.” White knights and black eye patches gave way to such positioning
concepts as “Lite Beer from Miller. Everything you always wanted in a
beer. And less.”
Poetic? Yes. Artful? Yes. But also a straightforward, clearly defined
explanation of the basic positioning premise.
To be successful today, you must touch base with reality. And the only
reality that counts is what’s already in the prospect’s mind.
To be creative, to create something that doesn’t already exist in the
mind, is becoming more and more difficult. If not impossible.
The basic approach of positioning is not to create something new and
different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the
connections that already exist.
Today’s marketplace is no longer responsive to the strategies that
worked in the past. There are just too many products, too many companies,
and too much marketing noise.
The question most frequently asked by positioning skeptics is, “Why?”
Why do we need a new approach to advertising and marketing?

The overcommunicated society
The answer is that we have become an overcommunicated society. The per-
capita consumption of advertising in America today is $376.62 a year. (That
compares with $16.87 in the rest of the world.)
If you spend $1 million a year on advertising, you are bombarding the
average consumer with less than a half cent of advertising, spread out over
365 days—a consumer already exposed to $376.61½ worth of other
advertising.
