# Positioning a country: Belgium

With the advent of relatively inexpensive airfare, we’re fast becoming a world of tourists.  
In days gone by, international travel was limited to the older, more affluent person. Today that’s all changed. There was a time when the flight attendants were young and the travelers old. Now the travelers are young and the flight attendants are old.

## The Sabena situation

One of the many North Atlantic carriers jockeying for these international travelers is an airline called Sabena Belgian World Airlines. But all competitors don’t compete on an equal basis. TWA and Pan Am, for example, have for some time had a long list of gateway cities in both the United States and Europe.  
But Sabena flies nonstop from North America to only one city in Europe: Brussels. Unless there was a hijacker aboard, every Sabena plane was going to land in Belgium.  
While Sabena captured the lion’s share of the traffic to Belgium, they were on a very meager diet. Not too many people were flying to this little country. Only one out of 50 North Atlantic passengers fly to Belgium.  
On the country ladder in the prospective traveler’s mind, Belgium was on one of the bottom rungs. If it was on the ladder at all.  
One look at the situation and it was easy to tell what was wrong with Sabena’s advertising. Sabena was using classic airline strategy. Sell the food and the service.  
“Do I have to be a bon vivant to fly Sabena?” said a typical ad. But all the terrific food in the world won’t induce you to fly an airline that isn’t going where you want to go.

**Position the country, not the airline** Sabena’s most productive strategy was obviously not to position the airline but to position the country.
