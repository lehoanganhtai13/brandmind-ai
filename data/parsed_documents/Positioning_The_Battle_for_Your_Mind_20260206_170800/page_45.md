The problem is not what, but when, The extra effort, if it is going to be of much help, should be applied early to establish the precious posture of product leadership.  
With it, everything is possible. Without it, the going is going to be rough indeed. (As the Eskimo remarked, the lead dog is the only one who enjoys a change of view.)

## Smith and Jones at General Electric

One example might help illustrate the principle. Two gentlemen had their eyes on the top job at General Electric. One was named Smith. The other was named Jones.  
Smith was your typical “can do” corporate executive. So when he was given the computer operation to run, he accepted the assignment with relish.  
Jones, on the other hand, was realistic. He knew that GE hadn’t gotten into the computer business early enough to dominate it. At this late stage of the game, it was going to cost the company too much to catch up to IBM. If it ever could.  
After Smith failed to turn the computer business around, Jones got a chance to participate. He recommended that General Electric get out of the computer business, which it eventually did by selling the operation to Honeywell.  
That’s one reason why Reginald H. Jones wound up as chief executive of the General Electric Company. And J. Stanford Smith wound up at International Paper.  
In a nutshell, the hierarchy in the computer business is duplicated in almost every other industry. Invariably, every industry has a strong leader (IBM in computers, Xerox in copiers, and General Motors in automobiles) and a host of also-rans.  
If one can understand the role of positioning in the computer industry, then one can transfer this knowledge to almost any other situation.  
What works for computers will also work for cars and for colas.  
Or vice versa.
