**The sixth horse to ride is yourself.** There is one other horse. An animal that is mean, difficult, and unpredictable. Yet people often try to ride it. With very little success.  
That horse is yourself. It is possible to succeed in business or in life all by yourself. But it’s not easy.  
Like life itself, business is a social activity. As much cooperation as competition.  
Take selling, for example, You don’t make a sale all by yourself. Somebody also has to buy what you’re selling.  
So remember, the winningest jockeys are not necessarily the lightest, the smartest, or the strongest. The best jockey doesn’t win the race.  
The jockey that wins the race is usually the one with the best horse.  
So pick yourself a horse to ride and then ride it for all it’s worth.
