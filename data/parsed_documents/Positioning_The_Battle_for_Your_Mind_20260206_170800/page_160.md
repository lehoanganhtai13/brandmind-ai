If it wasn’t worthwhile doing, you shouldn’t have done it at all.  
On the other hand, if it is worthwhile doing and you wait until you can do it perfectly, if you procrastinate, you run the risk of not doing it. Ever.  
Therefore, anything worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.  
Your reputation will probably be better within the company if you try many times and succeed sometimes than if you fear failure and only try for sure things.  
People still remember Ty Cobb, who stole 96 bases out of 134 tries (70 percent). But they have forgotten Max Carey, who stole 51 bases out of 53 (96 percent).  
Eddie Arcaro, perhaps the greatest jockey who ever rode a horse, had 250 straight losers before he rode his first winner.  

**Make sure your name is right**  
Remember Leonard Slye? Few people did, until he changed his name to Roy Rogers, an important first step in becoming a motion picture star.  
How about Marion Morrison? A little feminine for a he-man cowboy, so he changed it to John Wayne.  
Or Issur Danielovitch? First changed to Isadore Demsky and then to Kirk Douglas.  
“Fate tried to conceal him,” said Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., “by naming him Smith.”  
Common law grants you the right to adopt any name you want as long as you’re not trying to defraud or be deceptive. So don’t change your name to McDonald and open up a hamburger stand.  
Also, if you’re a politician, don’t bother to change your name to “None of the Above.” Luther D. Knox, a candidate in a Louisiana gubernatorial primary, had his name legally changed to just that. However, a federal judge had Mr. None of the Above’s name taken off the ballot because the move was deceptive.  

**Avoid the no-name trap**  
Many business people fall victim to initialitus personally as well as corporately.
