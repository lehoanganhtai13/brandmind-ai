Try telling General Electric not to put the GE name on a new product and you’ll begin to appreciate the enormity of the corporate ego problem.)  
One reason why the principles of name selection remain so elusive is the Charles Lindbergh syndrome.  
If you get into the mind first, any name is going to work.  
If you didn’t get there first, then you are flirting with disaster if you don’t select an appropriate name.

**Divide and conquer**  
To illustrate the advantages of separate names rather than house names, compare the strategies of Procter & Gamble with those of Colgate-Palmolive.  
You’ll find many house names in the Colgate-Palmolive line. To name a few: Colgate toothpaste, Colgate toothbrushes, Palmolive Rapid Shave, Palmolive dishwashing liquid, Palmolive soap.  
You won’t find any house names in the Procter & Gamble lineup. Procter & Gamble carefully positions each product so that it occupies a unique niche in the mind. For example: Tide makes clothes “white.” Cheer makes them “whiter than white.” And Bold makes them “bright.”  
With fewer brands Procter & Gamble does twice as much business and makes five times as much profit as Colgate-Palmolive.  
While it’s fashionable on Madison Avenue these days to pooh-pooh Procter & Gamble advertising, it’s interesting to note that Procter & Gamble makes more money every year than all of America’s 6000 advertising agencies combined.

**A new product needs a new name**  
When a really new product comes along, it’s almost always a mistake to hang a well-known name on it.  
The reason is obvious. A well-known name got well known because it stood for something. It occupies a position in the prospect’s mind. A really well-known name sits on the top rung of a sharply defined ladder.  
The new product, if it’s going to be successful, is going to require a new ladder. New ladder, new name. It’s as simple as that.
