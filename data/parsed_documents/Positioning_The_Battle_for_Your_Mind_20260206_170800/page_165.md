To ride the “idea” horse, you must be willing to expose yourself to ridicule and controversy. You must be willing to go against the tide.  
You can’t be first with a new idea or concept unless you are willing to stick your neck out. And take a lot of abuse. And bide your time until your time comes.  
“One indication of the validity of a principle,” according to psychologist Charles Osgood, “is the vigor and persistence with which it is opposed.” “In any field,” says Dr. Osgood, “if people see that a principle is obvious nonsense and easy to refute, they tend to ignore it. On the other hand, if the principle is difficult to refute and it causes them to question some of their own basic assumptions with which their names may be identified, they have to go out of their way to find something wrong with it.”  
Never be afraid of conflict.  
Where would Winston Churchill have been without Adolf Hitler? We know the answer to that one. After Adolf Hitler was disposed of, at the very first opportunity the British public promptly turned Winston Churchill out of office.  
And you remember what Liberace said about the bad reviews one of his concerts received. “I cried all the way to the bank.”  
An idea or concept without an element of conflict is not an idea at all. It’s motherhood, apple pie, and the flag, revisited.  
**The fifth horse to ride is faith.** Faith in others and their ideas. The importance of getting outside of yourself, of finding your fortune on the outside, is illustrated by the story of a man who was a failure most of his life.  
His name was Ray Kroc, and he was a lot older than most people and a failure to boot when he met two brothers who changed his life.  
For the brothers had an idea, but no faith. So they sold their idea as well as their name to Ray Kroc for relatively few dollars.  
Ray Kroc became one of the richest people in America. Worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  
The brothers? They were the McDonald brothers, and every time you eat one of their hamburgers, remember it was the vision, courage, and persistence of the outsider who made the McDonald’s chain a success. Not two guys named McDonald.
