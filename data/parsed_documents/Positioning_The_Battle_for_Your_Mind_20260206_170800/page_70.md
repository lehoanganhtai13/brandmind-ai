The public and the press quickly corrupted the name to “Miller Lite,” and so Miller lost its right to exclusive use of “light” or its phonetic equivalent as a trademark for beer.

For years to come, trademark attorneys will be using Lite as an example of the danger of using descriptive words as trademarks. (Lawyers love coined names like Kodak and Xerox.)

Choosing a name is like driving a racing car. To win, you have to take chances. You have to select names that are almost, but not quite, generic. If once in a while you go off the track into generic territory, so be it. No world champion driver has made it to the top without spinning out a few times.

A strong, generic-like, descriptive name will block your me-too competitors from muscling their way into your territory. A good name is the best insurance for long-term success. *People* is a brilliant name for the gossip-column magazine. It’s a runaway success. The me-too copy, *Us* magazine, is in trouble.

**How not to choose a name**  
On the other hand. *Time* is not as good a name for a newsweekly as the more generic *Newsweek*.

*Time* was the first into the newsweekly pool and is an obvious success. But *Newsweek* isn’t far behind. (As a matter of fact, *Newsweek* sells more pages of advertising each year than does *Time*.)

Many people think *Time* is a great name for a magazine. And in a way, it is. Short, catchy, memorable. But it’s also subtle and tricky. (*Time* could be a trade magazine for the watch industry.)

*Fortune* is another name cut out of the same cloth. (*Fortune* could be a magazine for stockbrokers, commodity traders, or gamblers. It’s not clear.) *Business Week* is a much better name. Also a more successful magazine.

Names also get out of date, opening up creneaus for alert competitors.

*Esquire* was a great name for a magazine for the young-man-about-town. When young-men-about-town used to sign their names John J. Smith, Esq. But *Esquire* lost its leadership to *Playboy*. Everybody knows what a playboy is and what he’s interested in. Girls, right? But what’s an esquire? And what’s he interested in?

For many years, *Yachting* has been the leading publication in the marine field. But today how many esquires own yachts? So every year *Sail* *Magazine* keeps getting closer in sales to *Yachting*.
