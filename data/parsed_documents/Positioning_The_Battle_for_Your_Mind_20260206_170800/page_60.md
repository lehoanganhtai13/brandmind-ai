A multimillion-dollar failure. Volume had totaled just 100,000 cases, one-third of the company’s projections.

What went wrong? Look at the positioning claim from the prospect’s point of view.

The first white whisky? Not true. There are at least four others. Their names are gin, vodka, rum, and tequila.

As a matter of fact, Frost 8/80 ads encouraged the prospect to look at the new whisky as a substitute for other distilled spirits. According to the ads, Frost 8/80 could be used like vodka or gin in martinis, like scotch or bourbon in manhattans and whisky sours.

Don’t try to trick the prospect. Advertising is not a debate. It’s a seduction.

The prospect won’t sit still for the finer points of verbal logic. As the politician said, “If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, I say it’s a duck.”

## The everybody trap

Some marketing people reject the “cherchez le creneau” concept. They don’t want to be tied down to a specific position because they believe it limits their sales. Or their opportunities.

* They want to be all things to all people.

Years ago, when there were a lot fewer brands and a lot less advertising, it made sense to try to appeal to everybody.

In politics it used to be suicide for a politician to take a strong position on anything. Don’t step on anybody’s toes.

But today in the product arena and in the political arena, you have to have a position. There are too many competitors out there. You can’t win by not making enemies, by being everything to everybody.

To win in today’s competitive environment, you have to go out and make friends, carve out a specific niche in the market. Even if you lose a few doing so.

Today the everybody trap may keep you afloat if you’re already in office or already own a substantial share of market. But it’s deadly if you want to build a position from nowhere.
