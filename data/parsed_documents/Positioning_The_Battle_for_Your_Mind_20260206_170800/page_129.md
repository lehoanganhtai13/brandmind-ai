Effective, too. Our research shows that in terms of perceptions, Bermuda is second in desirability to the U.S. Virgin Islands. If it weren’t for the weather factor (Bermuda is considerably north of the other islands), Bermuda would have been in first place.

Jamaica’s positioning problem is similar to the problem of Belgium. How to put a mental picture postcard into the mind of the Caribbean prospect?

## The search for the postcard

The first approach is to sort through thousands of postcards to find the one perfect picture of the island of Jamaica. But it can’t be found.

There’s a good reason. If there were one image that captured the essence of the island, someone would have noticed it already and used it. In other words, there would have been an image already burned into at least a few minds.

The second approach is to visit Jamaica and shoot hundreds or thousands of pictures trying to capture that illusive mental picture postcard. Not surprisingly, nothing totally right turns up.

The third approach is the one that should have been used first. It’s to look into the mind of the prospect to see what mental images already exist. And then select one you can tie Jamaica into.

What is the verbal essence of Jamaica? An old advertisement said, “Jamaica is the big green island in the Caribbean that has deserted beaches, cool mountains, country pastures, open plains, rivers, rapids, waterfalls, ponds, good drinking water, and a jungly interior.”

Does that sound familiar? Does it remind you of a very popular tourist destination in the Pacific?

## The Hawaiian connection

That’s right. Hawaii. Most people have a mental picture of the big green volcanic mountains coming down to the blue sea.

It’s a view that you can also see as you approach the island of Jamaica, the Hawaii of the Caribbean.

The Hawaii of the Caribbean becomes an even more powerful concept when you compare Jamaica with its four biggest competitors. This chart lists the highest point of each destination.
