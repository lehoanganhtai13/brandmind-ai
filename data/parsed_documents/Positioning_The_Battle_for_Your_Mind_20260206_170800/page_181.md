Distribution is another roll-out technique. The Wella line was first sold through beauty salons. After the products were established, they were sold through drugstores and supermarkets.

### You need a global outlook  
Don’t overlook the importance of worldwide thinking. A company that keeps its eye on Tom, Dick, and Harry is going to miss Pierre, Hans, and Yoshio.  
Marketing is rapidly becoming a worldwide ballgame. A company that owns a position in one country now finds that it can use that position to wedge its way into another. IBM has some 60 percent of the German computer market. Is this fact surprising? It shouldn’t be. IBM earns more than 50 percent of its profits outside the United States.  
As companies start to operate on a worldwide basis, they often discover they have a name problem.  
A typical example is U.S. Rubber, a worldwide company that marketed many products not made of rubber. Changing the name to Uniroyal created a new corporate identity that could be used worldwide.

### What you don’t need  
You don’t need a reputation as a marketing genius. As a matter of fact, this could be a fatal flaw.  
All too often, the product leader makes the fatal mistake of attributing its success to marketing skill. As a result, it thinks it can transfer that skill to other products and other marketing situations.  
Witness, for example, the disappointing record of Xerox in computers.  
And the mecca of marketing knowledge, International Business Machines Corporation, hasn’t done much better. So far, IBM’s plain-paper copier hasn’t made much of a dent in Xerox’s business. Touché.  
The rules of positioning hold for all types of products. In the packaged-goods area, for example, Bristol-Myers tried to take on Crest toothpaste with Fact (killed after $5 million was spent on promotion). Then they tried to go after Alka-Seltzer with Resolve (killed after $11 million was spent).
