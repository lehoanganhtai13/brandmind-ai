# Positioning the Catholic Church

A farfetched idea?  
Not really. The essence of any religion is communication. From divinity to clergy to congregation.  
The problems arise not with a perfect divinity or an imperfect congregation but with the clergy.  
How the clergy applies communication theory to the practice of religion will have a major influence on the way religion affects the congregation.

## An identity crisis

Some years ago, positioning thinking was applied to the Catholic Church. In other words, communication problems of this enormous institution were treated as if they belonged to a major corporation.  
This request did not come from the Pope or a committee of bishops. It came from a group of laity who were deeply concerned about what one renowned theologian dubbed a “certain crisis of identity” that had followed in the wake of the reforms of Vatican II.  
It was quickly apparent that communication in the Catholic Church was haphazard at best.  
While much effort had been expended in improving techniques, the programs lacked a strong central theme or any continuity. (An especially serious problem in an era of electronic overcommunication.)  
It was like General Motors with no overall corporate advertising programs. All communication came from the local dealers. Some of it good, much of it bad.  
A large measure of the problems could be traced to Vatican II.  
Prior to that “opening of the windows,” the institutional Church had a clearly perceived position in the minds of the faithful. To most, the Church was the teacher of the law. Much emphasis was placed on rules, rewards, and punishment.
