This data presents a comparative analysis of several banks, ranked by a numerical "Score." Long Island Trust leads with a score of 7.0, followed closely by Chemical and Citibank, both achieving 6.7. National Bank of North America and Chase Manhattan are positioned next, with identical scores of 6.6. European American bank is at the lower end of this ranking, with a score of 6.4. The structure is a simple, ordered list, indicating a performance or rating comparison across these financial institutions.

Results were seen not only in the research but in the branches too. “With the assistance of the advertising agency which pioneered the widely accepted concept of positioning,” said the bank’s annual report, “our lead bank, Long Island Trust, assumed the mantle of the Long Island Bank for Long Islanders. Acceptance of the campaign was immediate and gratifying.”  

You might think that a bank promoting the area that it serves is an obvious idea. And it is.
