# The Toledo triplets

If the Akron twins seem confusing, consider the predicament of the Toledo triplets. Owens-Illinois, Owens-Corning Fiberglas and Libbey-Owens-Ford.

These are not small outfits either. Owens-Illinois is a $3.5 billion company. Owens-Corning Fiberglas is a $3 billion company. And Libbey-Owens-Ford is a $1.75 billion company.

Look at the confusion problem from the point of view of Owens-Corning Fiberglas.

Owens, of course, is usually connected with Illinois. Owens-Illinois is a larger company with a stronger claim to the Owens name.

And Corning is usually linked with glass. In nearby Corning, New York, is the Corning Glass Works, a $1.7 billion company. It has succeeded in firmly linking the Corning name to the glass concept.

So what’s left for Owens-Corning Fiberglas?  
Fiberglas.  
Which is probably why the company runs ads that say “Owens-Corning is Fiberglas.” In other words, if you want Fiberglas, you’ll just have to remember Owens-Corning.

It would be a lot easier if the company changed its name to the Fiberglas Corporation. Then if you want fiberglass (with a lowercase “f”), all you have to remember is Fiberglas (with an uppercase “F”). This step would help focus the attention on the company’s primary objective, to turn fiberglass from a generic name back into a brand name.

What should you do if your name is Hubert or Elmer or Eastern or Goodrich or Owens-Corning Fiberglas? Change it.

But name changing is rare, in spite of the logic. Most companies are convinced they have too much equity in their present name. “Our customers and employees would never accept a new name.”

What about Olin and Mobil and Uniroyal and Xerox? And how about Exxon Corporation? It was only a few years ago that Exxon changed its name from.…

Well, do you even remember what Exxon’s old name was? No, it wasn’t Esso and it wasn’t Humble Oil or Enjay, although the company did use these names in its marketing operations.
