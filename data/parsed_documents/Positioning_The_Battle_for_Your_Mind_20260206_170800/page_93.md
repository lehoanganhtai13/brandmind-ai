Xerox is more than a name. It’s a position. Like Kleenex, Hertz, and Cadillac, Xerox represents a position of enormous long-term value.  
It’s bad enough when someone tries to take your position away. It’s tragic when you do it to yourself.

## Anonymity is a resource  
One reason why companies keep looking for a free ride is that they underestimate the value of anonymity.  
In politics, in marketing, in life, anonymity is a resource, easily squandered by too much publicity.  
“You can’t beat somebody with a nobody,” goes the old political saying. But today you can.  
The rapid rise of a “nobody” like Gary Hart is proof that politics is a different game today. The old maxims are no longer valid.  
Richard Nixon may be the best-known political name in the world. But almost any nobody could beat him.  
Publicity is like eating. Nothing kills the appetite quite as much as a hearty meal. And nothing kills the publicity potential of a product or a person quite as much as a cover story in a national magazine.  
The media are constantly looking for the new and different, the fresh young face.  
In dealing with media, you must conserve your anonymity until you are ready to spend it. And then when you spend it, spend it big. Always keeping in mind that the objective is not publicity or communication for its own sake, but publicity to achieve a position in the prospect’s mind.  
An unknown company with an unknown product has much more to gain from publicity than a well-known company with an established product.  
“In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes,” Andy Warhol once predicted.  
When your 15 minutes arrive, make the most of every second.
