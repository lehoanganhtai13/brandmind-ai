All you cause is confusion among your audience.

To counter the widespread consumer acceptance of fair trade laws, the opposition tried to call it “price maintenance” legislation. It was many, many years before fair trade laws were repealed by the many states that had enacted them.

A better tactic is to turn the name around. That is to reposition the concept by using the same words to turn the meaning inside out. “Fair to the trade, but unfair to the consumer” is an example of this tactic.

Even better is to rename the opposition before the powerful name takes root. “Price manitenance” would probably have worked as a blocking strategy, but only early in the game. Another example of the importance of being first.

## David and Michael and Hubert and Elmer

In spite of the common belief that it’s “only a name,” there is a growing body of evidence that a person’s name plays a significant role in the game of life.

Two psychology professors, Dr. Herbert Harari and Dr. John W. McDavid, were trying to find out why elementary school students made fun of classmates with unusual names.

So they experimented with different names attributed to compositions supposedly written by fourth and fifth graders. Two sets of names, in particular, illustrate the principle.

There were two popular names (David and Michael) and two unpopular names (Hubert and Elmer) on some of the compositions. Each composition was given to a different group of elementary school teachers to grade. (The teachers that participated in the experiment had no reason to believe they weren’t grading ordinary school papers.)

Would you believe that compositions bearing the names of David and Michael averaged a letter grade higher than the same compositions attributed to Elmer and Hubert? “Teachers know from past experience,” say the professors, “that a Hubert or an Elmer is generally a loser.”

What about famous people with odd first names? Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stevenson, for example. Both losers to men with the popular names of Richard and Dwight.
