But HUD is not recognized nearly so quickly. Why? Because most people don’t know the Department of Housing and Urban Development. So if HUD wants to become better known, the department must first make the name Housing and Urban Development better known. Taking a shortcut by using only the initials HUD won’t help very much.

Similarly, General Aniline & Film was not a very well known company. When they changed their name to GAF, they made certain that they were never going to become very well known. Now that GAF has legally changed its name to initials, presumably there’s no way to expose the prospect to the original name.

Yet alphabet soup seems to be on the corporate menu of many companies today. They fail to think through the process of positioning themselves in the mind. So they fall victim to the fad of the day.

And, no question about it, today’s fad is “initialitus.” Look at RCA. Everyone knows that RCA stands for Radio Corporation of America. So the company could use the initials to trigger the “Radio Corporation of America” words buried deep inside the mind.

But now that RCA is legally RCA, what will happen next? Nothing. At least in the next decade or so. The words are already buried in the minds of millions of people. And they’ll stay there indefinitely.

But what about the next generation of prospects? What will they think when they see those strange initials, RCA?

Roman Catholic Archdiocese?

Positioning is like the game of life. A long-term proposition. Name decisions made today may not bear fruit until many, many years in the future.

**The mind works by ear**  
The primary reason name selection errors are so common is that executives live in an ocean of paper. Letters, memos, reports. Swimming in the Xerox sea, it’s easy to forget that the mind works aurally. To utter a word, we first translate the letters into sounds. Which is why beginners move their lips when they read.

When you were a child, you first learned to speak and then to read. And you learned to read slowly and laboriously by saying the words out loud as you forced your mind to connect the written word with the aural sound stored in the brain.
