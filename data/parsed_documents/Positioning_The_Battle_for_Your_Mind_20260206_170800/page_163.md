You can’t do it yourself. If your company is going nowhere, get yourself a new one. While you can’t always pick an IBM or a Xerox, you ought to be able to do considerably better than average.

Place your bets on the growth industries. Tomorrow-type products like computers, electronics, optics, communications.

And don’t forget that soft services of all types are growing at a much faster rate than hard products. So look at banks, leasing, insurance, medical, financial, and consulting service companies.

Don’t forget that your experience with yesterday-type products can blind you to opportunities in totally different product areas. And especially services.

And when you change jobs to join one of those tomorrow-type companies, don’t just ask how much they are going to pay you today.

Also ask how much they are likely to pay you tomorrow.

**The second horse to ride is your boss.** Ask yourself the same questions about your boss as you asked yourself about your company.

Is he or she going anywhere? If not, who is? Always try to work for the smartest, brightest, most competent person you can find.

If you look at biographies of successful people, it’s amazing to find how many crawled up the ladder of success right behind someone else. From their first assignment in some menial job to their last as president or CEO of a major company.

Yet some people actually like to work for incompetents. I suppose they feel that a fresh flower stands out better if it’s surrounded by wilted ones. They forget the tendency of top management to throw the whole bunch out if they become dissatisfied with an operation.

Two types of individuals come in looking for jobs.

* One is inordinately proud of his or her specialty. He or she will often say, “You people really need me around here. You’re weak in my specialty.”
* The other type says just the opposite. “You’re strong in my specialty. You do a terrific job, and I want to work with the best.”

Which type is more likely to get the job? Right. The latter person.

On the other hand, strange as it might seem, top management people see more of the other type. The person who wants to be an expert. Preferably with a big title and salary to match.
