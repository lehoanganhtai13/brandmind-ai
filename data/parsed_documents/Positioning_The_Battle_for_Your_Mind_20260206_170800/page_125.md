# Beautiful Belgium

Belgium is a beautiful country with many of the things that appeal to the seasoned European traveler. Like interesting cities, historical palaces, museums, and art galleries.

Oddly enough, many Belgian people don’t have a high opinion of their own country as a tourist attraction. That attitude is perhaps epitomized by a sign that used to be at the Brussels airport. Among other things it said,  
“Welcome to Belga country. Weather: mild, but rains 220 days a year, on average.”

As the result, Belgium’s favorite tourist strategy was to promote the central location of Brussels as a “gateway” city and the ease of getting somewhere else. Like London, Paris, and Rome. (If you want to visit New York, fly to Philadelphia because it’s close by.)

There’s an important lesson here. The perceptions of people living in a place are often different from those visiting it.

Many New Yorkers fail to see New York as a tourist attraction. They remember the garbage strikes and forget the Statue of Liberty. Yet New York attracts 16 million visitors a year who all want to see those “big buildings.”

## Three-star cities

But while “beautiful” was a good position, it wasn’t really enough as a tourist promotion theme. To position a country as a destination, you need attractions that will keep the traveler around for at least a few days.

Nobody considers Monaco much of a destination because its number one attraction, Monte Carlo, can be seen in an evening.

Obviously, size is an important factor. Big countries have lots of attractions. Small countries are at a disadvantage. (If the Grand Canyon ran through Belgium, you wouldn’t have much land left to look at.)

We found the answer to the overall positioning problem in one of those Michelin Guides. You may not know that Michelin rates cities as well as restaurants.

Michelin’s Benelux edition lists six three-star “worth a special journey” cities. Five were in Belgium: Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, and Tournai.
