Yes, it is a problem for Sears and not everyone who might want to buy the DieHard will be able to make the connection. But it’s better to establish a position in the prospect’s mind first and then worry about how to establish a retail connection later.  
In positioning, the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily the best strategy. The obvious name isn’t always the best name.  
Inside-out thinking is the biggest barrier to success. Outside-in thinking is the best aid.

## Two ways of looking at the name  
The consumer and the manufacturer see things in totally different ways.  
Would you believe that to the folks down in Atlanta, Coca-Cola is not a soft drink? To the manufacturer, Coca-Cola is a company, a brand name, an institution, and a great place to work.  
But to the consumer, Coca-Cola is a sweet, dark, carbonated beverage. What’s in the glass is Coke. It’s not a cola drink manufactured by a company called Coca-Cola.  
The tablets in a bottle of aspirin are Bayer. Not aspirin manufactured by a company called Bayer. (The company name, of course, is Sterling Drug, not Bayer. So Bayer nonaspirin could just as logically have been called Sterling nonaspirin.)  
The great strength of a generic brand name is this close identification with the product itself. In the consumer’s mind, Bayer is aspirin and every other aspirin brand becomes “imitation Bayer.”  
The Coca-Cola slogan, “The real thing,” capitalizes on the tendency of the prospect to put the first product into the mind on a pedestal and to treat the me-too products as somehow inferior to the original.  
If Coke or Kleenex or Bayer is not available or if other brands are cheap enough, then the prospect might buy something else. But Bayer would still own a strong position in the mind.  
But notice what happens when the same customer is asked to buy a product called “Bayer nonaspirin.” If Bayer is aspirin, how can Bayer also be nonaspirin?  
Bayer timed-release aspirin, Bayer decongestant cold tablets, Bayer nonaspirin pain reliever. Each extension of the Bayer line undercuts the brand’s aspirin position.
