      "content": "I began to realize some years ago that important steps needed to precede the four Ps. All good marketing planning must start with R, Research, before any of the Ps can be set.\n\nResearch reveals, among other things, that customers differ greatly in their needs, perceptions, and preferences. Therefore, customers must be classified into S, Segments.\n\nMost companies cannot serve all segments. A company must choose the segment that they can serve at a superior level. This is T, Targeting.\n\nNow there is one more step before 4P planning can take place. That is P, Positioning. This is the revolutionary concept that Al Ries and Jack Trout introduced in their now classic book, *Positioning*.\n\nPositioning is a revolutionary idea precisely because it cuts across the other four Ps. It informs each of the Ps and adds consistency to them. Ever since the 1972 series of *Advertising Age* articles on the subject by the two authors of this book, the discipline of marketing has never been the same.\n\nPositioning can affect the product. Volvo’s conscious decision to build safety features into its product set up the hugely successful “safety” position for the Volvo brand. In the process, a small company from Sweden became one of the world’s most powerful automobile brands. (And commanded a big price when the company was bought by Ford.)\n\nPositioning can affect the price of the product. Häagen-Dazs’s conscious decision to introduce a more expensive line of ice cream set up the “premium” ice cream position for the brand and made Häagen-Dazs one of the enduring marketing successes of the past several decades. (What Häagen-Dazs did at the high end, brands like Wal-Mart and Southwest Airlines did at the low end.)\n\nPositioning can affect the place the product is sold. Hanes, the leading department store brand of panty hose, developed a panty hose product specifically for supermarket distribution. The brand was called L’eggs and it was packaged in an eggshaped container. The “supermarket” panty hose position made the L’eggs brand an enormous success and ultimately the largest-selling panty hose brand in the country.",

Their “pizza, pizza” refrain became one of the most memorable advertising programs ever run and made the Little Caesars brand into the fastest-growing pizza chain.  \nThen, of course, Little Caesars dropped their “two-for-one” strategy and sales fell apart, an event that demonstrates not only the power of positioning, but also the difficulty of changing one’s position after it is established.  \nMarketing is not a static discipline. Marketing is a constantly changing discipline and positioning is one of those revolutionary changes that keeps the marketing field alive, interesting, exciting, and fascinating.  \nWhen you read this seminal book on the subject I think you will find that positioning is not only alive and well today, but also a powerful tool for creating and maintaining real differentiation in the marketplace.\n\n> Philip Kotler, Ph.D.  \n> *Kellogg Graduate School of Management*  \n> *Northwestern University* How often have you heard that bromide?",

No, that won’t work.”  \n“You turn around and drive for half a mile till you hit a stop sign, then turn right,” the farmer continued. “No, that won’t work either.” After a long pause, the farmer looked at the confused traveler and said, “You know what, son, you can’t get there from here!”  \nThat just happens to be the fate of many people, politicians, and products today. They happen to be in a position where “they can’t get there from here.”  \nAvis is not going to be No. 1. Wishing won’t make it so. And neither will massive amounts of advertising.\n\n## The “can do” spirit refuses to die  \nIn many ways our country’s Vietnam experience was a typical example of American “can do” spirit. Anything is possible if only you try hard enough. But no matter how hard we tried, no matter how many soldiers and how much money we poured in, the problem could not be solved by an outside force.  \nWe couldn’t get there from here.  \nIn spite of hundreds of Vietnam examples to the contrary, we live in a “can do” environment. Yet many things are not possible, no matter how hard you try.  \nTake the 55-year-old executive vice president who is never going to get the top job. When the chief executive retires in a few years at age 65, the board appoints a 48-year-old successor.  \nThe 55-year-old is out of phase for the president’s job. To have a chance for promotion, he or she must be at least a decade younger than the current holder.\n\nIn the battle for the mind, the same thing often happens to the product that’s out of phase.  \nToday a company can have a great product, a great sales force, a great advertising campaign and still fail miserably if it happens to be in a position in which “you can’t get there from here.” No matter how many millions it is prepared to spend.  \nAnd the best example is what happened to RCA in the computer business.",

      "content": "**The handwriting on the wall**  \nIn 1969 we wrote an article for *Industrial Marketing* magazine using RCA as one of the prime examples. Entitled “Positioning Is a Game People Play in Today’s Me-Too Marketplace,” the article pulled no punches. It named names and made predictions, all based on the rules of a game called positioning. (It was the first time anyone had used the word “positioning” to describe the process of coping with the mental position that a larger, more established competitor occupies.)  \nOne prediction, in particular, turned out to be strikingly accurate. As far as the computer industry was concerned, we wrote, “A company has no hope to make progress head-on against the position that IBM has established.”  \nThe operative word, of course, was “head-on.” And while it’s possible to compete successfully with a market leader (the article suggested several approaches), the rules of positioning say it can’t be done “head-on.”  \nBack in 1969 this raised a few eyebrows. Who were we to say that a powerful, multibillion-dollar company like RCA couldn’t find happiness in the computer business if it so desired?  \nSo as 1970 rolled around, it was full speed ahead at RCA. The incredible story was told in the pages of the business press.  \n“RCA fires a broadside at No. 1,” said the headline of an article in the September 19, 1970, issue of *Business Week*.  \n“RCA goes head-to-head with IBM,” said the headline of a news item in the October 1970 issue of *Fortune*.  \n“RCA computer push is head-on slash at IBM,” said the headline of a story in the October 26, 1970, issue of *Advertising Age*.\n\nAnd just to make sure there was no mistaking the company’s intentions, Robert W. Sarnoff, chairman and president, made a prediction that by the end of 1970, RCA would be in a “firm No. 2 position” in the computer industry. Pointing out that his company had already invested “far more to develop a strong position in the computer industry than we have ever put into any previous business venture,” including color TV, Mr. Sarnoff said that the goal had been development of a solid profit position in the early seventies.\n\n## The “can do” spirit dies\nLess than a year later, the roof fell in. “The $250 million disaster that hit RCA,” said the headline of a story in the September 25, 1971, issue of *Business Week.*",

Someone figured out that if you took that much money in one-hundred-dollar bills and put it on the sidewalk in Rockefeller Center, the stack would go right past Bob Sarnoff’s window on the 53rd floor of the RCA Building.\n\nThose were bad times for computer manufacturers. In May 1970, after years of unprofitable computer operations, General Electric threw in the sponge by selling the mess to Honeywell.\n\nWith two major computer manufacturers folding one right after another, the urge to say “I told you so” was irresistible. So later in the year 1971, we came back with “Positioning Revisited: Why Didn’t GE and RCA Listen?” (The article appeared in the November 1971 issue of *Industrial Marketing.*)\n\nHow do you advertise and market against a company like IBM? The two positioning articles made some suggestions.\n\n## How to go against an IBM\nThe computer business has often been referred to as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Snow White has established a position unrivaled in the history of marketing.\n\nIBM has 70 percent of the mainframe computer business vs. less than 10 percent for the largest of the dwarfs.\n\nHow do you go against a company with a position like IBM?\n\nWell, first you have to recognize it. Then you don’t do the thing that too many people in the computer field try to do. Act like IBM.\n\nA company has no hope to make progress head-on against the position that IBM has established. And history, so far, has proved this to be true.\n\nThe small companies in the field probably recognize this. But the big companies seem to think they can take their strong positions against IBM. Well, as one unhappy executive was heard to say, “There just isn’t enough money in the world.” You can’t get there from here.\n\n“Fight fire with fire” is the old cliché. But as the late Howard Gossage used to say, “That’s silly. You fight fire with water.”\n\nA better strategy for IBM’s competitors would be to take advantage of whatever positions they already own in the minds of their prospects and then relate them to a new position in computers. For example, how should RCA have positioned its computer line?",

      "content": "Our 1969 article made a suggestion: “RCA is a leader in communications. If they positioned a computer line that related to their business in communications, they could take advantage of their own position. Even though they would be ignoring a great deal of business, they would be establishing a strong beachhead.”\n\nTake General Electric, a company that is a big user of computers. Time sharing was the big technological topic of the day. If GE had concentrated on time-sharing computers, they too might have succeeded in the computer field. (Actually, the only computer operation General Electric didn’t sell to Honeywell was their time-sharing network, which remains profitable to this day.)\n\nTake NCR, a company with a strong position in cash registers.\n\nNCR has made great progress in the computer business by concentrating its efforts on retail data entry systems. Computerized cash registers, if you will.\n\nWhere the situation is hopeless, however, the effort in finding a valid position is probably wasted. Much better to concentrate on other areas of a company’s business. As Charlie Brown said, “No problem is too big to run away from.”\n\nIn truth, outright failure is often preferable to mediocre success.\n\nAn also-ran can easily be tempted to think that the answer to the problem is trying harder. A company stuck with a losing position is not going to benefit much from hard work.\n\nThe problem is not what, but when, The extra effort, if it is going to be of much help, should be applied early to establish the precious posture of product leadership.  \nWith it, everything is possible. Without it, the going is going to be rough indeed. (As the Eskimo remarked, the lead dog is the only one who enjoys a change of view.)\n\n## Smith and Jones at General Electric",

People seem to believe any problem can be solved if only the parties sit down and talk.\n\nUnlikely.\n\nToday, communication itself is the problem. We have become the world’s first overcommunicated society. Each year, we send more and receive less.\n\n## A new approach to communication\n\nThis book has been written about a new approach to communication called *positioning*. And most of the examples are from the most difficult of all forms of communication—advertising. A form of communication that, from the point of view of the recipient, is held in low esteem. Advertising is, for the most part, unwanted and unliked. In some cases, advertising is thoroughly detested.\n\nTo many intellectuals, advertising is selling your soul to corporate America—a subject not worthy of serious study.\n\nIn spite of its reputation, or perhaps because of it, the field of advertising is a superb testing ground for theories of communication. If it works in advertising, most likely it will work in politics, religion, or any other activity that requires mass communication.\n\nSo the examples in this book could just as well have been taken from the field of politics, war, business, or even the science of chasing the opposite sex. Or any form of human activity which involves influencing the minds of other people.\n\nWhether you want to promote a car, a cola, a computer, a candidate, or your own career.\n\nPositioning is a concept that has changed the nature of advertising, a concept so simple, people have difficulty understanding how powerful it is.\n\nEvery successful politician practices positioning. So do Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson.\n\n## Positioning defined\n\nPositioning starts with a product. A piece of merchandise, a service, a company, an institution, or even a person. Perhaps yourself.\n\nBut positioning is not what you do to a product. Positioning is what you do to the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.",

But changes made in the name, the price, and the package are really not changes in the product at all. They’re basically cosmetic changes done for the purpose of securing a worthwhile position in the prospect’s mind.\n\nPositioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the difficult problem of getting heard in our overcommunicated society.\n\n## How positioning got started\n\nIf one word can be said to have marked the course of advertising in the past decade, the word is “positioning.”\n\nPositioning has become a buzzword among advertising, sales, and marketing people. Not only in America, but around the world. Teachers, politicians, and editorial writers are using the word.\n\nMost people think positioning got started in 1972 when we wrote a series of articles entitled “The Positioning Era” for the trade paper *Advertising Age*.\n\nSince then, we have given more than 1000 speeches on positioning to advertising groups in 21 different countries around the world. And we have given away more than 150,000 copies of our “little orange booklet” which reprints the *Advertising Age* articles.\n\nPositioning has changed the way the advertising game is being played today.  \n“We’re the third largest-selling coffee in America,” say the Sanka radio commercials.  \nThe third largest? Whatever happened to those good old advertising words like “first” and “best” and “finest”?  \nWell, the good old advertising days are gone forever and so are the words. Today you find comparatives, not superlatives.  \n“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”  \n“Seven-Up: the uncola.”  \nAlong Madison Avenue, these are called positioning slogans. And the advertising people who write them spend their time and research money looking for positions, or holes, in the marketplace.  \nBut positioning has stirred up interest well beyond Madison Avenue. With good reason.  \nAnyone can use positioning strategy to get ahead in the game of life. And look at it this way: If you don’t understand and use the principles, your competitors undoubtedly will.",

Remember Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong?  \nYou just get there firstest with the mostest.\n\n## Establishing leadership\n\nHistory shows that the first brand into the brain, on the average, gets twice the long-term market share of the No. 2 brand and twice again as much as the No. 3 brand. And the relationships are not easily changed.  \nThe leader brand in category after category outsells the number two brand by a wide margin. Hertz outsells Avis, General Motors outsells Ford, Goodyear outsells Firestone, McDonald’s outsells Burger King, General Electric outsells Westinghouse.  \nMany marketing experts overlook the enormous advantages of being first. Too often they attribute successes like Kodak and IBM and Coke to “marketing acumen.”\n\n## The failures of leaders\n\nYet when the shoe is on the other foot, when a marketing leader isn’t first in a new category, the new product is usually an also-ran.  \nCoca-Cola is a gigantic company compared with Dr. Pepper. Yet when Coke introduced a competitive product, Mr. Pibb, even the immense resources of the Atlanta giant couldn’t put much of a dent in Dr. Pepper’s sales. Mr. Pibb remains a poor second.  \nIBM is a much bigger company than Xerox and has awesome resources of technology, work force, and money.

Far from it. Kodak managed to take only a small share, at the expense of a substantial loss in its conventional camera business.  \nAlmost all the advantages accrue to the leader. In the absence of any strong reasons to the contrary, consumers will probably select the same brand for their next purchase as they selected for their last purchase. Stores are more likely to stock the leading brands.  \nThe larger, more successful companies usually have the first pick of outstanding college graduates. In fact, they usually attract more and better employees.  \nAt almost every step of the way, the leading brand has the advantage.  \nOn an airplane flight, for example, the airline will often stock one brand of cola, one brand of ginger ale, one brand of beer, etc.  \nOn your next flight, see if the three brands aren’t Coke, Canada Dry, and Budweiser, the three leading brands of cola, ginger ale, and beer.\n\n## The instability of equality  \nIt’s true that in some categories the two leading brands run neck and neck.  \nWhat’s equally true is that these categories are inherently unstable. Sooner or later, you can expect one brand to get the upper hand and open a lead which eventually will reach a stable 5 to 3 or 2 to 1 ratio.  \nConsumers are like chickens. They are much more comfortable with a pecking order that everybody knows about and accepts.  \n* Hertz and Avis.  \n* Harvard and Yale.  \n* McDonald’s and Burger King.  \nWhen two brands are close, one or the other is likely to get the upper hand and then dominate the market for years to come.  \nBetween 1925 and 1930, for example, Ford and Chevrolet were locked in a head-to-head battle. Then Chevrolet took the lead in 1931.  \nIn the model years since, including dislocations caused by depression and wars, Chevrolet has lost the lead only four times to Ford.",

Winning the battle for sales leadership in a single year will often clinch the victory for decades to come.  \nIt takes 110 percent of rated power for a jet to get its wheels off the ground. Yet when it reaches 30,000 feet, the pilot can throttle back to 70 percent of power and still cruise at 600 miles per hour.\n\n## Strategies for maintaining leadership  \nQuestion: Where does the 800-pound gorilla sleep? Answer: Anywhere he wants to.  \nLeaders can do anything they want to. Short-term, leaders are almost invulnerable. Momentum alone carries them along. (Old wrestling expression: You can’t get pinned when you’re on top.)  \nFor General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and the leaders of this world, the worries are never about this year or next. Their worries are long-term. What’s going to happen 5 years from now? 10 years from now?  \nLeaders should use their short-term flexibility to assure themselves of a stable long-term future. As a matter of fact, the marketing leader is usually the one who moves the ladder into the mind with his or her brand nailed to the one and only rung. Once there, what should leaders do and not do?\n\n## What not to do  \nAs long as a company owns the position, there’s no point in running advertisements that repeat the obvious. “We’re No. 1” is a typical example.  \nMuch better is to enhance the product category in the prospect’s mind. IBM’s advertising usually ignores competition and sells the value of computers. All computers, not just the company’s types.  \nWhy isn’t it a good idea to run advertising that says, “We’re No. 1”?  \nThe reason is psychological. Either the prospect knows you are No. 1 and wonders why you are so insecure that you have to say so. Or the prospect doesn’t know you are No. 1. If not, why not?  \nMaybe you have defined your leadership in your own terms and not the prospect’s terms. Unfortunately, that just won’t work.  \nYou can’t build a leadership position on your own terms. “The best-selling under-$1000 high-fidelity system east of the Mississippi.” You have to build a leadership position in the prospect’s terms.",

The essential ingredient in keeping that position is reinforcing the original concept. Coca-Cola is the standard by which all others are judged. In contrast, everything else is an imitation of “the real thing.”  \nThis is not the same as saying “We’re No. 1.” The largest brand could be the largest seller because it has a lower price, it is available in more outlets, etc.  \nBut “the real thing,” like a first love, will always occupy a special place in the prospect’s mind.  \n“We invented the product.” A powerful motivating force behind Xerox copiers. Polaroid cameras. Zippo lighters.\n\n## Covering all bets\nUnfortunately, leaders often read their own advertising so avidly they end up thinking they can do no wrong. So when a competitor introduces a new product or a new feature, the tendency is to pooh-pooh the development.  \nLeaders should do the opposite. They should cover all bets. This means a leader should swallow his or her pride and adopt every new product development as soon as it shows signs of promise.  \nGeneral Motors spent $50 million to cover the Wankel engine when it was offered to the automotive industry. Money down the drain? Not necessarily.  \nGeneral Motors probably looks on the $50 million spent to buy a Wankel license as cheap insurance to protect an $84 billion-a-year business.  \nSuppose the Wankel had become the automotive engine of the future. And Ford or Chrysler had been the first to buy the rights. Where would General Motors be now?  \nRight where Kodak and 3M are in office copiers. When these two leaders in coated-paper copiers had a chance to cover by buying rights to Carlson’s xerography process, they declined.",

      "content": "“Nobody would pay 5 cents for a plain-paper copy when they could get a coated-paper copy for a cent and a half.” Logical enough. But the essence of covering is protection against the unexpected.  \nAnd the unexpected did happen. Haloid took a chance on the Carlson patents, and today the company (successively Haloid Xerox and then Xerox) is a $9 billion giant. Bigger than 3M and only a step behind Kodak. *Fortune* calls the Xerox 914 plain-paper copier “probably the single most profitable product ever manufactured in the United States.”  \nAnd what did Xerox do for an encore?  \nAlmost nothing. The spectacular success of the 914 was followed by one failure after another. Most notably in computers.\n\n### Power from the product  \n“Only when our office copying success has been repeated, not once, but several times,” said the Xerox chairman early on in the company’s diversification game, “can we fairly reach the conclusion that this organization has the kind of power that can be relied upon again and again.”  \nThis is the classic mistake made by the leader. The illusion that the power of the product is derived from the power of the organization.  \nIt’s just the reverse. The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect’s mind.  \nCoca-Cola has power. The Coca-Cola Company is merely a reflection of that power.  \nOutside the cola field, the Coca-Cola Company has to earn its power the hard way—either by getting into the mind first, by establishing a strong alternative position, or by repositioning the leader.  \nSo Coca-Cola’s Mr. Pibb runs a poor second to Dr. Pepper, and all the power of the Coca-Cola Company can’t do much about it.  \nSo, too, with Xerox. The power is in the position that Xerox owns in the mind. Xerox means copier. Xerox owns the copier position because it got into the mind first and then exploited that copier position by a massive marketing program.  \nBut in computers, office duplicators, word processors, and other products, Xerox starts at ground zero. Xerox has obviously tried to duplicate its copier success in other fields.\n\nBut it has apparently forgotten one essential element of the 914 program. It was the first to fly the plain-paper copier ocean.",

      "content": "## Covering with multibrands\nMost leaders should cover competitive moves by introducing another brand. This is the classic “multibrand” strategy of Procter & Gamble.\n\nIt may be a misnomer to call it a multibrand strategy. Rather it’s a single-position strategy.\n\nEach brand is uniquely positioned to occupy a certain location in the mind of the prospect. When times change, when new products come and go, no effort is made to change the position. Rather a new product is introduced to reflect changing technologies and changing tastes.\n\nIn other words, Procter & Gamble recognizes the enormous difficulty of moving an established position. When you have one already established, why change it? It may be cheaper and more effective in the long run to introduce a new product. Even if you eventually have to kill off an old, established name.\n\nIvory was a soap. It still is. When heavy-duty laundry detergents became available, the pressure was probably on to introduce Ivory Detergent. But this would have meant changing the position of Ivory in the prospect’s mind.\n\nA much better solution was Tide. Now the new detergent concept had a new name to match. And Tide became an enormous success.\n\nAnd when Procter & Gamble introduced a dishwasher detergent, they didn’t call it Dishwasher Tide. They called it Cascade.\n\nEach leading Procter & Gamble brand has its own separate identity: Joy, Crest, Head & Shoulders, Sure, Bounty, Pampers, Comet, Charmin, and Duncan Hines. Not a Plus, Ultra, or Super in the lot.\n\nSo a multibrand strategy is really a single-position strategy. One without change. Ivory has been going strong for 99 years.\n\n## Covering with a broader name\nWhat dethrones a leader, of course, is change.\n\nThe New York Central Railroad was not only the leading railroad in the twenties, it was also the bluest of blue-chip stocks. Several mergers later, the Penn Central (as it is called today) is an anemic relic with scarcely a trace of its former glory.\n\nAmerican Airlines, on the other hand, is flying high.\n\nThe covering move for the New York Central, of course, would have been to open an airline division at an early stage in the game.\n\n“What? You want us to start an airline to take business away from our railroad? Over my dead body we will.”",

Management often sees the new product or service as a competitor rather than as an opportunity.\n\nSometimes a name change will help bridge the gap from one era to the next. By broadening the name, you can allow the company to make the mental transition.\n\n*Sales Management* changed its name to *Sales & Marketing Management* to encompass the fast-growing function of marketing. At some point in the future the publication could drop the other shoe and change again. To *Marketing Management*.\n\nFrom Haloid to Haloid Xerox to Xerox is the general pattern.\n\nYou know, of course, how the Kodak Company got its name. From Eastman to Eastman Kodak to Kodak, right?\n\nWell, they haven’t dropped the other shoe yet. So the official name is still the Eastman Kodak Company.\n\nThe Direct Mail Association changed its name a number of years ago to Direct Mail-Marketing Association—a recognition of the fact that mail was only one of the ways for a company to do direct marketing.\n\nSo recently they changed again, to the Direct Marketing Association.\n\nWhile a New York Central Transportation Company might not have been a success either, there is plenty of evidence to indicate that people take names very literally. (Eastern Airlines, for example.)\n\nGovernment agencies are usually very good at the game of broadening the name. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example. (It used to be the Housing and Home Finance Agency.) By broadening the name, a government agency can enlarge its scope of operations, increase its staff, and naturally justify a larger budget.\n\nOddly enough, one agency that missed a bet was the Federal Trade Commission. A broader name would be Consumer Protection Agency, a name that would also take advantage of a current hot topic.\n\nLeaders can also benefit by broadening the range of applications for their products. Arm & Hammer has done a good job in promoting the use of baking soda in the refrigerator.\n\nThe Florida Citrus Commission promotes orange juice, the largest-selling fruit drink, for lunch snacks, with meals, etc. “It isn’t just for breakfast anymore,” say the commercials.\n\n*Business Week*, the leading business magazine, has successfully promoted itself as a good publication for consumer advertising. Today roughly 40 percent of its advertising volume is in consumer products.",

It’s a mind. An innocent mind. A mind that has not been burnished by someone else’s brand.  \nWhat’s true in business is true in nature too.  \n“Imprinting” is the term animal biologists use to describe the first encounter between a newborn animal and its natural mother. It takes only a few seconds to fix indelibly in the memory of the young animal the identity of its parent.  \nYou might think all ducks look alike, but even a day-old duckling will always recognize its mother, no matter how much you mix up the flock.  \nWell, that’s not quite true. If the imprinting process is interrupted by the substitution of a dog or cat or even a human being, the duckling will treat the substitute as its natural mother. No matter how different the creature looks.  \nFalling in love is a similar phenomenon. While people are more selective than ducks, they’re not nearly as selective as you might think.  \nWhat counts most is receptivity.

Xerox and Polaroid, to name two.\n\n## The positioning era\n\nToday it has become obvious that advertising is entering a new era—an era where creativity is no longer the key to success.\n\nThe fun and games of the sixties and seventies have given way to the harsh realities of the eighties.\n\nTo succeed in our overcommunicated society, a company must create a position in the prospect’s mind, a position that takes into consideration not only a company’s own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.\n\nAdvertising is entering an era where strategy is king. In the positioning era, it’s not enough to invent or discover something. It may not even be necessary. You must, however, be first to get into the prospect’s mind.  \nIBM didn’t invent the computer. Sperry-Rand did. But IBM was the first company to build a computer position in the mind of the prospect.",

Christopher Columbus made the mistake of looking for gold and keeping his mouth shut.  \nAmerigo Vespucci didn’t. The IBM of the fifteenth century, Amerigo was 5 years behind Christopher. But he did two things right.  \nFirst, he positioned the New World as a separate continent, totally distinct from Asia. This caused a revolution in the geography of his day.  \nSecond, he wrote extensively of his discoveries and theories. Especially significant are the five letters of his third voyage. One (Mundus Novus) was translated into 40 different languages over a 25-year period.  \nBefore he died, Spain granted him Castilian citizenship and gave him a major state post.  \nAs a result, the Europeans credited Amerigo Vespucci with the discovery of America and named the place after him.  \nChristopher Columbus died in jail.\n\n## What Michelob discovered  \nThe great copywriters of yesterday, who have gone to the big ad agency in the sky, would die all over again if they saw some of the campaigns currently running.  \nTake beer advertising, for example. In the past a beer copywriter looked closely at the product to find a copy platform. And he or she found product features like “real-draft” Piels and “cold-brewed” Ballantine.  \nAnd even further back a beer copywriter searched for just the right words to paint a picture of quality, taste, and appetite appeal.  \n“Just a kiss of the hops.”  \n“From the land of sky blue waters.” Today, however, poetry in advertising is as dead as poetry in poetry.\n\nOne of the biggest advertising successes of recent times is the campaign for Michelob. The brand was launched with a campaign that is as poetic as a stop sign. And just as effective.  \n“First class is Michelob” positioned the brand as a premium-priced American-made beer. In a few years, Michelob became one of the largest-selling beers in the United States. At premium prices too.  \nWas Michelob the first premium-priced domestic beer? No, of course not. But Michelob was the first to build the position in the beer-drinker’s mind.",

No, the Schlitz slogan made as much sense to the Joe Sixpacks of this world as the lyrics in an Italian opera.  \nBut over at the Miller Brewing Company, they apparently asked themselves what would happen if they really positioned a beer as a light beer.  \nSo Miller introduced “Lite” beer. And the rest is history. A runaway success that spawned a host of me-too brands. Including, ironically, Schlitz Light. (Presumably to be promoted as: “Real gusto in a great, light, light beer.”)  \nFor many people or products today, one roadway to success is to look at what your competitors are doing and then subtract the poetry or creativity which has become a barrier to getting the message into the mind. With a purified and simplified message, you can then penetrate the prospect’s mind.  \nFor example, there’s an imported beer whose positioning strategy is so crystal-clear that those old-time beer copywriters probably wouldn’t even accept it as advertising.  \n“You’ve tasted the German beer that’s the most popular in America. Now taste the German beer that’s the most popular in Germany.” This is how Beck’s beer effectively positioned itself against Lowenbrau.\n\nAdvertising like this made Beck’s beer popular in America too. Sales  \nkept going up year after year. Lowenbrau, on the other hand, gave up the  \nstruggle and became a domestic brand.  \nStrange things have been happening in American advertising. It’s  \nbecoming less poetic—and more effective.",

Our extravagant use of communication to solve a host of business and social problems has so jammed our channels that only a tiny fraction of all messages actually gets through. And not necessarily the most important ones either.\n\n## The transmission traffic jam\n\nTake advertising, for example. With only 6 percent of the world’s population, America consumes 57 percent of the world’s advertising. (And you thought our use of energy was extravagant. Actually, we consume only 33 percent of the world’s energy.)  \nAdvertising, of course, is only a small channel in the communication river.  \nTake books. Each year some 30,000 books are published in America. Every year another 30,000. Which doesn’t sound like a lot until you realize it would take 17 years of reading 24 hours a day just to finish one year’s output.  \nWho can keep up?  \nTake newspapers. Each year American newspapers use more than 10 million tons of newsprint. Which means that the average person consumes 94 pounds of newsprint a year.  \nThere’s some question whether the average person can digest all this information. The Sunday edition of a large metropolitan newspaper like *The New York Times* weighs about 4½ pounds and contains some 500,000 words. To read it all, at an average reading speed of 300 words per minute, would take almost 28 hours. Not only would your Sunday be shot, but also a good part of the rest of the week too.  \nHow much is getting through?\n\nTake television. A medium barely 35 years old. A powerful and pervasive medium, television didn’t replace radio or newspapers or magazines. Each of the three older media is bigger and stronger than it ever was.\n\nTelevision is an additive medium. And the amount of communication added by television is *awesome*.\n\nNinety-eight percent of all American homes have at least one television set. (A third have two or more.)\n\nNinety-six percent of all television households can receive four or more TV stations. (A third can receive ten or more.)\n\nThe average American family watches television more than 7 hours a day. (More than 51 hours a week.)",

Which means the average American family is exposed to some 750,000 television pictures a day.\n\nNot only are we being pictured to death, we are being papered to death. Take that Xerox machine down the hall. American business processes 1.4 trillion pieces of paper a year. That’s 5.6 billion every working day.\n\nDown the halls at the Pentagon, copy machines crank out 350,000 pages a day for distribution throughout the Defense Department. Equal to 1000 good-sized novels.\n\n“World War II will end,” said Field Marshal Montgomery, “when the warring nations run out of paper.”\n\nTake packaging. An 8-ounce package of Total breakfast cereal contains 1268 words of copy on the box. Plus an offer for a free booklet on nutrition. (Which contains another 3200 words.)\n\nThe assault on the mind takes place in many different ways.

They recognized Mr. Clean, even though he hadn’t been seen on television in 10 years, which shows the power of advertising to register a simple message.  \nWhat do you know about Ted Kennedy? Probably a lot more than you know about George Bush. And probably enough to keep him from being the next President of the United States.  \nAt best, communication in an overcommunicated society is difficult.

Generally speaking, anything that moves today is carrying a “message from our sponsor.”  \nEven the human body has become a walking billboard for Adidas, Gucci, Benetton, and Gloria Vanderbilt.  \nTake advertising again. Just after World War II, the percapita consumption of advertising in the United States was about $25 a year.\n\nToday it’s 15 times as much. (Inflation accounts for part of this increase, but volume is also up substantially.)\n\nDo you know 15 times as much about the products you buy? You may be exposed to much more advertising, but your mind can’t absorb any more than it used to. There’s a finite limit to how much you can take in, and advertising, even at $25 a year, was already way over the limit. That 1-quart container that sits on top of your neck can hold just so much.",

And five times as much as the average French person.\n\nWhile no one doubts the advertiser’s financial ability to dish it out, there’s some question about the consumer’s mental ability to take it all in.\n\nEach day, thousands of advertising messages compete for a share of the prospect’s mind. And make no mistake about it, the mind is the battleground. Between 6 inches of gray matter is where the advertising war takes place. And the battle is rough, with no holds barred and no quarter given.\n\nAdvertising is a brutal business where mistakes can be costly. But out of the advertising wars, principles have been developed to help you cope with our overcommunicated society.\n\n**The product explosion**  \nAnother reason our messages keep getting lost is the number of products we have invented to take care of our physical and mental needs.\n\nTake food for example. The average supermarket in the United States has some 12,000 individual products or brands on display. For the consumer, there’s no relief in sight. In fact, the product explosion could get worse. In Europe they are building super-supermarkets (called hypermarkets) with room for several times as many products. Biggs in Cincinnati, the first hypermarket in America, stocks 60,000 products.\n\nThe packaged-goods industry obviously expects the proliferation to continue. Those scratch marks on the side of most grocery boxes, the Universal Product Code, represent 10 digits. (Your social security number has only 9. And the system is designed to handle more than 200 million people.) And this same situation holds in the industrial field.\n\nThe Thomas Register, for example, lists 80,000 companies. There are 292 manufacturers of centrifugal pumps, 326 builders of electronic controls, to take two categories at random.\n\nThere are half a million active trademarks registered at the U.S. Patent Office. And 25,000 new ones get added every year. (Hundreds of thousands of products are sold without trademarks too.)\n\nIn a typical year, the 1500 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange introduce more than 5000 “significant” new products. And presumably a lot more than that were insignificant. Not to mention the millions of products and services marketed by America’s 5 million other corporations.",

While many of these are specialized and used almost exclusively by medical specialists, the general practitioner still has a herculean job to keep informed about the multitude of drug products available.\n\nHerculean? No, it’s an impossible job. Even Hercules himself could not have kept up with more than a small fraction of these drugs. To expect more is to be totally ignorant of the finite capacity of even the most brilliant mind.\n\nAnd how does the average person cope with the product and media explosions? Not very well. Studies on the sensitivity of the human brain have established the existence of a phenomenon called “sensory overload.”\n\nScientists have discovered that a person is capable of receiving only a limited amount of sensation. Beyond a certain point, the brain goes blank and refuses to function normally. (Dentists have been toying with some of these discoveries. Earphones are placed on the patient, and the sound level is turned up until the sensation of pain no longer is felt.)\n\n## The advertising explosion\n\nIronically, as the effectiveness of advertising goes down, the use of it goes up. Not just in volume, but in the number of users.\n\nDoctors, lawyers, dentists, accountants are dipping their toes into the advertising pool. Even institutions like churches, hospitals, and government have begun to advertise. (In a recent year the U.S. government spent $228,857,200 on advertising.) Professional people used to consider advertising beneath their dignity.\n\nBut as competition heats up, lawyers, dentists, optometrists, accountants, and architects are starting to promote themselves.  \nCleveland-based Hyatt Legal Services is spending $4.5 million a year on television advertising. Jacoby & Meyers is another big legal advertiser.  \nAdvertising is likely to start soon in the medical profession for a simple reason: Our overcommunicated society is in the process of becoming an overmedicated one too. A study for the Department of Health and Human Services predicts a surplus of about 70,000 doctors by 1990.  \nHow will these excess doctors find patients to practice on? By advertising, of course.  \nBut the professionals who are opposed to advertising say it downgrades their profession. And it does. To advertise effectively today, you have to get off your pedestal and put your ear to the ground. You have to get on the same wavelength as the prospect.",

In operation, the mind is a lot like a computer.  \nBut there is one important difference. A computer has to accept what you put into it. The mind does not. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.  \nThe mind rejects new information that doesn’t “compute.” It accepts only that new information which matches its current state of mind. It filters out everything else.\n\n## You see what you expect to see\n\nTake any two abstract drawings. Write the name Schwartz on one and the name Picasso on the other. Then ask someone for an opinion. You see what you expect to see.  \nAsk two people of opposite persuasion, say, a Democrat and a Republican, to read an article on a controversial subject. Then ask each one if the article changed his or her opinion.  \nYou’ll find that the Democrat gets out of the article facts to support one point of view. The Republican gets out of the same article facts to support the opposite point of view. Very little mind changing takes place. You see what you expect to see.  \nPour a bottle of Gallo into an empty 50-year-old bottle of French Burgundy. Then carefully decant a glass in front of a friend and ask for an opinion.  \nYou taste what you expect to taste.  \nBlind taste testings of champagne have often ranked inexpensive California brands above French ones. With the labels on, this is unlikely to happen.  \nYou taste what you expect to taste.\n\nWere it not so, there would be no role for advertising at all. Were the average consumer rational instead of emotional, there would be no advertising. At least not as we know it today.\n\nOne prime objective of all advertising is to heighten expectations. To create the illusion that the product or service will perform the miracles you expect. And presto, that’s exactly what the advertising does.\n\nBut create the opposite expectation and the product is in trouble. The introductory advertising for Gablinger’s beer created a feeling that because it was a diet product, it would taste bad.",

Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the Seven Wonders of the World, seven-card stud, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nAsk someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given product category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. For low-interest products, the average consumer can usually name no more than one or two brands.\n\nTry listing all ten of the Ten Commandments. If that’s too difficult, how about the seven danger signals of cancer? Or the four horsemen of the Apocalypse?\n\nIn one newspaper survey, 80 out of 100 Americans couldn’t name a single member of the President’s Cabinet.\n\nIf our mental storage bowl is too small to handle questions like these, how in the world are we going to keep track in our mind of all those brand names which have been multiplying like rabbits over the years?\n\nThirty years ago the six leading cigarette companies between them offered the American smoker 17 different brands. Today they sell more than 175. (A vending machine built to hold all these brands would have to be 30 feet long.)\n\n“Modelitus” has struck every industry, from automobiles to beer to zoom lenses. Detroit currently sells 290 different models in a bewildering variety of styles and sizes. Caravelle, Capri, Cimarron, Camaro, Calais, Cutlass. Let’s see, is it a Chevrolet Caravelle or a Plymouth Caravelle? The public is confused.\n\nTo cope with complexity, people have learned to simplify everything.\n\nWhen asked to describe an offspring’s intellectual progress, a person doesn’t usually quote vocabulary statistics, reading comprehension, mathematical ability, etc. “He’s in seventh grade” is a typical reply.",

      "content": "This ranking of people, objects, and brands is not only a convenient method of organizing things but also an absolute necessity to keep from being overwhelmed by the complexities of life.\n\n## The product ladder\n\nTo cope with the product explosion, people have learned to rank products and brands in the mind. Perhaps this can best be visualized by imagining a series of ladders in the mind. On each step is a brand name. And each different ladder represents a different product category.\n\n* Some ladders have many steps. (Seven is many.) Others have few, if any.\n* A competitor that wants to increase its share of the business must either dislodge the brand above (a task that is usually impossible) or somehow relate its brand to the other company’s position.\n* Yet too many companies embark on marketing and advertising programs as if the competitor’s position did not exist. They advertise their products in a vacuum and are disappointed when their messages fail to get through.\n* Moving up the ladder in the mind can be extremely difficult if the brands above have a strong foothold and no leverage or positioning strategy is applied.\n* An advertiser who wants to introduce a new product category must carry in a new ladder. This, too, is difficult, especially if the new category is not positioned against the old one. The mind has no room for what’s new and different unless it’s related to the old.\n\nThat’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is.  \nThe first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.  \nWords like “off-track” betting, “lead-free” gasoline, and “sugar-free” soda are all examples of how new concepts can best be positioned against the old.",

      "content": "## The “against” position  \nIn today’s marketplace the competitor’s position is just as important as your own. Sometimes more important. An early success in the positioning era was the famous Avis campaign.  \nThe Avis campaign will go down in marketing history as a classic example of establishing the “against” position. In the case of Avis, this was a position against the leader.  \n“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”  \nFor 13 years in a row, Avis lost money. Then they admitted that they were No. 2 and Avis started to make money.  \nThe first year Avis made $1.2 million. The second year, $2.6 million. The third year, $5 million. Then the company was sold to ITT.  \nAvis was able to make substantial gains because they recognized the position of Hertz and didn’t try to attack them head-on.  \nTo better understand why the Avis program was so successful, let’s look into the mind of the prospect and imagine we can see a product ladder marked “rent-a-cars.”  \nOn each rung of the product ladder is a brand name. Hertz on top. Avis on the second rung. National on the third.  \nMany marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder.  \nNot at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to Hertz. (If trying harder were the secret of success, Harold Stassen would have been President many times over.)  \nAs an indication of how far the advertising business has come in its acceptance of comparative ads, *Time* magazine originally rejected the “We try harder” line as being too competitive with Hertz.\n\nOther magazines followed the *Time* lead.\n\nSo the account executive panicked and agreed to change the line to “We try damned hard.” (A curse word presumably being less offensive than a comparative word.)\n\nOnly after the ad was canceled did *Time* change its mind and agree to accept the original version. (The account executive was fired.)\n\nEstablishing the “against” position is a classic positioning maneuver. If a company isn’t the first, then it has to be the first to occupy the No. 2 position. It’s not an easy task.\n\nBut it can be done. What Avis is doing in rent-a-cars, Burger King is doing in fast foods, and Pepsi is doing in colas.\n\n## The “uncola” position",

The brilliance of this idea can only be appreciated when you comprehend the enormous share of mind enjoyed by Coke and Pepsi. Almost two out of every three soft drinks consumed in the United States are cola drinks.\n\nBy linking the product to what was already in the mind of the prospect, the “uncola” position established 7-Up as an alternative to a cola drink. (The three rungs on the cola ladder might be visualized as: One, Coke. Two, Pepsi, And three, 7-Up.)\n\nTo prove the universality of positioning concepts, McCormick Communications took beautiful-music radio station WLKW, an also-ran in the Providence (Rhode Island) market, and made it number one. Their theme: WLKW, the unrock station.\n\nTo find a unique position, you must ignore conventional logic. Conventional logic says you find your concept inside yourself or inside the product.\n\nNot true. What you must do is look inside the prospect’s mind.\n\nYou won’t find an “uncola” idea inside a 7-Up can. You find it inside the cola drinker’s head.\n\n## The F.W.M.T.S. trap More than anything else, successful positioning requires consistency.\n\nYou must keep at it year after year.\n\nYet after a company has executed a brilliant positioning coup, too often it falls into what we call the F.W.M.T.S. trap: “Forgot what made them successful.”\n\nShortly after the company was sold to ITT, Avis decided it was no longer satisfied with being No. 2. So it ran ads saying, “Avis is going to be No. 1.”\n\nThat’s advertising your aspirations. Wrong psychologically. And wrong strategically.\n\nAvis was not destined to be No. 1 unless it could find a weakness in Hertz to exploit.\n\nFurthermore, the old campaign not only related No. 2 Avis to No. 1 Hertz on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, but also capitalized on the natural sympathy people have for the underdog.\n\nThe new campaign was just conventional brag-and-boast advertising.\n\nBe honest. In the last 20 years, Avis has run many different advertising campaigns: “The wizard of Avis.” “You don’t have to run through airports.”\n\nBut what is the single theme that leaps into your mind when someone mentions Avis?",

Everything you always wanted in a\nbeer. And less.”\nPoetic? Yes. Artful? Yes. But also a straightforward, clearly defined\nexplanation of the basic positioning premise.\nTo be successful today, you must touch base with reality. And the only\nreality that counts is what’s already in the prospect’s mind.\nTo be creative, to create something that doesn’t already exist in the\nmind, is becoming more and more difficult. If not impossible.\nThe basic approach of positioning is not to create something new and\ndifferent, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the\nconnections that already exist.\nToday’s marketplace is no longer responsive to the strategies that\nworked in the past. There are just too many products, too many companies,\nand too much marketing noise.\nThe question most frequently asked by positioning skeptics is, “Why?”\nWhy do we need a new approach to advertising and marketing?\n\nThe overcommunicated society\nThe answer is that we have become an overcommunicated society. The per-\ncapita consumption of advertising in America today is $376.62 a year. (That\ncompares with $16.87 in the rest of the world.)\nIf you spend $1 million a year on advertising, you are bombarding the\naverage consumer with less than a half cent of advertising, spread out over\n365 days—a consumer already exposed to $376.61½ worth of other\nadvertising.\n\nIn our overcommunicated society, to talk about the “impact” of your advertising is to seriously overstate the potential effectiveness of your message. Advertising is not a sledgehammer. It’s more like a light fog, a very light fog that envelops your prospects.\n\nIn the communication jungle out there, the only hope to score big is to be selective, to concentrate on narrow targets, to practice segmentation. In a word, “positioning.”\n\nThe mind, as a defense against the volume of today’s communications, screens and rejects much of the information offered it. In general, the mind accepts only that which matches prior knowledge or experience.",

Mind-changing is the road to advertising disaster.\n\n## The oversimplified mind\n\nThe only defense a person has in our overcommunicated society is an oversimplified mind.\n\nNot unless they repeal the law of nature that gives us only 24 hours in a day will they find a way to stuff more into the mind.\n\nThe average mind is already a dripping sponge that can only soak up more information at the expense of what’s already there.

(Ford could have the better ideas and still be in second place.) This is just a question that springs up in the prospect’s mind.  \nAnd your advertising, to be successful, must answer this question.\n\n**Diversification is not the answer**  \nNext to “people,” the most common corporate positioning theme is “diversification.” Companies want to become known as diversified manufacturers of a wide range of high-quality products.  \nBut diversification is not effective as a corporate advertising approach. As a matter of fact, the two concepts of positioning and diversification are poles apart.  \nIt’s a fact of life that strong positions in the prospect’s mind are built on major achievements. Not on broad product lines.  \nGeneral Electric is known as the world’s largest electrical manufacturer. Not as a diversified maker of industrial, transportation, chemical, and appliance products.  \nEven though General Electric makes thousands of consumer and industrial products, most of its successful products have been electrical ones. Most of its unsuccessful ones have been nonelectrical products. Computers being a typical example.  \nGeneral Motors is known as the world’s largest builder of automobiles. Not as a diversified maker of industrial, transportation, and appliance products.",

      "content": "IBM has a reputation as the world’s largest computer manufacturer. Not as a worldwide manufacturer of many types of office machines.  \nA company may be able to make more money by diversifying. It should think twice, however, about trying to build a position based on that concept.  \nEven the stock market consistently undervalues conglomerates like ITT and Gulf & Western. (Many companies are worth more broken into parts than they are worth whole.)  \nSometimes companies think they are concentrating their communication efforts when they are really not. The positioning concept becomes so broad that it is almost meaningless.  \nWhich company used to call itself “a developer and supplier of information systems for work, education, and entertainment?”  \nWould you believe Bell & Howell? That’s right, Bell & Howell.  \nHow do you develop an effective position for a company? Let’s look at Xerox, a company that seems to already have a position.\n\n## What’s in Xerox’s mind?  \nWhy would Xerox want a position? Xerox has a position. Xerox is the Coca-Cola of copiers.  \nQuick, name another copier company? Nothing jumps into the mind, does it? Sure, after a while, you probably can remember that Sharp, Savin, Ricoh, Royal, and Canon make copiers. Even IBM and Kodak make copiers.  \nBut nobody owns the copier position the way Xerox does. This is an enormous advantage in selling copiers. When you think your company needs another copier, your first thought is Xerox and your first telephone call is most likely to Xerox.  \nSo what’s the problem? Xerox sees the office market moving toward systems, especially computer-based information systems. So Xerox bought Scientific Data Systems and subsequently changed the name to Xerox Data Systems.  \n“Our objective in acquiring SDS,” said the chairman, “was to offer broader-based information systems. We feel that to really seize the opportunities around the world for supplying information, we had to broaden out from graphics, as IBM is broadening out into graphics. People in the seventies who can say to a customer, ‘We can handle all your information needs, whether fascimile transmission, graphics, or whatever,’ will have an enormous advantage.”",

      "content": "Six years later, Xerox Data Systems folded. But the loss of XDS didn’t stop Xerox from trying to broaden the company’s product line. Xerox was still committed to the concept of going beyond copiers.  \nIn the years to come, Xerox introduced a parade of office automation products. The XTEN network, the Ethernet network, the Star workstation, the 820 personal computer. “Now the industry will know our secret for certain,” declared a Xerox vice president. “We want to be No. 1 in this market.”\n\n## What’s in the prospect’s mind?  \nIf Xerox would look into the minds of its prospects, it would quickly see that moving into office information systems is not in the cards.  \nThe trade publication *Information Week* recently surveyed a sample of its subscribers. (The magazine has 100,000 subscribers, 80 percent of whom represent companies with 1000 or more employees. It would seem that this is the heart of the office automation market.)  \nHere are the answers given when subscribers were asked, “Which manufacturers of office information systems are you most interested in?”\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of manufacturer interest, likely within a specific market or technology sector. The structure is a simple two-column table, listing five distinct manufacturers: IBM, Wang, Digital Equipment, AT&T, and Hewlett-Packard. Each manufacturer is associated with a percentage representing their level of interest. IBM demonstrates the highest interest at 81%, significantly exceeding the other listed companies. Wang follows with 40% interest, and Digital Equipment shows 36% interest. AT&T and Hewlett-Packard exhibit lower, comparable levels of interest at 22% and 21%, respectively. The data highlights a clear hierarchy of interest, with IBM leading and a gradual decrease in interest among the remaining manufacturers.\n\nXerox didn’t make the charts.  \nWhat can Xerox do? Our message to Xerox is to stop fighting copiers. You can’t change what’s in the prospect’s mind.  \nStart using copiers. They could be your strongest asset. An asset in a strategic war with IBM and AT&T.\n\n## The “third-leg” strategy It’s a way for Xerox to take advantage of its heritage.\n\nAs with many strategies, it’s helpful to step back and get a sense of what has been going on in the marketplace.\n\nLet’s look first at the office of the past. Things were simple then. To put yourself in business, you got a telephone from AT&T, a typewriter from IBM, and a copier from Xerox.",

The telephone and copier legs have hardly changed at all.\n\nWhat about the office of the future? If you believe everything you read, the office of the future will have a single leg consisting of an office automation system supplied by a single vendor. IBM, of course, is everyone’s bet.\n\nAs a result, every manufacturer worth its computer is chasing this “single vendor” idea.\n\nBut systems don’t always sell. The high-fidelity audio system was never supplied by one vendor as consumers picked the receivers and turntables and tape players they wanted.\n\nThe same went for the home entertainment center and the dream that GE had to sell all the major appliances in the kitchen. The woman of the house picked her favorite brands.\n\nFurthermore, even if the office of the future should turn out to be one big system supplied by one big manufacturer, it’s unlikely that Xerox would be a major factor.\n\nTherefore, Xerox has nothing to lose and everything to gain by betting on a different scenario.\n\nThe “third-leg” scenario is a different view of the office of the future. It’s a view that sees the office of the future as still having three legs. The telephone leg of AT&T becomes a communication leg with the addition of voice mail and facsimile equipment.\n\nThe typewriter leg of IBM becomes an input or processing leg with the addition of computers, workstations, and networks. The question is what will Xerox add to the copier leg?\n\n## Some “cross-log” difficulties There’s a good deal of evidence that the merging of legs is not the way of the future.\n\nHistory points to the difficulty of many “cross-leg” activities.\n\nTake Xerox vs. IBM. (1) Xerox has not been very successful with computers, workstations, or local area networks, all of which belong to the leg owned by IBM. (2) On the other hand, IBM has not been very successful with copiers, a leg, or position, owned by Xerox.\n\nTake Xerox vs. AT&T. (1) Nobody, including Xerox, has done very well with facsimile equipment, a leg owned by AT&T. (2) Voice mail and facsimile will take off as soon as AT&T gets behind them.",

Instead of being an obstacle, the copier/computer gap in the long run could turn out to be Xerox’s strongest ally.\n\n**“Third-leg” opportunities**  \nIf AT&T’s telephone leg has become the communication leg and IBM’s typewriter leg has become the input and processing leg, then what has Xerox’s copier leg become?\n\nThe obvious answer is the output leg. There are many “third-leg” opportunities for Xerox as offices add computer printers, scanners, and storage devices to complement their copiers.\n\nFurthermore, a hot new technology is moving into the output side of the office. That technology is the laser. There are laser printers, laser typesetters, laser memory systems.\n\nFurthermore, the laser is making a name for itself in many other places. In communication, the laser is beginning to replace satellites. In the hospital, the laser is revolutionizing heart surgery. In the supermarket, you find laser check-out counters.\n\nMcDonnell/Douglas talks about a laser that is “capable of transmitting the entire contents of a 24-volume set of encyclopedia in a single second.” United Telecom is setting up a nationwide laser network. AT&T is laying down a transatlantic laser link. GTE is bouncing laser beams off the moon.\n\nIn the consumer field, there is the laser videodisk player. The laser audiodisk player. And the laser everything disk which can play both video and audio.  \nNo self-respecting rock show would end without a laser light show. Even Ronald Reagan’s “star wars” satellites would be equipped with nuclear-powered laser weapons.",

In other words, it connects with Xerox’s last big technology.  \nLasography from Xerox, the company that’s perceived to be in the “ography” business.\n\nLasography uses lasers, which are perceived to be on the leading edge of technology.  \nLasography is the one concept that takes advantage of Xerox’s position and broadens it to include the next generation of products.  \nIn the positioning game you can’t sit still.

If the city had a gym team, presumably they would be called the New York Sweats.  \nWhy stop there? A street gang could be the New York Ghetts. City planners, the New York Debts.  \nFortunately for one’s sanity, the trend seems to be in the other direction.

With one word, “Wets,” we know it’s (1) a professional sports team, (2) located in the metropolitan New York area, and (3) involved in some kind of water sport.  \nBut that’s only in the short term. As the original announcement fades in the mind, confusion sets in.  \nIs there really a swimming team called the Wets? Or have I confused them with a basketball team called the Nets? Or was I thinking about a tennis team called the Sets? Now let’s see, the Nets changed their name to the Apples. Or was it the Sets that changed their name to the Apples?  \nBecause the line-extension name is related to the original name, it achieves an instant flash of understanding. “Ah, yes, Diet Coca-Cola.” It also generates an instant flash of sales.\n\nWhen Alka-Seltzer announces a new product like Alka-Seltzer Plus, everybody stocks up on it. Consumers aren’t necessarily buying it, but retailers are.\n\nSo the early sales figures look good. (To book $1 million worth of business, you only have to sell $35 worth to every supermarket.)\n\nBusiness looks great the first 6 months as you fill the pipelines. But when the reorders don’t come in, all of a sudden things turn dark.\n\n## Long-term disadvantages\n\nAfter the initial recognition of a line-extension brand, the prospect is never quite sure there is such a product.",

Kraft cheese, mayonnaise, or salad dressing?  \nThe confusion caused when one name stands for more than one product is slowly but surely sapping the strength of brands like Scott and Kraft.  \nLike a star that’s overexpanded, the brand eventually becomes a burned-out hulk.

But there was a 12-year-old brand of scotch in the U.S. market well before Chivas.  \nJohnnie Walker Black Label.  \nToday, of course, Chivas Regal outsells Johnnie Walker Black Label by a considerable margin.  \n“Give me a Johnnie Walker with a splash, bartender.”  \n“Black Label or Red Label, sir?”  \n“Aaaaaaaaaaah … the hell with it. Make it a Chivas.”  \nCutty 12 and Johnnie Walker Black Label are step-up examples of line extension. They usually result in anemic sales at the higher-priced end. (Who wants to pay premium prices for a low-price name?)\n\n## What’s a Packard?  \nThe step-down problem is just the reverse. Step-down products are often instantly successful. The hangover comes later.  \nBefore World War II Packard was the premier American automobile. More so even than Cadillac, it was a status symbol esteemed all over the world.  \nHeads of state bought armored Packards. One was made for Franklin Roosevelt. Like Rolls-Royce, Packard loftily declined the annual model-change policy of lesser makers. They positioned themselves above the pack.  \nThen in the middle thirties, Packard introduced their first step-down model, the relatively inexpensive Packard Clipper.\n\nThe Packard Clipper was the most successful car Packard ever built.  \nSales were terrific, but it killed the company. (Or more precisely, it killed Packard’s prestige position, which in turn killed the company.)  \nPackard drifted along until 1954 when Studebaker absorbed the company. The end of the road came years later.",

What options are available?  \nTo the average automobile prospect, General Motors has succeeded in communicating almost nothing about Cadillac. Except its position as the top-of-the-line, domestic luxury automobile.  \nBut even General Motors sometimes forgets that for every product there are two points of view. And most line-extension mistakes are made because the marketer did not appreciate this fact.  \nWhat’s a Cadillac? This might surprise you, but from General Motors’ point of view, a Cadillac is not an automobile at all. It’s a division. As a matter of fact, it’s one of GM’s most profitable divisions.  \nBut from the buyer’s point of view, Cadillac is a big luxury car. You can see the problem.  \nBecause of the gasoline situation, Cadillac is worried. So to maintain that profitability, General Motors has introduced a small Cadillac, the Cimarron. But in the long-term a mini-Cadillac conflicts with the big-car position that Cadillac owns in the mind.  \nSo the prospect looks at the Cimarron and asks, “Is it or isn’t it a Cadillac?”  \nLong-term, the Cimarron gets in the way of the most effective answer to the challenge of smaller luxury cars like Mercedes and BMW. To establish a small luxury brand, General Motors needs a separate high-price name and a separate dealer organization.\n\n## What’s a Chevrolet?  \nFor automobiles as well as other products, you can ask yourself that age-old question and you’ll know if you have a positioning problem.  \nWhat is it?\n\nFor example, what’s a Chevrolet? It’s a car that’s fallen into the everybody trap. By trying to appeal to everybody, a product winds up appealing to nobody.  \nWhat’s a Chevrolet? We’ll tell you what a Chevrolet is. It’s a big, small, cheap, expensive car.  \nO.K., how come Chevy is still No. 1? How come they haven’t lost their leadership to Ford?  \nTo which we reply, “What’s a Ford?” Same problem. Ford is also a big, small, cheap, expensive car.  \nFord has another problem. Not only is Ford an automobile brand. Ford is also a company.  \nA Ford Ford might be all right, but there is a real problem for the company in selling Ford Mercurys or Ford Lincolns. (One reason why the Ford Motor Company has always had a hard time selling higher-priced cars.)",

Usually the result of finding a wide-open creneau and then exploiting it brilliantly.  \nVolkswagon invented the small-car position and moved rapidly to exploit the breakthrough. “Think small,” perhaps the most famous single advertisement ever run, stated the position in no uncertain terms.  \nVery quickly, the Volkswagen Beetle established an exceptionally strong position in the automotive market. Like most classic success stories, Volkswagen became more than a brand name for a product.  \n“I drive a Volkswagen” says more than who made the automobile the person owns. “I drive a Volkswagen” says something about the owner’s way of life. A no-nonsense, practical person, self-confident about his or her status in life. A simple, functional piece of transportation equipment.  \nThe Volkswagen owner is a reverse snob. He or she loves to put down the car buyer who loves to impress the neighbors. “The 1970 Volkswagen will stay ugly longer” expresses this attitude perfectly.  \nAct Two is fueled by greed and visions of unending successes. So Volkswagen extends Volkswagen reliability and quality to bigger, more expensive cars.\n\nTo buses and jeep-type vehicles.  \nAct Three is the denouement. Is it possible that eight models won’t sell as well as one? It’s not only possible, it happened.  \nFrom first place in imported cars, Volkswagen fell to fourth. Behind Toyota, Datson, and Honda. And just barely ahead of Mazda and Subaru.  \nThe pattern of early success followed by line extension followed by disillusionment is fairly common. After all, you can’t expect companies like Scott and Volkswagen to rest on their laurels. You’d expect them to find new fields to conquer. So how do they go about finding them? One way is obvious. They develop a new concept or a new product with a new position and a new name to match.",

(Just the opposite of what you might expect.)  \nHow far should you stretch a name? This is an economics call as much as a judgment call.  \nLet’s say you have a line of canned vegetables. Do you have a brand name for peas, another for corn, and still a third for string beans? Probably not. Economically, it wouldn’t make sense.  \nSo Del Monte is probably right to use the same brand name on its line of canned fruits and vegetables. But notice what happens when a competitor zeroes in on a single product. The Dole line of canned pineapple.  \nDole vs. Del Monte in pineapple is no contest. Dole wins every time.  \nSo what does Dole do next? It puts the Dole name on fresh bananas. The Dole banana.  \nLet’s say Dole is successful in making Dole mean bananas. So what happens to pineapple? It’s the teeter-totter principle with bananas on one side and pineapple on the other.  \nBut can’t Dole do what Del Monte did? Become a full-line supplier of canned and fresh food products?  \nSure, but only at the expense of sacrificing its valuable pineapple franchise. And with the added disadvantage of being the last to line-extend.\n\n**Rules of the road** We call line extension a “trap,” not a mistake.\n\nLine extension can work if….\nBut it’s a big if.

If you don’t do any advertising.  \nThe truth is, many products are sold, few are positioned.  \nThat is, the customer will pick up a can of peas without having a going-in preference, or position, for a brand of peas. In this case, any well-known brand name is going to do better than any unknown name.  \nAnd if you work for a company with thousands of small-volume products (3M is a typical example), you obviously cannot have a new name for every one.  \nSo we offer some rules of the road that will tell you when to use the house name and when not to.",

No wonder most people use R-C-A, three syllables long.  \nGen-er-al E-lec-tric is six syllables long, so most people use G-E, two syllables.  \nGen-er-al Mo-tors is often GM. A-mer-i-can Mo-tors is often AM. But Ford Mo-tor is almost never referred to as FM. The single syllable Ford says it all.  \nBut where there’s no phonetic advantage, most people won’t use initials. New York and N.Y. are both two syllables long. So while the initials N.Y. are often written, they are seldom spoken.  \nLos An-ge-les is four syllables long, so L.A. is frequently used. Note, too, that San Fran-cis-co, a four-syllable word, is seldom shortened to “S.F.” Why? There’s a perfectly good two syllable word (Frisco) to use a shorthand for San Francisco. Which is why people say “Jer-sey” for New Jersey instead of “N.J.”  \nWhen they have a choice of a word or a set of initials, both equal in phonetic length, people will invariably use the word, not the initials.  \nPhonetic length can sometimes fool you. The initials WU look a lot shorter than the name Western Union. But phonetically they are exactly the same length.\n\nDou-ble-U U. West-ern Un-ion. (Except for W, every other English language letter is just one syllable.)\n\nWhile customers refer to companies phonetically, the companies they talk about have a different way of looking at themselves. Companies are visually oriented. They go to a lot of trouble making sure the names look right without considering how it sounds.\n\n## Visual shorthand\n\nBusiness people also fall into the same trap.

Brown from GMC on internal letters and memos.",

We store sounds directly and then play them back in various combinations as our mental dexterity improves.  \nAs you grow up, you learn to translate written words into the aural language needed by the brain so rapidly that you are unaware the translation process is taking place.  \nThen you read in the paper that 80 percent of learning takes place through the eyes. Of course it does. But reading is only a portion of the learning process. Much learning occurs from visual clues which do not involve reading in the conventional sense at all. As when you learn the emotional state of another person by “reading” body clues.  \nWhen words are read, they are not understood until the visual/verbal translator in your brain takes over to make aural sense out of what you have seen.  \nIn the same way, a musician learns to read music and hear the sound in his or her head, just as if someone were actually playing the tune on an instrument.  \nTry to memorize a poem without reading it out loud. It’s far easier to memorize written material if we reinforce the aural component, the working language of the brain.  \nWhich is why not only names but also headlines, slogans, and themes should be examined for their aural qualities. Even if you plan to use them in printed material only.  \nDid you think that Hubert and Elmer were bad names? If so, you must have translated the printed words into their aural equivalents. Because Hubert and Elmer don’t look bad. They just sound bad.  \nIn a way, it’s a shame that the print media (newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising) came first and radio second. Radio is really the primal media. And print is the higher-level abstraction.  \nMessages would “sound better” in print if they were designed for radio first. Yet we usually do the reverse. We work first in print and then in the broadcast media.\n\n**Name obsolescence** Another reason companies drop their names for initials is the obsolescence of the name itself.\n\nRCA sells a lot of things besides radios.",

Eaton Yale & Towne was the result of a merger that produced a big company with a complicated name. Socony-Mobil was saddled with a first name that originally stood for Standard Oil Company of New York.\n\nAll of these names have been changed for sound marketing reasons. The traditional “foot-in-the-past” approach could have produced USR Corporation, EY&T Company, and SM Inc. Three marketing monstrosities.\n\nInstead, “forgetting the past” created three new modern corporate identities—Uniroyal, Eaton, and Mobil. The marketing strengths of these names speak for themselves. These companies successfully forgot the past and positioned themselves against the future.\n\n**The confusion between cause and effect**  \nIn spite of the drawbacks, companies are lured to initials like moths to a candle. The success of the IBMs of this world seems to be proof that initials are effective. It’s the classic confusion between cause and effect.\n\nInternational Business Machines became so rich and famous (the cause) that everyone knew what company you were talking about when you used its initials (the effect).\n\nWhen you try to reverse the procedure, it doesn’t work. You can’t use the initials of a company that is only modestly successful (the cause) and then expect it to become rich and famous (the effect).\n\nIt’s like trying to become rich and famous by buying limousines and corporate jets. First, you have to become successful in order to have the money to buy the fringe benefits.\n\nIn some ways, the rush to adopt initials represents a desire to look accepted even at the cost of a loss in communications. It also represents the copycat thinking prevalent in some management circles. The success of IBM encouraged word processing competitors like CPT and NBI to use initials in their names.\n\nThe success of AT&T encouraged MCI to also market their long distance service with an initial name.\n\nAnd look at the contrasting name strategies of two different airlines.",

Much better than the initials PAA, which would be difficult to remember.  \nTrans World Air-lines (four syllables) is actually phonetically shorter than the T-Dou-ble-U-A they are using, But isn’t TWA well known? Yes, it is, thanks to $70 million worth of advertising a year.  \nAlthough TWA spends about as much on advertising as its larger American and United competitors, surveys show that TWA has half the passenger preference of the other two. The inefficiency of the initials TWA is one reason.  \nWhat name should Trans World Airlines use?  \n“Trans World,” of course. Only two syllables long, Trans World is short and graphic.\n\n## Acronyms and phone directories  \nSome companies are lucky. Their initials, either by design or by accident, form acronyms. For example: Fiat (Federation Internationale Automobiles Torino) and Sabena (*Société Anonyme Belge d’Exploitation de la Navigation Aèrienne*).  \nOften organizations will select carefully names that form meaningful acronyms. Two examples: CARE (Committee for Aid and Rehabilitation in Europe) and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers).  \nOther companies aren’t so lucky. When General Aniline & Film changed its name to GAF, it chose to overlook the fact that the acronym sounds like “clumsy error.” GAF is a gaffe in more ways than one.  \nThe other thing people tend to forget when they pick a name is the problem of finding it in the telephone directory. Since you seldom look up your own name in a phone book, you might not realize how hard it is to locate.  \nTake MCI, for example. In the Manhattan telephone directory, you might expect to find MCI somewhere between McHugh and McKensie. But of course, it’s not there. MCI Telecommunications is 48 pages away where it has to compete with seven other companies that incorporate MCI in their names. (Following standard rules of alphabetizing a list of names, the phone company puts all initial names up front.) Take USM Corporation, for example.\n\nIn the Manhattan telephone directory, there are seven pages of listings starting with “US.” So you ought to be able to find USM somewhere between US Luggage & Leather Products and *US News & World Report*.",

Leaders can often cover a competitive move and retain their leadership.\n\nBut followers are not in the same position to benefit from a covering strategy. When a follower copies a leader, it’s not covering at all. It’s better described as a me-too response. (Usually phrased more diplomatically as “keeping in tune with the times.”)\n\n## Why products fail\n\nMost products fail to achieve reasonable sales goals because the accent is on “better” rather than “speed.” That is, the No. 2 company thinks the road to success is to introduce a me-too product, only better.\n\nIt’s not enough to be better than the competitor. You must introduce your product before someone else has a chance to establish leadership. With a more massive advertising and promotion launch. And a better name. (More on this point later.)\n\nYet the opposite normally occurs. The me-too company wastes valuable time on improving the product. Then the launch is made with a smaller advertising budget than the leader’s. And then the new product is given the house name, because that’s the easy way to ensure a quick share of market. All deadly traps in our overcommunicated society.\n\nHow do you find an open position in the prospect’s mind?\n\n## Cherchez le creneau\n\nThe French have a marketing expression that sums up this strategy rather neatly.\n\n* Cherchez le creneau. “Look for the hole.”\n* Cherchez le creneau and then fill it.\n\nThat advice goes against the “bigger and better” philosophy ingrained into the American spirit.\n\nAnother typically American attitude makes positioning thinking difficult. Ever since childhood, we have been taught to think in a certain way.\n\n“The power of positive thinking,” Norman Vincent Peale called it. An attitude which may sell a lot of books but which can destroy a person’s ability to find a creneau.\n\nTo find a creneau, you must have the ability to think in reverse, to go against the grain. If everyone else is going east, see if you can find your creneau by going west. A strategy that worked for Christopher Columbus can also work for you.\n\nLet’s explore some strategies for finding creneaus.\n\n### The size creneau\n\nFor years, Detroit automakers were on a longer, lower kick. Each model year, cars became more streamlined, better looking.\n\nEnter the Volkswagen Beetle. Short, fat, and ugly.",

Then we’ll play up the reliability angle,” is your ordinary strategy.\n\nBut the creneau was size. The most effective ad Volkswagen ever ran was the one which stated the position clearly and unequivocally.\n\n“Think small.”\n\nWith two simple words, this headline did two things at once. It stated the Volkswagen position, and it challenged the prospect’s assumption that bigger is necessarily better.\n\nThe effectiveness of this approach, of course, depends on the existence of an open creneau in the prospect’s mind. Not that there weren’t other small cars on the market at the time the Beetle was introduced. There were, but no one else had preempted the small-car position.\n\nIntegrated circuits and other electronic devices make the “small-size” creneau technically feasible in many product categories. Only time will tell which companies will be able to capitalize on electronics to build valuable positions based on miniaturization.\n\nThe opposite presents opportunities too. There are opportunities to build positions in projection television sets and other products based on large The classic example is Michelob.\n\n## The high-price creneau\n\nThe people at Anheuser-Busch found an untapped market for a premium-priced domestic beer. And they moved into the mind with the Michelob name.\n\nHigh-price creneaus seem to be opening up in many product categories. As our throwaway society sees the urgent need for conversation, there’s a new appreciation of a quality product designed to last.\n\nWhich is one reason behind the success of $40,000 automobiles like the BMW 635-CS and $50,000 cars like the Mercedes-Benz 500-SEL.\n\nAnd S. T. Dupont (nice name) lighters at, as the ads say, “$1500 and down.”\n\nPrice is an advantage, especially if you’re the first in the category to establish the high-price creneau.\n\nSome brands base almost their entire product message on the high-price concept.\n\n* “There is only one Joy, the costliest perfume in the world.”\n* “Why you should invest in a Piaget, the world’s most expensive watch.”\n\nHigh price is effective not only for luxury items like cars, perfume, and watches, but also mundane products like Whitney’s Yogurt and Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Popping Corn.",

Even traditional low-priced products like flour, sugar, and salt represent positioning opportunities.\n\nToo often, however, greed gets confused with positioning thinking. Charging high prices is not the way to get rich. Being the first to (1) establish the high-price position (2) with a valid product story (3) in a category where consumers are receptive to a high-priced brand is the secret of success. Otherwise, your high price just drives prospective customers away.\n\nFurthermore, the place to establish the high price is in the ads, not in the store. The price (high or low) is as much a feature of the product as anything else.\n\nIf you do your positioning job right, there should be no price surprises in the store. Your ads don’t have to quote exact prices, although sometimes that’s a good thing to do.\n\nWhat they should do, however, is to clearly position your brand in a particular price category.\n\n## The low-price creneau\nInstead of high price, the opposite direction can also be a profitable tack to take.\n\nIn evaluating price as a possible creneau, keep in mind that the low-price creneau is often a good choice for new products like facsimile equipment and videotape players. Products customers believe they are taking a chance on. (If the thing doesn’t work right, I’m not out that much money.)\n\nThe high-price creneau is often a good choice for old, established products like automobiles, watches, and television sets. Especially those products for which customers are not happy with existing repair services.\n\nThe recent introduction of generic (“no name”) food brands is an attempt to exploit the low-price creneau in the supermarket. (Although retailer emphasis on sales and low prices over the years have pretty much wiped out the opportunities in that direction.)\n\nWhen you combine all three price strategies (high, standard, and low), you normally have a strong marketing approach. As Anheuser-Busch has done with Michelob, Budweiser, and Busch (their low-priced beer).\n\nThe weakest brand, of course, is Busch because of the poor name and lack of a strong positioning concept. Why would the owner of the place put his name only on his lowest-priced product?\n\nA better name for a low-priced beer is Old Milwaukee, which leads its category in sales.",

Luke really was movin’ slow, so Lorillard killed him.  \nIn positioning a product, there’s no substitute for getting there first.  \nWhat masculinity did for Marlboro, femininity did for Virginia Slims, a brand that carved out a substantial share with the opposite approach. But Eve, a me-too brand that also tried the feminine approach, was a failure. Eve was too late.  \nWhen you use sex to segment a product category and establish a position, the obvious approach isn’t always the best.  \nTake perfume, for example. You’d think that the more delicate and feminine the brand, the more successful it would be. So what’s the largest-selling brand of perfume in the world?  \nNo, it’s not Arpege or Chanel No. 5. It’s Revlon’s Charlie. The first brand to try a masculine name complete with pantsuit ads.  \nThe knockoff brand, “Just Call Me Maxi,” was not only poorly done but reportedly cost the president of Max Factor his job.  \nThe Charlie success story illustrates the paradox of established product categories like perfume. The bulk of the business is in one direction (feminine brand names), but the opportunity lies in the opposite (a masculine brand name).  \nAge is another positioning strategy to use. Geritol tonic is a good example of a successful product aimed at older folks.  \nAim toothpaste is a good example of a product aimed at children. Aim has carved out 10 percent of the toothpaste market. A tremendous accomplishment in a market dominated by two powerful brands, Crest and Colgate.  \nTime of day is also a potential positioning possibility. Nyquil, the first night-time cold remedy, is one example.  \nDistribution is another possibility. L’eggs was the first hosiery brand to be distributed in supermarkets and mass merchandise outlets. L’eggs now is the leading brand, with sales in the hundreds of millions.  \nAnother possibility is the heavy-user position. “The one beer to have when you’re having more than one” positioned Schaefer as the brand for the heavy beer drinker.\n\n**The factory creneau** One common mistake in looking for creneaus is filling a hole in the factory rather than one in the mind.\n\nFord’s Edsel is the classic example.

If the world were flat, they would see the whole ship at once.\n\nAll the mathematical arguments in the world weren’t as effective as a simple observation the public could verify themselves.\n\nOnce an old idea is overturned, selling the new idea is often ludicrously simple. As a matter of fact, people will often actively search for a new idea to fill the void.\n\nNever be afraid to conflict either. The crux of a repositioning program is undercutting an existing concept, product, or person.\n\nConflict, even personal conflict, can build a reputation overnight. Where would Sam Ervin have been without Richard Nixon?\n\nFor that matter, where would Richard Nixon have been without Alger Hiss?\n\nAnd Ralph Nader got famous not by saying anything about Ralph Nader but by going out and attacking the world’s largest corporation single-handedly.\n\nPeople like to watch the bubble burst.",

Couldn’t PepsiCo, the importers of the Stolichnaya brand, have simply advertised it as the “Russian vodka?”  \nThey could have, of course.

Furthermore, the names themselves (Samovar, Smirnoff, Wolfschmidt, Popov, Nikolai) imply a Russian origin. It’s this latter factor alone that was responsible for much of Stolichnaya’s astounding success.  \nPeople like to see the high and mighty exposed.

Introduced with a $15 million fanfare from Procter & Gamble, the “new-fangled” potato chips rapidly gobbled up 18 percent of the market.  \nThen the old-fangled brands like Borden’s Wise struck back with a classic repositioning strategy.  \nThey read the two labels on television. “In Wise, you find: Potatoes. Vegetable oil. Salt. In Pringle’s, you find: Dehydrated potatoes. Mono- and diglycerides. Ascorbic acid. Butylated hydroxy-anisole.”  \nSales of Pringle’s came tumbling down. From a respectable 18 percent of the potato chip market to 10 percent. A far cry from P & G’s goal of 25 percent.  \nOddly enough, research isolated another problem. The most common complaint against Pringle’s is that they “taste like cardboard.”  \nIt’s exactly what you might expect from a consumer exposed to words like “diglycerides” and “butylated hydroxy-anisole.” Taste, esthetic or gustatory, is in the mind. Your eyes see what you expect to see. Your tongue reacts the way you expect it to react.  \nIf you were forced to drink a beaker of dihydrogen oxide, your response would probably be negative. If you asked for a glass of water, you might enjoy it.  \nThat’s right. There’s no difference on the palate. The difference is in the brain.  \nRecently the Cincinnati giant changed its strategy. Pringle’s would become an “all natural” product.  \nBut the damage had already been done. In politics or packaged goods, the rule is once a loser, always a loser. It would be as hard to bring Pringle’s back as to bring Jimmy Carter back.  \nIn some small corner of the brain is a penalty box marked “loser.” Once your product is sent there, the game is over.\n\nGo back to square one and start all over again. With a new product and a new game.  \nOf all companies, Procter & Gamble should have known the power of repositioning. And should have taken steps in advance to protect Pringle’s.",

P & G used two words to reposition Listerine, the King of Halitosis Hill.  \n“Medicine breath.”  \nThese two words were enough to torpedo Listerine’s highly successful “the taste you hate, twice a day” theme.  \nThe Scope attack carved a few share points out of market leader Listerine and firmly established Scope in second place.  \nThe Listerine/Scope battle caused the usual casualties. Micrin and Binaca folded. Lavoris saw its market share wither away.  \nBut let’s face it. Scope has not become the market success it should be, based on theory.  \nWhy? Look at the name again.  \nScope? It sounds like a board game from Parker Brothers. Not like a good-tasting mouthwash that will make you a big hit with the opposite sex. If Scope had been given a name like Close-Up toothpaste, it could have parlayed its brilliant repositioning strategy with sales success to match.\n\n## Repositioning vs. comparative ads  \nThe success of the Tylenol, Scope, Royal Doulton, and other repositioning programs has spawned a host of similar advertising. Too often, however, these copycat campaigns have missed the essence of repositioning strategy.  \n“We’re better than our competitors” isn’t repositioning. It’s comparative advertising and not very effective. There’s a psychological flaw in the advertiser’s reasoning which the prospect is quick to detect. “If your brand is so good, how come it’s not the leader?”  \nA look at comparative ads suggests why most of them aren’t effective. They fail to reposition the competition.  \nRather, they use the competitor as a benchmark for their own brand. Then they tell the reader or viewer how much better they are. Which, of course, is exactly what the prospect expects the advertiser to say.\n\n“Ban is more effective than Right Guard, Secret, Sure, Arrid Extra Dry, Mitchum, Soft & Dry, Body All, and Dial,” said a recent Ban ad.

(And many husbands and wives would be in deep trouble too.)  \nActually, the Federal Trade Commission deserves much of the credit for making repositioning ads possible—at least on television.  \nIn 1964 the National Broadcasting Company dropped its ban on comparative advertising. But nothing much happened. Commercials are expensive to produce, a few advertisers wanted to produce two versions. One to run on NBC and one to run on the other two networks.  \nSo in 1972 the FTC prodded the American Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System to allow commercials that named rival brands.  \nIn 1974 the American Association of Advertising Agencies issued new comparative ad guidelines which represented a complete turnaround from previous policy. Traditionally, the 4A’s had discouraged the use of comparative ads by its member agencies.  \nIn 1975 the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which controls radio and television in Britain, gave the green light for “knocking” ads in the U.K.  \nSo repositioning has been “legal” for at least a decade.\n\n## Is repositioning ethical?  \nIn the past advertising was prepared in isolation. That is, you studied the product and its features, and then you prepared advertising which communicated to your customers and prospects the benefits of those features. It didn’t make much difference whether the competition offered those features or not.  \nIn the traditional approach, you ignored competition and made every claim seem like a preemptive claim. Mentioning a competitive product, for example, was considered not only bad taste but poor strategy as well.\n\nIn the positioning era, however, the rules are reversed. To establish a position, you must often not only name competitive names but also ignore most of the old advertising rules as well.\n\nIn category after category, the prospect already knows the benefits of using the product. To climb on his or her product ladder, you must relate your brand to the brands already in the prospect’s mind.\n\nYet repositioning programs, even though effective, have stirred up a host of complaints. Many advertising people deplore the use of such tactics.",

If you want culture and refinement, you produce operas. If you want to make money, you produce movies.\n\nCulture and refinement may be admirable qualities, but not in advertising.\n\nIs society sick when people are ready to believe the worst about a product or person, but balk about believing the best?\n\nAre newspapers wrong to put the bad news on the front page and the good news in the back along with the society columns?

But conglomerates have provided the capital to sustain vigorous competition in the marketplace. If it weren’t for the conglomerates, we would be a nation of semimonopolies.  \nTake copiers, for example. Xerox, the pioneer in the plain-paper field, now faces competition from the computer manufacturer (IBM), from a photo company (Kodak), and from a postage-meter company (Pitney Bowes).  \nEven when conglomerates grow by acquisition (RCA’s purchase of Hertz, ITT’s purchase of Avis), they provide the money needed to sustain growth and competition.  \nOtherwise, when the original founders retired or died, the tax bite would leave the company too weak to defend its turf.  \nThe typical life cycle of a corporation starts with an entrepreneur with an idea. If successful, you can count on two things, death and taxes, to ensure that the operation will end up as part of a conglomerate.\n\n## Two different strategies  \nBecause companies grow by two different strategies (internal development or external acquisition), two different “name” strategies evolved. Corporate egos dictate the strategies.  \nWhen a company develops a product internally, it usually puts the corporate name on the product. For example, General Electric computers.  \nWhen the company develops a product by external acquisition, it usually keeps the existing name. RCA kept the Hertz name. ITT kept the Avis name.  \nBut not always.  \nWhen Sperry-Rand developed a computer line internally, they called the product Univac. When Xerox went into computers by external acquisition, they changed the name from Scientific Data Systems to Xerox Data Systems.  \nCorporate egos aside, when should a company use the house name and when should they select a new name? (You can’t really disregard corporate egos.\n\nTry telling General Electric not to put the GE name on a new product and you’ll begin to appreciate the enormity of the corporate ego problem.)  \nOne reason why the principles of name selection remain so elusive is the Charles Lindbergh syndrome.  \nIf you get into the mind first, any name is going to work.  \nIf you didn’t get there first, then you are flirting with disaster if you don’t select an appropriate name.",

To name a few: Colgate toothpaste, Colgate toothbrushes, Palmolive Rapid Shave, Palmolive dishwashing liquid, Palmolive soap.  \nYou won’t find any house names in the Procter & Gamble lineup. Procter & Gamble carefully positions each product so that it occupies a unique niche in the mind. For example: Tide makes clothes “white.” Cheer makes them “whiter than white.” And Bold makes them “bright.”  \nWith fewer brands Procter & Gamble does twice as much business and makes five times as much profit as Colgate-Palmolive.  \nWhile it’s fashionable on Madison Avenue these days to pooh-pooh Procter & Gamble advertising, it’s interesting to note that Procter & Gamble makes more money every year than all of America’s 6000 advertising agencies combined.\n\n**A new product needs a new name**  \nWhen a really new product comes along, it’s almost always a mistake to hang a well-known name on it.  \nThe reason is obvious. A well-known name got well known because it stood for something. It occupies a position in the prospect’s mind. A really well-known name sits on the top rung of a sharply defined ladder.  \nThe new product, if it’s going to be successful, is going to require a new ladder. New ladder, new name. It’s as simple as that.\n\nYet the pressures to go with the well-known name are enormous. “A well-known name has built-in acceptance. Our customers and prospects know us and our company, and they will be more likely to accept our new product if we have our name on it.” The logic of line extension is overwhelming and sometimes very difficult to refute.  \nYet history has destroyed this illusion.  \nXerox spent almost a billion dollars for a profitable computer company with a perfectly good name, Scientific Data Systems. Then what did Xerox do? Of course, they changed the name of the company from Scientific Data Systems to Xerox Data Systems.  \nWhy? Obviously because Xerox was the better and more widely known name.

But today you can.  \nThe rapid rise of a “nobody” like Gary Hart is proof that politics is a different game today. The old maxims are no longer valid.  \nRichard Nixon may be the best-known political name in the world. But almost any nobody could beat him.  \nPublicity is like eating. Nothing kills the appetite quite as much as a hearty meal. And nothing kills the publicity potential of a product or a person quite as much as a cover story in a national magazine.  \nThe media are constantly looking for the new and different, the fresh young face.  \nIn dealing with media, you must conserve your anonymity until you are ready to spend it. And then when you spend it, spend it big. Always keeping in mind that the objective is not publicity or communication for its own sake, but publicity to achieve a position in the prospect’s mind.  \nAn unknown company with an unknown product has much more to gain from publicity than a well-known company with an established product.  \n“In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes,” Andy Warhol once predicted.  \nWhen your 15 minutes arrive, make the most of every second.",

That is, taking the name of an established product and using it on a new one. (The free-ride trap carried to its ultimate conclusion.)  \nDial soap, Dial deodorant.  \nLife Savers candy. Life Savers gum.  \nKleenex tissue. Kleenex towels.\n\nLine extension has swept through the advertising and marketing community like Sherman through Georgia. And for some very sound reasons.  \nLogic is on the side of line extension. Arguments of economics. Trade acceptance. Consumer acceptance. Lower advertising costs. Increased income. The corporate image.\n\n## Inside-out thinking\n\nLogic is on the side of line extension. Truth, unfortunately, is not.  \nLine extension is a result of clear, hard-headed, inside-out thinking that goes something like this:  \n> “We make Dial soap, a great product that gets the biggest share of the bar-soap market. When our customers see Dial deodorant, they’ll know it comes from the makers of the great Dial soap.”  \n> “Furthermore,” and this is the clincher, “Dial is a deodorant soap. Our customers will expect us to produce a high-quality underarm deodorant.” In short, Dial soap customers will buy Dial deodorants.\n\nNotice, however, how the rationale changes when the line extension is in the same category.  \nBayer “invented” aspirin and marketed the leading brand of analgesic for many years. The people at Bayer couldn’t fail to notice the progress made by the “anti-aspirin” approach used by Tylenol.\n\nSo Bayer introduced an acetaminophen product called “Bayer nonaspirin pain reliever.” Presumably people who had been buying Tylenol and other acetaminophen products would now switch back to Bayer, the leading name in headache remedies.  \nBut neither strategy worked.  \nDial has a large share of the soap market and a very small share of the deodorant market.  \nAnd Bayer nonaspirin never got more than a tiny share of the acetaminophen market.\n\n## Outside-in thinking",

Simply this: The brand name becomes a surrogate or substitute for the generic name.  \n“Where is the Bayer?”  \n“Hand me the Dial.”  \nThe stronger the position, the more often this substitution takes place. Some brands are so strong they are practically generic. Fiberglas, Formica, Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Sanka. “Generic” brand names are, of course, close to the edge, so they have to be handled carefully or Uncle Sam will take your goodies away.  \nFrom a communication point of view, the generic brand name is very efficient. One word serves in place of two. When you have a generic brand name, you can afford to ignore the brand and promote the category.  \n“Coffee keeps you awake? Drink Sanka.”  \n“Serve your family low-calorie Jell-O instead of cake or pie.”  \nFrom the prospect’s point of view, line extension works against the generic brand position. It blurs the sharp focus of the brand in the mind. No longer can the prospect say “Bayer” if he or she wants aspirin. Or “Dial” for soap.  \nIn a sense, line extension educates the prospect to the fact that Bayer is nothing but a brand name. It destroys the illusion that Bayer is a superior What actually gets driven into the mind is not the product at all but the “name” of the product, which the prospect uses as a hook to hang attributes on.\n\n## JCPenney vs. DieHard\n\nSo if the name of the automobile battery is the DieHard and Sears tells you that it will last 48 months, you have a hook (DieHard) to hang the long-lasting idea on.\n\nBut if the name of the battery is the JCPenney battery and the retailer tells you it never needs water, you have a very weak hook (JCPenney) to hang this feature on.\n\nIn a physical sense, the name is also like the point of a knife. It opens up the mind to let the message penetrate. With the right name, the product fills the creneau and stays there.\n\nSo why would JCPenney call it the JCPenney battery? Presumably there were other communicative words like DieHard available.",

C.” And another logical inside-out decision is made.\n\nBut when the tables are turned, the name makes no sense because the mind of the prospect is organized differently. The prospect thinks in terms of products.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that in terms of brand preference (the battery ladder in the mind of the prospect) the DieHard sits on the top rung and JCPenney is way down the line.\n\nBut doesn’t a big retailer like JCPenney sell a lot of batteries? Of course, but as everyone knows, many products with the wrong name are sold “in spite of” rather than “because of.” On the other hand, doesn’t the prospect have difficulty remembering that the DieHard battery can only be bought at Sears?\n\nYes, it is a problem for Sears and not everyone who might want to buy the DieHard will be able to make the connection. But it’s better to establish a position in the prospect’s mind first and then worry about how to establish a retail connection later.  \nIn positioning, the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily the best strategy.

In rapid succession, the company introduced Protein 21 hairspray in regular and extra hold, scented and unscented. Also Protein 21 conditioner (in two formulas) and Protein 21 concentrate.

Then Mr. Whipple and his tissue squeezers at Procter & Gamble moved in. Now ScotTissue is second to Charmin.  \nIn Scott’s case, a large share of market didn’t mean they owned the position. More important is a large share of mind. The consumer could write “Charmin, Kleenex, Bounty, and Pampers” on a shopping list and we’d know exactly what products he or she was going to get. “Scott” on a shopping list has no meaning.\n\nThe actual brand names aren’t much help either. Which brand, for example, is engineered for the nose, Scotties or ScotTissue?  \nIn positioning terms, the name Scott exists in limbo.

The first 100-mm cigarette was Pall Mall Gold, but Pall Mall fell into the line-extension trap.  \nThen Benson & Hedges moved in and preempted the long-cigarette position.  \nYou’d think the missed opportunity represented by Pall Mall Gold would have discouraged them.  \nBut it didn’t.

It boggles the mind.  \nNaturally, the two leading brands, Marlboro and Winston, have long since line-extended the lights, 100-mm, and menthol. So according to the theory, can you expect to see the Marlboro and Winston brands follow in Pall Mall’s steps?\n\nPerhaps.

The prospect didn’t recognize the difference.  \nBut the competition did.  \nChesebrough-Pond’s introduced Intensive Care. Now for the first time, the new creamlike lotion had a name which positioned the product clearly in the consumer’s mind. And the product took off.  \nOf course, when Jergens realized what was happening, they countered with a brand called Direct Aid.  \nBut it was the old story of too little and too late because the marketing victory went to Intensive Care. Today Intensive Care is the No. 1 brand. It outsells Jergens, Jergens Extra Dry, and Direct Aid combined.  \nBut isn’t the brand really called “Vaseline Intensive Care,” a line-extended name?\n\nTrue, but customers call the product Intensive Care, not Vaseline. In the mind of the prospect Vaseline is petroleum jelly; Intensive Care is a hand lotion.\n\n## Reverse line extension\nWhile line extension is usually a mistake, the reverse can work. Reverse line extension is called “broadening the base.” One of the best examples is Johnson’s baby shampoo.\n\nBy promoting the mildness of the product to the adult market, the company has made Johnson’s baby shampoo one of the leading brands of adult shampoo.\n\nNotice the characteristics of this broadening-the-base strategy. Same product, same package, same label. Only the application has changed.\n\nIf Johnson & Johnson had line-extended the product and introduced Johnson’s adult shampoo, the product would not have been nearly as successful.\n\nAnother example of broadening the base is Blue Nun, a white wine being promoted as equally good with meat courses as with fish.\n\nBut aren’t these examples of the “everybody trap”? Not exactly. Johnson’s baby shampoo is the first and only baby shampoo being promoted as an adult product too. And Blue Nun is the only white wine being advertised as good with meat as well as fish.\n\nIf other brands tried the same approach, they wouldn’t be nearly as successful as these two.",

A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet. Not only do you see what you want to see, you also smell what you want to smell. Which is why the single most important decision in the marketing of perfume is the name you decide to put on the brand.\n\nWould “Alfred” have sold as well as “Charlie?” Don’t bet on it.\n\nAnd Hog Island in the Caribbean was going nowhere until they changed the name to Paradise Island.\n\n## How to choose a name\n\nDon’t look to the past for guidance and pick the name of a French racing car driver (Chevrolet) or the daughter of your Paris representative (Mercedes).\n\nWhat worked in the past won’t necessarily work now or in the future. In the past when there were fewer products, when the volume of communication was lower, the name wasn’t nearly as important.\n\nToday, however, a lazy, say-nothing name isn’t good enough to cut into the mind. What you must look for is a name that begins the positioning process, a name that tells the prospect what the product’s major benefit is.\n\nLike Head & Shoulders shampoo, Intensive Care skin lotion, and Close-Up toothpaste.\n\nOr like DieHard for a longer-lasting battery. Shake ’n Bake for a new way to cook chicken. Edge for a shaving cream that lets you shave closer.\n\nA name should not go “over the edge,” though. That is, become so close to the product itself that it becomes generic, a general name for all products of its class rather than a trade name for a specific brand.\n\n“Lite beer from Miller” is a typical product name that went over the line. So now we have Schlitz Light, Coors Light, Bud Light, and a host of other light beers.\n\nThe public and the press quickly corrupted the name to “Miller Lite,” and so Miller lost its right to exclusive use of “light” or its phonetic equivalent as a trademark for beer.\n\nFor years to come, trademark attorneys will be using Lite as an example of the danger of using descriptive words as trademarks.

Or the street name for a narcotic cocaine?  \nSo strong is the secondary meaning of the word Coke that the Coca-Cola Company has nothing to fear from these negative connotations.  \nBut choosing a coined name like Keds, Kleenex, and Kotex for a new product is dangerous, to say the least. Only when you are first in the mind with an absolutely new product that millions of people are certain to want can you afford the luxury of a mean-nothing name.  \nThen, of course, any name would work.  \nSo stick with common descriptive words (Spray ’n Wash) and avoid the coined words (Qyx).  \nAs a guide, the five most common initial letters are S, C, P, A, and T.

It hides the origin of the product.  \nEveryone knows that butter is made from milk. But what’s margarine made from? Because the origin of the product is hidden, the prospect assumes there must be something basically wrong with margarine.\n\n**Bringing the product out of the closet** The first step in overcoming negative reactions is to bring the product out of the closet.\n\nTo deliberately polarize the situation by using a negative name like soy butter.",

Result: products called dextrose, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nWith names like “high-fructose corn syrup,” it’s no wonder that even in the trade the products were considered imitation or second-class in comparison with sucrose or “real sugar.” So Corn Products, one of the major suppliers of corn syrups, decided to call its sweeteners “corn sugars.” This move allowed the company to put corn on an equal footing with cane and beet.\n\n“Consider all three types of sugar,” say the ads. “Cane, beet, and corn.”\n\nMarketing people should know that the Federal Trade Commission is the keeper of the generics for many industries. But the FTC can be persuaded. “If we can’t call it sugar, can we put corn syrup in a soft drink and call the product ‘sugar-free’?”\n\nSpecial-interest groups recognize the power of a good name.

Among the four largest domestic airlines, Eastern consistently ranks fourth on passenger surveys.  \nWhy? Eastern has a regional name that puts it in a different category in the prospect’s mind than big nationwide names like American and United.  \nThe name Eastern puts the airline in the same category with Piedmont, Ozark, and Southern.  \nYou see what you expect to see. The passenger who has a bad experience on American or United says, “It was just one of those things.” An exception to the good service he or she was expecting.  \nThe passenger who has a bad experience on Eastern says, “It’s that Eastern Airlines again.” A continuation of the bad service he or she was expecting.  \nIt’s not that Eastern hasn’t tried. A number of years ago, Eastern brought in some big-league marketing people and pulled out the throttle. Eastern was among the first to “paint the planes,” “improve the food,” and “dress up the flight attendants” in an effort to improve its reputation.  \nAnd Eastern hasn’t been bashful when it comes to spending money. Year after year, it has one of the biggest advertising budgets in the industry. In a recent year, Eastern spent more than $70 million on advertising.  \nFor all the money, what do you think of Eastern? Where do you think they fly?

When prospects are given a choice, they are going to prefer the national airline, not the regional one.  \nThe airline’s problem is typical of the difficulty people have in separating reality from perception. Many experienced marketing people look at the Eastern situation and say, “It’s not the name that gets Eastern into trouble. It’s the poor service, the food, the baggage handling, the surly flight attendants.” The perception is the reality.  \nWhat do you think of Piedmont Airlines? How about Ozark Airlines?

Research indicates that they could reinvent the wheel and Goodyear would get most of the credit.\n\nNot surprisingly, B. F. Goodrich recognizes the problem. This is how they expressed it a number of years ago in an advertisement:\n\n> The curse of Benjamin Franklin Goodrich. His name. It’s one of fate’s cruel accidents that our biggest competitor’s name turns out to be almost identical to our founder’s. Goodyear. Goodrich. Awfully confusing.\n\nAt the bottom of the ad, it says: “If you want Goodrich, you’ll just have to remember Goodrich.”\n\nIn other words, it’s not Goodrich’s problem at all. It’s your problem.\n\nB. F. Goodrich was the first domestic company to market steel-belted radial-ply tires in the United States. Yet several years later when tire buyers were asked which company makes steel-belted radials, 56 percent named Goodyear, which didn’t make them for the domestic market. Only 47 percent said Goodrich, which did.\n\nAs they say in Akron, “Goodrich invents it. Firestone develops it. Goodyear sells it.”\n\nEvery year Goodyear increases its lead. Today it outsells Goodrich 3 to 1. So the rich get richer. Fair enough.\n\nBut what is odd is that the loser’s advertising continues to get all the publicity. “We’re the other guys” got a lot of favorable attention in the press. But not a lot of favorable attention from the tire-buying public.

It’s not some little kid who doesn’t know the score. Research indicates that the best Milk Duds prospect is a sophisticated candy buyer. He or she has been in and out of candy stores several hundred times at least.  \nThe average Milk Duds prospect is 10 years old.

Yet the obvious is easy to miss if you zero in too quickly on the product itself. (As with the “purloined letter” of Edgar Allan Poe, the obvious is often hard to find because it’s too easy to see. It’s too obvious.)  \nWhat’s in the prospect’s mind when the subject of candy comes up?

Put there, of course, by the millions of dollars’ worth of advertising spent on these and other candy bar brands.\n\n## Repositioning the competition\n\nSince Milk Duds was getting only a small fraction of that kind of advertising money, it would have been hopeless to try to build a separate identity for the brand.",

(Little would be gained by just putting another candy name in an overloaded mind.)  \nFortunately, there was a glaring weakness in the candy bar competition that could be exploited. And the weakness is obvious once you look at the size and shape and price of today’s Hershey bar.  \nA candy bar just doesn’t last very long.

As the candy bar has shrunk in size, this discontent has grown.  \n“My allowance doesn’t last very long when it comes to candy bars.”  \n“Either I’m eating faster or candy bars are getting smaller.”  \n“You can suck up a candy bar awfully fast these days!”  \nThis is the soft, chocolaty underbelly of the candy bar competition.  \nMilk Duds are different. They come in a box instead of a package. They give the kid 15 individual slow-eating chocolate-covered caramels.  \nCompared with a candy bar, a box of Milk Duds will last a long time.

Since the mind of the average skier can hold only a fraction of those names, the problem of positioning a ski resort can be difficult.\n\nIf your name is Stowe, the problem is greatly simplified. Stowe is already well known. “Stowe is for me the essential Eastern ski village,” said *Advertising Age* columnist James Brady, “the way Aspen is out west or Val d’Isere is in France or Kitzbühel is in Austria.”\n\n## Why a position for Stowe?\n\nWith that kind of reputation, why does Stowe need a position? Isn’t it enough to advertise Stowe and let the skier conjure up the Stowe image?\n\nTo a certain extent, this is true. The reputation of a product like Steinway or a place like Stowe creates word of mouth which carries the reputation along from year to year. But proper positioning can enhance the word of mouth and contribute to the process. In essence, the positioning supplies the material to talk about.\n\nWhat do skiers talk about? James Brady put it best. They talk about places to ski, places like Aspen, Val d’Isere, and Kitzbühel.\n\nWith this background in mind, the search began for a position for Stowe. The situation seemed to call for the outside expert, the person who could supply the credibility to bring a comparison claim to life.\n\n## The top 10 ski resorts in the world\n\nThe noted ski and travel writer, Abby Rand, supplied the credibility. Writing in *Harper’s Bazaar*, she selected the top 10 ski resorts in the world. One was Stowe, Vermont. The others were: Aspen, Colorado; Courchevel, France; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Kitzbühel, Austria; Portillo, Chile; St. Christoph, Austria; St. Moritz, Switzerland; Sun Valley, Idaho; and Vail, Colorado. (Not a bad list.) The positioning advertisements for Stowe used shoulder patches to illustrate the ski areas.\n\n“Of the world’s top 10 ski resorts,” said the ad, “only one is in the East.”\n\n“You don’t have to go to the Alps or the Andes or even to the Rockies to experience the ski vacation of a lifetime,” continued the ad. “You need only head for the Ski Capital of the East: Stowe, Vermont.”\n\nSkiers responded to the new Stowe strategy. They requested thousands of brochures in response to the advertising. They also broke all attendance records at the ski resort.",

Snow are all located south of Stowe. So the skier driving from the major population center (New York City) has to drive an hour or two longer to get to Stowe. One of the functions of the advertising is to promise the skier a reward for the longer drive.\n\n“One of the top 10 ski resorts in the world” is a classic positioning strategy. It takes advantage of the mind’s tendency to “make a list” when trying to cope with complexity. “The seven wonders of the world” is one of the earliest examples of this approach.\n\nFurthermore, the “top 10” strategy can conceivably be used indefinitely. There’s no reason to change. What better strategy can there be than having your place or product included in a list of the world’s best?\n\nWhen you use a recognized authority to give your product or service credibility, you are tapping a fundamental aspect of human nature. There’s security in not having to trust your own judgment.\n\nThe dark side of this tendency to defer to authority was explored by Allen Funt, creator of *Candid Camera*. “The worst thing, and I see it over and over,” said Mr. Funt, “is how easily people can be led by one kind of authority or even the most minimal signs of authority.”\n\n“We put up a sign on the road, *Delaware Closed Today,*” reported Mr. Funt. “Motorists didn’t question it. Instead they asked, ‘Is Jersey open?’” This book could have been written about religion just as well as about advertising.",

From divinity to clergy to congregation.  \nThe problems arise not with a perfect divinity or an imperfect congregation but with the clergy.  \nHow the clergy applies communication theory to the practice of religion will have a major influence on the way religion affects the congregation.\n\n## An identity crisis\n\nSome years ago, positioning thinking was applied to the Catholic Church. In other words, communication problems of this enormous institution were treated as if they belonged to a major corporation.  \nThis request did not come from the Pope or a committee of bishops. It came from a group of laity who were deeply concerned about what one renowned theologian dubbed a “certain crisis of identity” that had followed in the wake of the reforms of Vatican II.  \nIt was quickly apparent that communication in the Catholic Church was haphazard at best.  \nWhile much effort had been expended in improving techniques, the programs lacked a strong central theme or any continuity. (An especially serious problem in an era of electronic overcommunication.)  \nIt was like General Motors with no overall corporate advertising programs. All communication came from the local dealers. Some of it good, much of it bad.  \nA large measure of the problems could be traced to Vatican II.  \nPrior to that “opening of the windows,” the institutional Church had a clearly perceived position in the minds of the faithful. To most, the Church was the teacher of the law. Much emphasis was placed on rules, rewards, and punishment.\n\nThe Church was consistent in its approach to old and young alike.\n\nVatican II moved the Catholic Church away from this posture of law and order. Many rules and regulations were dismissed as unnecessary. Changes in liturgy and style became commonplace. Flexibility took the place of rigidity.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no advertising manager in Rome when these momentous changes were being made. No one to distill what had transpired and produce a program in simple language that explained the new directions.\n\nAfter years of not needing a “corporate” communication program, it’s understandable that the Catholic Church failed to recognize the scope of the problem on its hands.\n\n## Losing its influence\n\nWhat was painfully lacking was a clear presentation of what the new church was about.",

If you ask the top executives at General Motors, they will more than likely see their role as being the world’s largest manufacturer of automobiles. Companies spend millions finding and communicating the essence of their products with words like “Whiter than white” or “Fighting cavities is what Crest is all about.”  \nThe Church had to answer this unanswered question in simple, definitive terms. And it had to put this answer into a totally integrated communication program. Then it had to take this program to the flock in a new and dramatic way.  \nWorking out an identity program for a corporation usually entails a retracing of steps until you discover the basic business of a company. This requires poring over old plans and programs. Seeing what worked and what didn’t.  \nIn the case of the Catholic Church, you have to go back 2000 years and retrace the steps of the Church. Instead of old annual reports, you have to rely on Scripture.  \nIn the search for a simple, direct expression of the role of the Church, two explicit statements in the Gospel could hold the answer.  \nFirst, during Christ’s ministry on earth, God, as reported in Matthew’s Gospel, instructed man to listen to the words of his Son, the Beloved (Matt. 17:23).  \nThen Christ, as he departed from earth, instructed his followers to go and teach all nations what they had heard from him (Matt. 28:19).\n\n### Teacher of the word It’s apparent from the Scriptures that Christ saw the role of the Church as “teacher of the word.”",

Christ’s parables were not just for the people of his time, but also for now.  \nHence they must have in their construction a universality which would never become dated. They are simple and deep. In them Jesus gives to people of all ages food for thought and action.  \nSo it can be assumed that those who proclaim the message today can and should transmit the old message in a new form in their own locality, in their own time, in their own way.  \nThus the retracing of steps led to defining the role of the Church as that of keeping Christ alive in the minds of each new generation and relating his word to the problems of their time.  \nIn many ways Vatican II seemed to point the Church backward rather than forward. From “teacher of the law” to “teacher of the word.”  \nThis may seem like a very simplistic, almost obvious answer to a complicated problem.  \nAnd it is. Experience has shown that a positioning exercise is a search for the obvious. Those are the easiest concepts to communicate because they make the most sense to the recipient of a message.  \nUnfortunately, obvious concepts are also the most difficult to recognize and to sell.  \nThe human mind tends to admire the complicated and dismiss the obvious as being too simplistic. (For example, many clerics in the Catholic Church admire the definition of the role of the Church put forth by a noted theologian named Avery Dulles. His answer: The Church hasn’t one role. It has six different roles to play.)\n\n**Implementing the position**  \nOnce the obvious concept had been isolated, the next thing to be done was to develop the techniques for implementing it.  \nFirst and foremost was pulpit training. To fulfill the role of “teacher of the word,” the clergy had to become far better speakers and to give far better sermons. (Your best religious speakers today can be found not in church but on Sunday morning television.) In addition to pulpit training, an introductory film entitled *Return to the Beginning* was proposed.",

Simplicity is not as attractive as complexity.  \nAnd as with most big problems, they don’t go away. If you’ve been reading the newspapers, you’ve probably noted that the Pope is in the process of convening another synod to evaluate the results of Vatican II. The Vatican newspaper *L’Osservatore Romano* said that the synod’s purpose was to resolve confusion that has arisen over Vatican II in the 20 years since it ended.  \nWill they at long last acknowledge the confusion problems? Will they solve their “crisis of identity” and come up with a communications program that repositions the Church in the modern world? Will this program reconcile the widening gulf between liberal and conservative Catholics?  \nDon’t hold your breath.",

      "content": "What’s the difference between the positioning of a product (like Milk Duds) and the positioning of a service (like Western Union’s Mailgram)?  \nNot much, especially from a strategic point of view. Most of the differences are in techniques.\n\n## Visual vs. verbal  \nIn a product ad, the dominant element is usually the picture, the visual element. In a service ad, the dominant element is usually the words, the verbal element. (So if you saw an advertisement with a big picture of an automobile, you would assume the car was being advertised, not a car rental service.)  \nWith a product like Milk Duds, the primary medium was television, a visually oriented vehicle.  \nWith a service like Mailgram, the primary medium was radio, a verbally oriented vehicle.  \nNaturally, there are a lot of exceptions to these principles. If everyone knows what the product looks like, there is no advantage in using print, television, or other forms of visual media.  \nConversely, if a service can make effective use of a visual symbol (O. J. Simpson for Hertz, for example), then visual media can often be productive.  \nIn spite of the exceptions, it’s surprising how often these visual/verbal generalities hold up. In a four-way test of newspapers, magazines, radio, and television for Mailgram, the most effective medium was radio. But the essence of the Mailgram story is strategy, not media. Before discussing strategy, it may be helpful to take a look at how the system works.\n\n## Electronic mail  \nDeveloped jointly with the U.S. Postal Service and inaugurated on a limited experimental basis in 1970, Mailgram is the nation’s first electronic mail.\n\nTo send a Mailgram, you call Western Union, which transmits the message electronically to a post office near the recipient. The Mailgram is delivered the next business day.\n\nIn addition to sending Mailgrams by telephone, the customer can also send them by telex, TWX, magnetic tape, computer, facsimile equipment, or communicating typewriters.\n\nWhy belabor the technicalities? Why discuss the complex details of the Mailgram system?",

      "content": "To make an important point. Most advertising programs never go beyond the details of the product or service which is offered for sale. And the more interesting and complex the service is, the more likely this will happen. The marketing people who are responsible for introducing the product get all wrapped up in the service and forget all about the customer. As a matter of fact, the traditional approach would have been to introduce Mailgram as a “new, automated, computerized electronic communication service” or something of that sort. (Western Union spent millions on computer programming alone, not to mention the enormous expense of earth stations, satellites, etc.)\n\n## The low-cost telegram\n\nRegardless of how much money you spend, regardless of how technologically interesting your service is, to get inside the prospect’s mind, you have to relate to what’s already there. You can’t walk away from your existing position in the prospect’s mind.\n\nAnd what’s up there in the prospect’s mind? The Telegram, of course.\n\nAnytime you mention the word “Western Union,” the average mind conjures up the most famous yellow message in the history of the world. And the “gram” part of the Mailgram name only reinforces this perception.\n\nSo what’s the difference between the new gram and the old gram?\n\nWell, the main difference is price. Both have the same telegraphic format. Both demand immediate attention. But the yellow Telegram message is three times the price of the blue and white Mailgram message.\n\nSo the positioning theme developed for Mailgram was simple: “Mailgram: Impact of a Telegram at a fraction of the cost.”\n\nAt this point, someone said “Wait a minute. Why position Mailgram against the Telegram, also a Western Union service? Why take business away from ourselves?\n\n“Furthermore, the Telegram is a declining business. Why compare a new, modern service like Mailgram with an old service past its prime? The Telegram still has an important role to play, but it is not a growth business.”  \nThe logic is impeccable. But as often happens, logic is not necessarily the best strategy for dealing with human minds. Still, the logic was so sound, it was worthwhile rethinking the concept. Especially since there was another positioning strategy that also had merit.",

We could relate the Mailgram to the U.S. mail.  \nThen, too, if Western Union wanted the Mailgram to take business away from another service, the numbers suggest it would be much better to position the service against regular mail.  \nIn a recent year, 68 billion first-class letters were dropped into the nation’s letter boxes. That’s 815 first-class letters per household per year.  \nThe Telegram generates only a tiny fraction of that kind of volume.  \nSo a second theme was developed: “Mailgram: A new highspeed service for important messages.”  \nWhich is the better approach? In spite of the negatives, positioning theory suggests that the “low-cost Telegram” is a better direction than the “high-speed letter.” Yet Mailgram was too important to Western Union to make a decision based on judgment alone. So both campaigns were test-marketed using computer data to track results.\n\n## Low cost vs. high speed  \nThe test itself was a massive one. No tiny markets like Peoria were even considered. The six Mailgram test cities were Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. All big, important communication centers.  \nWho won? Actually both campaigns were effective. Here are the data for Mailgram volume increases in the test cities during the 13-week program.\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of two categories of cities, \"High-speed letter cities\" and \"Low-cost Telegram cities,\" each associated with a percentage increase. The \"High-speed letter cities\" are linked to a \"plus 73%\" increase, while \"Low-cost Telegram cities\" are associated with a \"plus 100%\" increase. The structure is comparative, highlighting a greater percentage increase for \"Low-cost Telegram cities\" relative to \"High-speed letter cities.\" The core components are the two city categories and their respective percentage gains, illustrating a difference in growth or impact between them.\n\nThese numbers alone were enough to prove the superiority of the “low-cost Telegram” position. But what really decided the issue were the product awareness levels in the test cities, which were measured both before the program ran and afterward.\n\nHere are the figures on how many people could correctly describe what a Mailgram was before the print and broadcast advertising began.",

In contrast, \"Low-cost Telegram cities\" constitute 23%, suggesting a segment of cities that rely on or are characterized by more traditional, potentially less expensive, communication methods. The structure is a simple comparison of two distinct categories of cities, highlighting their relative prevalence within an unspecified dataset.\n\nStatistically, not much difference. This indicates that the test market cities were pretty evenly matched. In other words, about one-fourth of the market already knew about the Mailgram service.\n\nAfter the advertising ran, however, there was a big difference in the two groups of cities. Here are the Mailgram awareness levels 13 weeks later.\n\nThis data presents a comparative analysis of two categories of cities based on their associated costs. \"High-speed letter cities\" represent 25% of the total, indicating a segment with a higher associated cost for letter delivery. Conversely, \"Low-cost Telegram cities\" constitute a larger portion at 47%, suggesting a segment where telegram delivery is more economically viable. The remaining 28% (100% - 25% - 47%) is not explicitly defined but is implied to represent other categories or a baseline. The structure is comparative, highlighting the differing cost profiles and market penetration of these two distinct communication service types within urban environments.\n\nAs unbelievable as it may seem, awareness in the high-speed letter cities actually declined. From 27 percent to 25 percent. (Not really statistically significant.)\n\nThen where did the increased volume come from in the high-speed letter cities? Obviously from people who knew what a Mailgram was and were reminded to use the service by the advertising.\n\nIt was a totally different story in the low-cost Telegram cities. Mailgram awareness more than doubled. From 23 percent to 47 percent.\n\nNot only was this a big jump, but the numbers suggest that Mailgram volume increases were likely to continue over a long period of time.\n\nWestern Union also measured Telegram volume in the test cities before, during, and after the advertising. They found that volume held fairly stable. In fact, the company felt that advertising the Mailgram as the low-cost Telegram helped rather than hurt Telegram volume.",

The volume numbers tell the story.\n\nThis data presents a comparative overview of the volume of something over two distinct, yet sequential, periods. The first period spans from 1972 to 1976, showing an increase in volume from 6 million to 25 million. The second period, from 1977 to 1981, continues this upward trend, with the volume escalating from 28 million to 41 million. The structure is comparative, highlighting the growth trajectory across these two five-year intervals, with a slight overlap in the starting point of the second period (28 million in 1977) compared to the end of the first (25 million in 1976), indicating sustained and accelerating growth.\n\nAfter 10 years of success, Western Union decided to change the Mailgram strategy. Instead of “impact,” the new strategy would emphasize “next-day delivery.” So they hired a new advertising agency to develop the new program.\n\nAgain, the volume numbers tell the story.\n\nThis data presents a chronological overview of a specific volume over a four-year period, from 1981 to 1984. The structure is comparative, highlighting changes in volume year-over-year. In 1981, the volume was recorded at 41 million. This figure subsequently decreased each year, reaching 37 million in 1982, then dropping to 30 million in 1983. The trend continued downwards, with the volume recorded at 22 million in 1984, indicating a consistent decline over the observed timeframe.\n\nRarely can you find such a clearcut example of the difference between good advertising strategy and bad. (Most examples are clouded by other factors.) But in the Mailgram case, the minute the strategy was changed, volume declined.\n\nYour problem is not just one of developing a good strategy. Equally important is the courage you will need to keep hammering at the same theme, year after year.",

Unlike a Mailgram, however, which is a national service, banking is still a regional service.  \nIn fact, positioning a bank is much like positioning a department store, an appliance store, or any other kind of retail establishment. To successfully position a retail outlet, you must know the territory.\n\n## The Long Island banking situation\n\nTo understand how we developed a position for the Long Island Trust Company, you should know a little bit about the territory.  \nFor many years Long Island Trust was the leading bank on the Island. It was the largest bank, it had the most branches, and it made the most money.  \nIn the seventies, however, the bank battlefield on Long Island changed dramatically. A new law permitted unrestricted branch banking throughout New York State.  \nSince then, many of the big New York City banks have become firmly entrenched in the Long Island area. Banks like Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Chemical Bank.  \nAlso, a good number of Long Island’s residents commute to New York City everyday and do part of their banking at these same banks.  \nHowever, the intrusion of the big city banks into Long Island Trust’s territory was only part of the problem. The territory that really counts is in the mind of the banking prospect. And a little research turned up a lot of bad news.\n\n## Mapping the prospect’s mind\n\nBy now you can appreciate the importance of knowing what’s in the prospect’s mind. Not only about your product or service, but about competitive offerings as well.\n\nOften the insights are intuitive. Nobody needs a $20,000 research project to know that Western Union is strongly identified with the Telegram. Nor was much research needed to determine the positions of Milk Duds, Belgium, and Xerox.\n\nMore often than not, however, it can be exceedingly helpful to map the prospect’s mind by means of formal positioning research. Helpful not only in developing a strategy, but in selling the strategy to top management. (The chief executive who has spent 30 years with one company will obviously see that company differently than a prospect whose total exposure over the same 30 years can be measured in minutes or even seconds.)",

In the due course of events the Jamaicans, encouraged by the Rockefeller committee, hired us to develop a position for the island of Jamaica.\n\n## Investment or tourism?  \nJamaica at the time needed both. But which should come first?  \nObviously, investments won’t do much for tourism, but many tourists work for big companies. If they come back from Jamaica with favorable impressions, they just might encourage their companies to invest in the island. Executives at those same companies like to invest in places that are fun to visit. Which is why you see so little investment in Alaska and so much in the Caribbean.  \nWho wants to go to Fairbanks in the wintertime to check out the plant?\n\n## The competition  \nLooking at the Caribbean from a tourist’s point of view, there are four major competitors to Jamaica: the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Bermuda. Each of these destinations draws more visitors a year than Jamaica.  \nWhat springs to mind when you mention any of these Caribbean islands? With one exception, the consistent visual image is the couple in the bathing suits on the beach, underneath the palm trees. (This sea, sand, and surf picture has become a visual cliché for the Caribbean.)  \nThe exception, of course, is Bermuda. Years of advertising those motorbikes parked beside the pink sand have put a strong visual in the mind.\n\nEffective, too. Our research shows that in terms of perceptions, Bermuda is second in desirability to the U.S. Virgin Islands. If it weren’t for the weather factor (Bermuda is considerably north of the other islands), Bermuda would have been in first place.\n\nJamaica’s positioning problem is similar to the problem of Belgium. How to put a mental picture postcard into the mind of the Caribbean prospect?\n\n## The search for the postcard\n\nThe first approach is to sort through thousands of postcards to find the one perfect picture of the island of Jamaica.

In other words, there would have been an image already burned into at least a few minds.\n\nThe second approach is to visit Jamaica and shoot hundreds or thousands of pictures trying to capture that illusive mental picture postcard. Not surprisingly, nothing totally right turns up.\n\nThe third approach is the one that should have been used first. It’s to look into the mind of the prospect to see what mental images already exist. And then select one you can tie Jamaica into.\n\nWhat is the verbal essence of Jamaica? An old advertisement said, “Jamaica is the big green island in the Caribbean that has deserted beaches, cool mountains, country pastures, open plains, rivers, rapids, waterfalls, ponds, good drinking water, and a jungly interior.”\n\nDoes that sound familiar? Does it remind you of a very popular tourist destination in the Pacific?\n\n## The Hawaiian connection\n\nThat’s right. Hawaii. Most people have a mental picture of the big green volcanic mountains coming down to the blue sea.\n\nIt’s a view that you can also see as you approach the island of Jamaica, the Hawaii of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Hawaii of the Caribbean becomes an even more powerful concept when you compare Jamaica with its four biggest competitors. This chart lists the highest point of each destination.\n\nThis data presents a comparative overview of Caribbean destinations, specifically highlighting their highest topographical points. The structure is a simple mapping of geographical locations to their maximum elevations. The destinations range from low-lying islands like Bermuda at 259 feet and the Bahamas at 400 feet, to progressively higher elevations. The U.S. Virgin Islands reach 1556 feet, Puerto Rico ascends to 4389 feet, and Jamaica represents the highest point among the listed locations at 7402 feet. This arrangement allows for a direct comparison of the relative mountainous terrain across these island territories.\n\nAt 7402 feet, Blue Mountain in Jamaica is higher than any point in the United States east of the Mississippi River.\n\nAnother important comparison is the size of each destination. This chart gives the length of the largest island in each destination.",

The structure is comparative, highlighting variations in island size across different geographical locations within the Caribbean region.\n\nAgain, Jamaica is considerably larger than any of its competitors. Jamaica has hundreds of miles of beaches and two volcanic mountain ranges with a towering peak over 7000 feet. This supports the “More to see, more to do” advantages that are also implicit in the Hawaiian connection.\n\nConceptually, this approach says to tourists that the things they travel a great distance to Hawaii for (natural beauty, big green mountains, beautiful beaches, wonderful year-round weather) can be found a lot closer to home, down in the Caribbean.\n\nJamaica could even copy one of the most successful of Hawaii’s marketing ploys: meeting tourists with flowers at the airport.\n\nJamaica has beautiful flowers and this gesture, above all, would say that Jamaica is a friendly place as well as a beautiful one.\n\n## Benefits of the “Hawaiian” position",

(There is no one positioning approach that will work everywhere.) There are many differences between the two banks, the most important being that unlike Long Island Trust, United Jersey is not the biggest local bank in its marketing territory. (That distinction belongs to First Fidelity with Midlantic in second place and United Jersey in third.)\n\n## Finding a viable banking position\n\nOne thing that United Jersey has in common with Long Island Trust is its marketing environment. Both operate in the shadows of Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover, and the other big New York City banks. That’s at the north end of the territory.  \nIn the south, United Jersey operates in the shadows of the big Philadelphia banks (Mellon, First Pennsylvania).  \nThe problem of finding a viable banking position is complicated by the fact that the services offered by United Jersey are similar to those of its competitors. Federal and state regulations see to that.  \nThe only approach that will work is the Tylenol approach. You don’t find the answer to the problem of positioning the bank by studying the bank. You find it by studying the competition, as Tylenol did by studying the problems of aspirin.  \nAt one end of the scale, United Jersey competes in the marketing jungle known as metropolitan New York City.  \nAnd it really is a banking jungle. In Manhattan alone, there are 389 banks. Not to mention Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and the entire state of New Jersey.  \nThe King and Queen of the jungle are Citibank and Chase Manhattan. These are big banks. In Manhattan alone Citibank has 74 branches.\n\nHow do you find weakness in Citibank, which has almost as many vice presidents as United Jersey has employees?\n\n## The disadvantage of large size\n\nThe problem of finding a meaningful advantage for United Jersey can be approached by looking at the disadvantages of its big-city competitors.\n\nWhy position United Jersey against the big banks? Why not take on the score of small financial institutions? The reason to go against the big banks is because they are the ones in the minds of the prospects. Positioning is always a question of dealing with what’s in the mind.",

We developed a positioning strategy for United Jersey called the “fast-moving bank.” This strategy had two key aspects.\n\n**A.** Exploit the only real weakness of the big metropolitan New York banks: their slow reaction time.\n\n**B.** Encourage United Jersey management to make sure the bank’s performance matches the advertising’s promise. That took the form of seven key commitments.\n\n1. **Decentralized decisions.** United Jersey pushed decision making down to the local level. (One of their lending teams can approve a $10 million loan, and that team meets daily.) In 10 commercial banking centers throughout the state, other officers on site can make business loans quickly.\n\n2. **Cross training.** United Jersey trains its people in all their banking services, not just in one specialty. So when a customer has a question, he or she doesn’t have to wait for an answer while the question is referred to another person.\n\n3. **Commitment to electronics.** United Jersey’s system of statewide ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines) is the largest private network in the state. United Jersey’s corporate customers can be on line directly with the bank’s computers for balance inquiries and other daily questions.\n\n4. **Speedy lock box service.** United Jersey people pick up checks six times a day during the workweek, four times on the weekend. Its Newark lock box has its own private ZIP Code. United Jersey empties lock boxes and fills up customer accounts as fast as it can.\n\n5. **FACT terminals.** (Fast Authorization of Cashless Transactions.) With these terminals now in place, merchants enjoy the benefit of rapid electronic approvals. And faster approvals with minimized risk mean improved cash flow.\n\n6. **Responsiveness.** Whether it’s being first with a new product or matching the competition’s rates, United Jersey is committed to being responsive to the customer’s financial needs.\n\n7. **Central location.** United Jersey built its new corporate headquarters in Princeton. From the geographic center of the state, United Jersey is less than an hour away from any of its business customers by car, even less by helicopter.\n\n## Advertising the fast-moving bank\n\nWhen the bank’s performance matched the promises the advertising was going to make, the advertising started to make the promises.

And in the third spot, a husband and wife found the bankers at Lethargic moving in slow motion on a simple installment loan.\n\nThe humorous vignettes drove home the point that United Jersey “values your time as much as your money.”\n\nPrint advertisements also carried the “fast-moving bank” theme. “Haste makes money” and “Banks shouldn’t hold up people,” were two typical headlines.\n\n“Time Is Money” desk signs were given to all United Jersey bank officers, a not-so-subtle reminder not to keep the customer sitting next to their desk waiting.\n\n# Did it work?\n\nBy all measurements the fast-moving bank strategy was a big success for United Jersey. Unaided awareness, for example, almost tripled in just over a year.\n\nBusiness and profits went up. A year after the program started, United Jersey announced earnings were up $30 million, an increase of 26 percent over the previous year.\n\nAn even more important barometer of change was the attitude of employees. One United Jersey officer reported, “The image advertising is great, but the best thing I’ve seen happen is that our people, line officers, etc., are striving to live up to Fast Moving … and they are! I’ve seen a tremendous change in attitude since the campaign began. Approvals come faster. People don’t sit on things.”\n\nThe essence of a good positioning strategy is that it transcends every aspect of a company.

Now the travelers are young and the flight attendants are old.\n\n## The Sabena situation\n\nOne of the many North Atlantic carriers jockeying for these international travelers is an airline called Sabena Belgian World Airlines. But all competitors don’t compete on an equal basis. TWA and Pan Am, for example, have for some time had a long list of gateway cities in both the United States and Europe.  \nBut Sabena flies nonstop from North America to only one city in Europe: Brussels. Unless there was a hijacker aboard, every Sabena plane was going to land in Belgium.  \nWhile Sabena captured the lion’s share of the traffic to Belgium, they were on a very meager diet. Not too many people were flying to this little country. Only one out of 50 North Atlantic passengers fly to Belgium.  \nOn the country ladder in the prospective traveler’s mind, Belgium was on one of the bottom rungs. If it was on the ladder at all.  \nOne look at the situation and it was easy to tell what was wrong with Sabena’s advertising. Sabena was using classic airline strategy. Sell the food and the service.  \n“Do I have to be a bon vivant to fly Sabena?” said a typical ad. But all the terrific food in the world won’t induce you to fly an airline that isn’t going where you want to go.\n\n**Position the country, not the airline** Sabena’s most productive strategy was obviously not to position the airline but to position the country.",

Not a place you traveled through to get to somewhere else.  \nFurthermore, there’s a moral here that shines through loud and clear. Whether you’re selling colas, companies, or countries. Out of mind, out of business.  \nMost Americans knew very little about Belgium. They thought Waterloo was a suburb of Paris and the most important product of Belgium was waffles. Many didn’t even know where the country was.  \n“If it’s Tuesday, this must be Belgium,” was the title of a popular motion picture.  \nBut how do you find a position for a country? Well, if you think about it, the most successful countries all have strong mental images.  \nSay “England” and people think of pageantry, Big Ben, and the Tower of London.  \nSay “Italy” and they think of the Coliseum and St. Peter’s and works of art.  \nSay “Amsterdam” and it’s tulips, Rembrandt, and those wonderful canals.  \nSay “France” and it’s food and the Eiffel Tower and the dazzling Riviera.  \nYour mind sees cities and countries as mental picture postcards. In your mind, New York is probably a skyline of tall buildings. San Francisco is cable cars and the Golden Gate Bridge. Cleveland is a gray place with a lot of industrial smokestacks.  \nObviously, London, Paris, and Rome are all top-of-the-ladder destinations that are most popular with first-time travelers to Europe. Sabena had little chance to get these travelers.  \nBut in the United States there is a large segment of seasoned travelers looking to visit the next tier of destinations. Countries like Greece with its ruins. Switzerland with its mountains.  \nOnce the objective became clear, finding a position wasn’t that difficult.\n\n# Beautiful Belgium\n\nBelgium is a beautiful country with many of the things that appeal to the seasoned European traveler. Like interesting cities, historical palaces, museums, and art galleries.\n\nOddly enough, many Belgian people don’t have a high opinion of their own country as a tourist attraction. That attitude is perhaps epitomized by a sign that used to be at the Brussels airport. Among other things it said,  \n“Welcome to Belga country.

Like London, Paris, and Rome. (If you want to visit New York, fly to Philadelphia because it’s close by.)\n\nThere’s an important lesson here. The perceptions of people living in a place are often different from those visiting it.\n\nMany New Yorkers fail to see New York as a tourist attraction. They remember the garbage strikes and forget the Statue of Liberty. Yet New York attracts 16 million visitors a year who all want to see those “big buildings.”\n\n## Three-star cities\n\nBut while “beautiful” was a good position, it wasn’t really enough as a tourist promotion theme. To position a country as a destination, you need attractions that will keep the traveler around for at least a few days.\n\nNobody considers Monaco much of a destination because its number one attraction, Monte Carlo, can be seen in an evening.\n\nObviously, size is an important factor. Big countries have lots of attractions. Small countries are at a disadvantage. (If the Grand Canyon ran through Belgium, you wouldn’t have much land left to look at.)\n\nWe found the answer to the overall positioning problem in one of those Michelin Guides. You may not know that Michelin rates cities as well as restaurants.\n\nMichelin’s Benelux edition lists six three-star “worth a special journey” cities. Five were in Belgium: Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, and Tournai.\n\nBut what was really surprising was the fact that the big tourist attraction to the North, Holland, had only one three-star city, Amsterdam.\n\nThe ad that resulted was headlined, “In beautiful Belgium, there are five Amsterdams.” The illustration was comprised of five beautiful four-color pictures of Belgium’s three-star cities.\n\nThis advertisement generated an enormous number of inquiries about a country many travelers had seen only through the train window as they traveled from Amsterdam to Paris.\n\nOne of the inquiries came in the form of a call from the minister of tourism in Holland to his counterpart in Belgium. Needless to say, there was one irate Dutchman who wanted that advertisement killed, along with the people who created it.\n\nThe “three-star city” strategy had three important things going for it.",

In any positioning program, if you can start with a strongly held perception, you’ll be that much ahead in your efforts to establish your own position.\n\nSecond, the Michelin Guide, another entity already in the mind of the traveler, gave the concept credibility.\n\nFinally, the “five cities to visit” made Belgium a bona fide destination.\n\nEventually the “three-star cities of beautiful Belgium” concept was moved into television. The response was substantial.\n\nA television commercial with its ability to communicate in sight and sound can drive pictures of a country into the mind much more quickly than a print advertisement.\n\nThere’s also a danger of misusing the medium of television. This happens when your visuals are similar to visuals being used by other countries.\n\nThink about those islands in the Caribbean you’ve seen advertised. Can you keep those palm trees and beaches separate in your mind? Do you conjure up the same mental postcard when someone says Nassau, the Virgin Islands, or Barbados? If there’s no difference, the mind will simply dump all those visuals in a slot marked “Islands in the Caribbean” and tune out.\n\nThe same thing can happen with those quaint European villages. Or the smiling residents waving mugs of beer at you. We solved the problem by using the Michelin “stars” as if they were church bells which rang out as they were superimposed on the Belgium city scenes.\n\n## What happened?\nNow you might be wondering why, after all this, you haven’t seen much about Belgium and its three-star cities.  \nA number of events kept this program from getting off the ground. All of which holds a lesson for anyone embarked on a positioning program.  \nNew management not committed to the program arrived on the scene, and when headquarters in Brussels wanted to change the strategy, they quickly acquiesced.  \nThe lesson here is that a successful positioning program requires a major long-term commitment by the people in charge. Whether it’s the head of a corporation, a church, an airline, or a country.  \nIn a constantly changing political environment, this is difficult to accomplish.",

Much better to think about your situation in an organized way before leaping to a conclusion.  \nTo help you with this thinking process, here are six questions you can ask yourself to get your mental juices flowing.  \nDon’t be deceived. The questions are simple to ask but difficult to answer. They often raise soul-searching issues that can test your courage and your beliefs.\n\n## 1. What position do you own?  \nPositioning is thinking in reverse. Instead of starting with yourself, you start with the mind of the prospect.  \nInstead of asking what you are, you ask what position you already own in the mind of the prospect.  \nChanging minds in our overcommunicated society is an extremely difficult task. It’s much easier to work with what’s already there.  \nIn determining the state of the prospect’s mind, it’s important not to let corporate egos get in the way. You get the answer to the question “What position do we own?” from the marketplace, not from the marketing manager.  \nIf this requires a few dollars for research, so be it. Spend the money. It’s better to know exactly what you’re up against now than to discover it later when nothing can be done about it.  \nDon’t be narrow-minded. You must look at the big picture, not the details.  \nSabena’s problem is not Sabena, the airline, but Belgium, the country.  \nSeven-Up’s problem is not the prospect’s attitude toward lemon/lime drinks, but the overwhelming share of mind occupied by the colas. “Get me a soda,” to many people, means a Coke or a Pepsi.\n\nLooking at the big picture helped Seven-Up develop its successful uncola program.  \nMost products today are like 7-Up before the uncola campaign. They have weak or nonexistent positions in the minds of most prospects.  \nWhat you must do is to find a way into the mind by hooking your product, service, or concept to what’s already there.",

What position do you want to own?  \nHere is where you bring out your crystal ball and try to figure out the best position to own from a long-term point of view. “Own” is the key word. Too many programs set out to communicate a position that is impossible to preempt because someone else already owns it.  \nFord failed to position the Edsel successfully. One reason was there simply was no room in the mind of the auto buyer for another heavily chromed, medium-priced car.  \nOn the other hand, when Richardson Merrill was trying to position an entry in the cold-remedy field against Contac and Dristan, it wisely avoided a direct confrontation. Leaving these two to fight it out in the daylight hours, Richardson Merrill chose to preempt the “nighttime cold remedy” position for Nyquil.  \nNyquil turned out to be the most successful new product they have introduced in recent years.  \nSometimes you can want too much. You can want to own a position that’s too broad. A position that can’t be established in the prospect’s mind. And even if it could, it couldn’t be defended against the assaults of narrowly based products like Nyquil.  \nThis, of course, is the everybody trap, and one example is a famous campaign for a beer called Rheingold. This brewery wanted to preempt New York City’s working class. (Not a bad objective when you consider the large number of heavy beer drinkers in this group.)  \nSo they produced some marvelous commercials featuring Italians drinking Rheingold, Blacks drinking Rheingold, Irish drinking Rheingold, Jews drinking Rheingold, and so on.  \nWell, rather than appeal to everybody, they ended up appealing to nobody. The reason was simple. Prejudice being a basic human commodity, the fact that one ethnic group drank Rheingold sure didn’t impress another ethnic group.\n\nIn fact, all the campaign did was alienate every ethnic group in New York.  \nIn your own career, it’s easy to make the same mistake. If you try to be all things to all people, you wind up with nothing. Better to narrow the focus of your expertise. To establish a unique position as a specialist, not as a jack-of-all-trades generalist.  \nThe job market today belongs to the people who can define and position themselves as specialists.",

It’s better to go around an obstacle rather than over it. Back up. Try to select a position that no one else has a firm grip on.  \nYou must spend as much time thinking about the situation from the point of view of your competitors as you do thinking about it from your own.  \nProspects don’t buy, they choose. Among brands of automobiles. Among brands of beer. Among brands of computers. The merit, or lack of merit, of your brand is not nearly as important as your position among the possible choices.  \nOften to create a viable position, you must reposition another brand or even an entire category of product. As Tylenol did to aspirin, for example.  \nNotice what happens when you fail to deal with the competition. Bristol-Myers spent $35 million to launch Nuprin, and American Home Products spent $40 million to launch Advil. Both products contain ibuprofen, an analgesic new to America.  \nBut both campaigns failed to reposition Tylenol, the dominant headache remedy on the market. As a result, neither product has been able to carve out more than a tiny market share.  \nComing to grips with the competition is the main problem in most marketing situations.\n\n### 4. Do you have enough money?\n\nA big obstacle to successful positioning is attempting to achieve the impossible. It takes money to build a share of mind. It takes money to establish a position. It takes money to hold a position once you’ve established it.\n\nThe noise level today is fierce. There are just too many me-too products and too many me-too companies vying for the mind of the prospect. Getting noticed is getting tougher.\n\nDuring the course of a single year, the average human mind is exposed to some 200,000 advertising messages. When you remember that a 30-second $500,000 Super Bowl commercial can make only one of those 200,000 impressions, the odds against an advertiser today must be seen as enormous.\n\nThis is why a company like Procter & Gamble is such a formidable competitor. When it bets on a new product, it will slide $50 million on the table, look around at the competition, and say, “Your bet.”",

One way to cope with the noise-level problem is to reduce the geographic scope of your problem. To introduce new products or new ideas on a market-by-market basis rather than nationally or even internationally.\n\nWith a given number of dollars, it’s better to overspend in one city than to underspend in several cities. If you become successful in one location, you can always roll out the program to other places. Provided the first location is appropriate.\n\nIf you can become the No. 1 scotch in New York (the No. 1 scotch-drinking area of the country), you can roll out the product to the rest of the U.S.A.\n\n## 5. Can you stick it out?\n\nYou can think of our overcommunicated society as a constant crucible of change. As one idea replaces another in bewildering succession.\n\nTo cope with change, it’s important to take a long-range point of view. To determine your basic position and then stick to it.\n\nPositioning is a concept that is cumulative. Something that takes advantage of advertising’s long-range nature.\n\nYou have to hang in there, year after year. Most successful companies rarely change a winning formula. How many years have you seen those Marlboro men riding into the sunset? Crest has been fighting cavities for so long they’re into their second generation of kids. Because of change, a company must think even more strategically than it did before.\n\nWith rare exceptions, a company should almost never change its basic positioning strategy. Only its tactics, those short-term maneuvers that are intended to implement a longterm strategy.\n\nThe trick is to take that basic strategy and improve it. Find new ways to dramatize it. New ways to avoid the boredom factor. In other words, new ways to have Ronald McDonald end up eating a hamburger.\n\nOwning a position in the mind is like owning a valuable piece of real estate. Once you give it up, you might find it’s impossible to get it back again.\n\nThe line-extension trap is a good example. What you are really doing when you line-extend is weakening your basic position. And once that’s gone, you are adrift without an anchor.",

Do you match your position?\n\nCreative people often resist positioning thinking because they believe it restricts their creativity.\n\nAnd you know what? It does. Positioning thinking does restrict creativity.\n\nOne of the great communication tragedies is to watch an organization go through a careful planning exercise, step by step, complete with charts and graphs and then turn the strategy over to the “creatives” for execution. They, in turn, apply their skills and the strategy disappears in a cloud of technique, never to be recognized again.\n\nAn institution like this would have been much better off running the flip-chart with the strategy on it rather than the ad with thousands of dollars worth of creativity applied.\n\n“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.” This doesn’t sound like an ad. It sounds like the presentation of the marketing strategy. In truth, it’s both.\n\nDo your advertisements for yourself match your position? Do your clothes, for example, tell the world that you’re a banker or a lawyer or an artist?  \nOr do you wear creative clothes that undermine your position?  \nCreativity by itself is worthless. Only when it is subordinated to the positioning objective can creativity make a contribution.\n\n**The role of the outsider**  \nThe question sometimes arises: Do we do it ourselves or do we hire someone to position us?  \nThe someone that often gets hired is an advertising agency. An ad agency? Who needs help from those Madison Avenue hucksters?  \nEverybody. But only the rich can afford to hire an advertising agency. All the others have to learn how to do it themselves. Have to learn how to apply the invaluable ingredient only available from the outsider.  \nAnd what does the outsider supply? An ingredient called ignorance. In other words, objectivity.  \nBy not knowing what goes on inside a company, the outsider is better able to see what is happening on the outside. In the mind of the prospect.  \nThe outsider is naturally attuned to outside-in thinking, while the insider is more comfortable with inside-out thinking.  \nObjectivity is the key ingredient supplied by the advertising or marketing communication or public relations agency.",

People suffer from the same disease as products. They try to be all things to all people.  \nThe problem with this approach is the mind of the prospect. It’s difficult enough to link one concept with each product. It’s almost impossible with two or three or more concepts.  \nThe most difficult part of positioning is selecting that one specific concept to hang your hat on. Yet you must, if you want to cut through the prospect’s wall of indifference.  \nWhat are you? What is your own position in life? Can you sum up your own position in a single concept? Then can you run your own career to establish and exploit that position?  \nMost people aren’t ruthless enough to set up a single concept for themselves. They vacillate. They expect others to do it for them.  \n“I’m the best lawyer in Dallas.”  \nAre you? How often would your name be mentioned if we took a survey of the Dallas legal community?  \n“I’m the best lawyer in Dallas” is a position that can be achieved with some talent, some luck, and a lot of strategy. And the first step is to isolate the concept that you are going to use to establish that long-term position. It’s not easy. But the rewards can be great.\n\n## Make mistakes Anything worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.\n\nIf it wasn’t worthwhile doing, you shouldn’t have done it at all.  \nOn the other hand, if it is worthwhile doing and you wait until you can do it perfectly, if you procrastinate, you run the risk of not doing it. Ever.  \nTherefore, anything worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.  \nYour reputation will probably be better within the company if you try many times and succeed sometimes than if you fear failure and only try for sure things.  \nPeople still remember Ty Cobb, who stole 96 bases out of 134 tries (70 percent). But they have forgotten Max Carey, who stole 51 bases out of 53 (96 percent).  \nEddie Arcaro, perhaps the greatest jockey who ever rode a horse, had 250 straight losers before he rode his first winner.",

He deserves a separate identity.  \nIn show business, where you must burn a clearcut identity in the mind of the public, even a famous last name should probably not be used.  \nToday Liza Minnelli is a bigger star than her mother, Judy Garland, ever was. As Liza Garland, she would have started with a handicap.  \nFrank Sinatra, Jr., is an example of the most difficult kind of line-extension name. He literally started with two strikes against him.  \nWith a name like Frank Sinatra, Jr., the audience says to itself, “He’s not going to be able to sing as well as his father.” Since you hear what you expect to hear, of course he doesn’t.",

      "content": "## Find a horse to ride\nSome ambitious, intelligent people find themselves trapped in situations where their future looks bleak. So what do they generally do?  \nThey try harder. They try to compensate by long hours of hard work and effort. The secret of success is to keep your nose to the grindstone, do your job better than the next person, and fame and fortune will come your way, right?  \nWrong. Trying harder is rarely the pathway to success. Trying smarter is the better way.  \nIt’s the story of the shoemaker’s children all over again. Too often, management people don’t know how to manage their own careers.  \nTheir own promotional strategy is often based on the naive assumption that ability and hard work are all that counts. And so they dig in and work harder, waiting for the day that someone will tap them on the shoulder with the magic wand.  \nBut that day seldom comes.  \nThe truth is, the road to fame and fortune is rarely found within yourself. The only sure way to success is to find yourself a horse to ride. It may be difficult for the ego to accept, but success in life is based more on what others can do for you than on what you can do for yourself.  \nKennedy was wrong. Ask not what you can do for your company. Ask what your company can do for you. Therefore, if you want to take maximum advantage of the opportunities that your career has to offer, you must keep your eyes open and find yourself a horse to do the job for you. **The first horse to ride is your company.** Where is your company going? Or more impolitely, is it going anywhere at all?  \nToo many good people have taken their good prospects and locked them into situations that are doomed to failure. But failure at least gives you a second chance. Even worse is the company with less than average chances for growth.  \nNo matter how brilliant you are, it never pays to cast your lot with a loser. Even the best officer on the Titanic wound up in the same lifeboat as the worst. And that’s if he was lucky enough to stay out of the water.",

So look at banks, leasing, insurance, medical, financial, and consulting service companies.\n\nDon’t forget that your experience with yesterday-type products can blind you to opportunities in totally different product areas. And especially services.\n\nAnd when you change jobs to join one of those tomorrow-type companies, don’t just ask how much they are going to pay you today.\n\nAlso ask how much they are likely to pay you tomorrow.\n\n**The second horse to ride is your boss.** Ask yourself the same questions about your boss as you asked yourself about your company.\n\nIs he or she going anywhere?

He or she will often say, “You people really need me around here. You’re weak in my specialty.”\n* The other type says just the opposite. “You’re strong in my specialty. You do a terrific job, and I want to work with the best.”\n\nWhich type is more likely to get the job? Right. The latter person.\n\nOn the other hand, strange as it might seem, top management people see more of the other type. The person who wants to be an expert.

Even better advice now.  \n> If your boss is going places, chances are good that you are too.\n\n**The third horse to ride is a friend.** Many business people have an enormous number of personal friends but no business friends. And while personal friends are awfully nice to have and can sometimes get you a deal on a TV set or braces for the kids, they’re usually not too helpful when it comes to finding a better job.\n\nMost of the big breaks that happen in a person’s career happen because a business friend recommended that person.\n\nThe more business friends you make outside of your own organization, the more likely you are to wind up in a big, rewarding job.\n\nIt’s not enough just to make friends. You have to take out that friendship horse and exercise it once in a while. If you don’t you won’t be able to ride it when you need it.\n\nWhen an old business friend you haven’t heard from in 10 years calls you and wants to have lunch, you know two things will happen: (1) you’re going to pay for the lunch, and (2) your friend is looking for a job.\n\nWhen you need a job, it’s usually too late to try that type of tactic. The way to ride the friendship horse is to keep in touch regularly with all your business friends.\n\nSend them tear sheets of articles they may be interested in, clips of publicity items, and congratulatory letters when they get promoted.\n\nAnd don’t assume people always see stories that might have mentioned them. They don’t. And they always appreciate it when someone sends them an item they may have missed.\n\n**The fourth horse to ride is an idea.** On the night before he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, “Nothing, not all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come.”\n\nEveryone knows that an idea can take you to the top faster than anything else. But people sometimes expect too much of an idea. They want one that is not only great, but one that everyone else thinks is great too.\n\nThere are no such ideas. If you wait until an idea is ready to be accepted, it’s too late. Someone else will have preempted it.",

You must be willing to go against the tide.  \nYou can’t be first with a new idea or concept unless you are willing to stick your neck out. And take a lot of abuse. And bide your time until your time comes.  \n“One indication of the validity of a principle,” according to psychologist Charles Osgood, “is the vigor and persistence with which it is opposed.” “In any field,” says Dr. Osgood, “if people see that a principle is obvious nonsense and easy to refute, they tend to ignore it. On the other hand, if the principle is difficult to refute and it causes them to question some of their own basic assumptions with which their names may be identified, they have to go out of their way to find something wrong with it.”  \nNever be afraid of conflict.  \nWhere would Winston Churchill have been without Adolf Hitler? We know the answer to that one. After Adolf Hitler was disposed of, at the very first opportunity the British public promptly turned Winston Churchill out of office.  \nAnd you remember what Liberace said about the bad reviews one of his concerts received. “I cried all the way to the bank.”  \nAn idea or concept without an element of conflict is not an idea at all. It’s motherhood, apple pie, and the flag, revisited.  \n**The fifth horse to ride is faith.** Faith in others and their ideas. The importance of getting outside of yourself, of finding your fortune on the outside, is illustrated by the story of a man who was a failure most of his life.  \nHis name was Ray Kroc, and he was a lot older than most people and a failure to boot when he met two brothers who changed his life.  \nFor the brothers had an idea, but no faith. So they sold their idea as well as their name to Ray Kroc for relatively few dollars.  \nRay Kroc became one of the richest people in America. Worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  \nThe brothers? They were the McDonald brothers, and every time you eat one of their hamburgers, remember it was the vision, courage, and persistence of the outsider who made the McDonald’s chain a success.

They let Mr. Webster rule their life.\n\n## You must understand the role of words\n\nAs general semanticists have been saying for decades, words don’t contain meanings. The meanings are not in the words. They are in the people using the words.  \nLike a sugar bowl which is empty until someone fills it with sugar, a word has no meaning until someone uses it and fills it with meaning.  \nIf you try to add sugar to a leaky sugar bowl, you won’t get anywhere. So, too, if you try to add meaning to a leaky word. Much better to discard that leaky word and use another.  \nThe word “Volkswagen” won’t hold the concept of a medium-sized luxury car, so you discard that sugar bowl and use another, “Audi,” which holds the concept better. You don’t insist that because it’s made in a Volkswagen factory, it must be a Volkswagen. Mental rigidity is a barrier to successful positioning.  \n(While Volkswagen faltered in the American market, Audi boomed. Currently Audi outsells BMW and is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz.)  \nTo be successful today at positioning, you must have a large degree of mental flexibility. You must be able to select and use words with as much disdain for the history book as for the dictionary.  \nNot that conventional, accepted meanings are not important. Quite the contrary. You must select the words which trigger the meanings you want to establish.  \nBut is this ethical? Remember, words have no meaning. They are empty containers until you fill them with meaning. If you want to reposition a product, a person, or a country, you often have to first change the container.\n\nIn a sense, every product or service is “packaged goods.” If it isn’t sold in a box, the name becomes the box.",

They trigger the meanings which are buried in the mind.  \nOf course, if people understood this, there would be no advantage in renaming a product or selecting emotional words like Mustang for an automobile.  \nBut they don’t. Most people are “unsane.” They’re not completely sane and they’re not completely insane. They’re somewhere in between.  \nWhat’s the difference between sane people and insane people? What exactly do insane people do? Alfred Korzybski, who developed the concept of general semantics, explains that insane people try to make the world of reality fit what is in their heads.  \nThe insane person who thinks he is Napoleon makes the outside world fit that notion.  \nThe sane person constantly analyzes the world of reality and then changes what’s inside his or her head to fit the facts.  \nThat’s an awful lot of trouble for most people. Besides, how many people want to constantly change their opinions to fit the facts?  \nIt’s a whole lot easier to change the facts to fit your opinions.  \nUnsane people make up their minds and then find the facts to “verify” their opinion. Or even more commonly, they accept the opinion of the nearest “expert,” and then they don’t have to bother with the facts at all.  \nSo you see the power of the psychologically right name. The mind makes the world of reality fit the name. A Mustang looks sportier, racier, and faster than if the same car had been called the Turtle.  \nLanguage is the currency of the mind. To think conceptually, you manipulate words. With the right choice of words, you can influence the thinking process itself. (As proof that the mind “thinks with words” and not abstract thoughts, consider how a language is learned. To be really fluent in a foreign language, say French, you must learn to think in French.)  \nBut there are limits. If a word is so far out of touch with reality, the mind just refuses to use the word. It says “large” on the tube that everyone except the manufacturer calls a “small” toothpaste tube.\n\nIt says “economy” on the tube that everyone calls “large.”  \nThe People’s Republic of China is usually called “Red China” because no one believes it is a “people’s republic.” (Inside the country, the People’s Republic of China is undoubtedly an effective name.)",

It only clouds the issue.  \nOne of the most critical aspects of positioning is being able to evaluate products objectively and see how they are viewed by customers and prospects.  \nYou also have to remember that you can’t play basketball without a backboard. You need someone to bounce your ideas off. As soon as you think you have found that simple idea that is the solution to your problem, you have lost something.  \nYou have lost your objectivity. You need the other person to take a fresh look at what you have wrought. And vice versa.  \nLike Ping-Pong, positioning is a game best played by two people. It’s no accident that this book was written by two people. Only in a give-and-take atmosphere can ideas be refined and perfected.\n\n**You need simplicity**  \nOnly an obvious idea will work today. The overwhelming volume of communication prevents anything else from succeeding.  \nBut the obvious isn’t always so obvious. “Boss” Kettering had a sign which he placed on the wall of the General Motors Research Building in Dayton: “This problem when solved will be simple.”  \n“Raisins from California. Nature’s candy.”  \n“Moist and meaty Gainesburgers. The canned dog food without the can.”  \n“Bubble Yum. Number yum in bubble gum.” These are the kinds of simple ideas that work today.\n\nSimple concepts expressed with simple words used in a straightforward way.  \nOften the solution to a problem is so simple that thousands of people have looked at it without seeing it. When an idea is clever or complicated, however, we should be suspicious. It probably won’t work because it’s not simple enough.  \nThe history of science is a history of the Ketterings of this world who found simple solutions to complex problems.  \nThe head of an advertising agency once insisted that his account executives paste down the marketing strategy on the back of each layout.  \nThen when the client asked what the ad was supposed to do, the account person could turn the layout over and read the strategy.  \nBut an ad should be simple enough so that it is the strategy.  \nThe agency made a mistake. It ran the wrong side of the layout.",

      "content": "### You need subtlety  \nBeginners who play the positioning game often remark, “How easy this is. You just find a position you can call your own.”  \nSimple, yes. But easy, no.  \nThe difficulty is finding an open position that’s also effective. In politics, for example, it’s easy to establish a position to the far right (a conservative position) or the far left (a socialist position). You will undoubtedly preempt either position.  \nYou will also lose.  \nWhat you must do is to find an opening near the center of the spectrum. You must be slightly conservative in a field of liberals or slightly liberal in a field of conservatives.  \nThis calls for great restraint and subtlety. The big winners in business and in life are those people who have found open positions near the center of the spectrum. Not at the edge.  \nYou can sometimes have a positioning success and a sales failure. This might be termed “Rolls-Royce thinking.”  \n“We’re the Rolls-Royce of the industry” is a claim you often hear in business today.  \nDo you know how many Rolls-Royces are sold in America every year?\n\nAbout a thousand, or 0.01 percent of the market. Cadillac, on the other hand, sells more than 300,000.  \nBoth Cadillac and Rolls-Royce are luxury cars, but the gulf between them is enormous. To the average automobile buyer, the Rolls-Royce at $100,000 and up is out of reach.  \nCadillac, like Michelob and other premium products, is not. The secret to establishing a successful position is to keep two things in balance: (1) A unique position with (2) an appeal that’s not too narrow.\n\n## You must be willing to sacrifice  \nThe essence of positioning is sacrifice. You must be willing to give up something in order to establish that unique position.  \n* Nyquil, the nighttime cold medicine, gave up the daytime market.  \nThe focus of most marketing operations is just the opposite. They look for ways to broaden their markets by line extension, by size and flavor proliferation, by multiple distribution. All these things tend to produce short-term sales increases and long-term positioning erosion.  \nIn positioning, smaller may be better. It is usually better to look for smaller targets that you can own exclusively rather than a bigger market you have to share with three or four other brands.  \nYou can’t be all things to all people and still have a powerful position.",

      "content": "## You need patience  \nVery few companies can afford to launch a new product on a nationwide scale.  \nInstead they look for places to make the brand successful. And then roll it out to other markets.  \nThe geographic roll-out is one way. You build the product in one market and then move on to another. From east to west. Or vice versa.  \nThe demographic roll-out is another. Philip Morris built Marlboro into the No. 1 cigarette on college campuses long before it became the No. 1 brand nationwide.  \nThe chronologic roll-out is the third way. You build the brand among a specific age group and then roll it out to others. “The Pepsi Generation” helped Pepsi-Cola build the product among the younger set and then reap the benefits as they grew up.\n\nDistribution is another roll-out technique. The Wella line was first sold through beauty salons. After the products were established, they were sold through drugstores and supermarkets.\n\n### You need a global outlook  \nDon’t overlook the importance of worldwide thinking. A company that keeps its eye on Tom, Dick, and Harry is going to miss Pierre, Hans, and Yoshio.  \nMarketing is rapidly becoming a worldwide ballgame. A company that owns a position in one country now finds that it can use that position to wedge its way into another. IBM has some 60 percent of the German computer market. Is this fact surprising? It shouldn’t be. IBM earns more than 50 percent of its profits outside the United States.  \nAs companies start to operate on a worldwide basis, they often discover they have a name problem.  \nA typical example is U.S. Rubber, a worldwide company that marketed many products not made of rubber. Changing the name to Uniroyal created a new corporate identity that could be used worldwide.",

      "content": "### What you don’t need  \nYou don’t need a reputation as a marketing genius. As a matter of fact, this could be a fatal flaw.  \nAll too often, the product leader makes the fatal mistake of attributing its success to marketing skill. As a result, it thinks it can transfer that skill to other products and other marketing situations.  \nWitness, for example, the disappointing record of Xerox in computers.  \nAnd the mecca of marketing knowledge, International Business Machines Corporation, hasn’t done much better. So far, IBM’s plain-paper copier hasn’t made much of a dent in Xerox’s business. Touché.  \nThe rules of positioning hold for all types of products. In the packaged-goods area, for example, Bristol-Myers tried to take on Crest toothpaste with Fact (killed after $5 million was spent on promotion). Then they tried to go after Alka-Seltzer with Resolve (killed after $11 million was spent).\n\nThen they tried to unseat Bayer with Dissolve, another financial headache.  \nThe suicidal bent of companies that go head-on against established competition is hard to understand.  \nHope springs eternal in the human breast. Nine times out of ten, the also-ran that sets out to attack the leader head-on is headed for disaster.  \nTo repeat, the first rule of positioning is: To win the battle for the mind, you can’t compete head-on against a company that has a strong, established position. You can go around, under or over, but never head to head.  \nThe leader owns the high ground. The No. 1 position in the prospect’s mind. The top rung of the product ladder. To move up the ladder, you must follow the rules of positioning.  \nIn our overcommunicated society, the name of the game today is positioning.  \nAnd only the better players are going to survive.",
