“Nobody would pay 5 cents for a plain-paper copy when they could get a coated-paper copy for a cent and a half.” Logical enough. But the essence of covering is protection against the unexpected.  
And the unexpected did happen. Haloid took a chance on the Carlson patents, and today the company (successively Haloid Xerox and then Xerox) is a $9 billion giant. Bigger than 3M and only a step behind Kodak. *Fortune* calls the Xerox 914 plain-paper copier “probably the single most profitable product ever manufactured in the United States.”  
And what did Xerox do for an encore?  
Almost nothing. The spectacular success of the 914 was followed by one failure after another. Most notably in computers.

### Power from the product  
“Only when our office copying success has been repeated, not once, but several times,” said the Xerox chairman early on in the company’s diversification game, “can we fairly reach the conclusion that this organization has the kind of power that can be relied upon again and again.”  
This is the classic mistake made by the leader. The illusion that the power of the product is derived from the power of the organization.  
It’s just the reverse. The power of the organization is derived from the power of the product, the position that the product owns in the prospect’s mind.  
Coca-Cola has power. The Coca-Cola Company is merely a reflection of that power.  
Outside the cola field, the Coca-Cola Company has to earn its power the hard way—either by getting into the mind first, by establishing a strong alternative position, or by repositioning the leader.  
So Coca-Cola’s Mr. Pibb runs a poor second to Dr. Pepper, and all the power of the Coca-Cola Company can’t do much about it.  
So, too, with Xerox. The power is in the position that Xerox owns in the mind. Xerox means copier. Xerox owns the copier position because it got into the mind first and then exploited that copier position by a massive marketing program.  
But in computers, office duplicators, word processors, and other products, Xerox starts at ground zero. Xerox has obviously tried to duplicate its copier success in other fields.
