“Furthermore, the Telegram is a declining business. Why compare a new, modern service like Mailgram with an old service past its prime? The Telegram still has an important role to play, but it is not a growth business.”  
The logic is impeccable. But as often happens, logic is not necessarily the best strategy for dealing with human minds. Still, the logic was so sound, it was worthwhile rethinking the concept. Especially since there was another positioning strategy that also had merit.

## The high-speed letter  
Actually the Mailgram name itself suggests a second positioning approach. We could relate the Mailgram to the U.S. mail.  
Then, too, if Western Union wanted the Mailgram to take business away from another service, the numbers suggest it would be much better to position the service against regular mail.  
In a recent year, 68 billion first-class letters were dropped into the nation’s letter boxes. That’s 815 first-class letters per household per year.  
The Telegram generates only a tiny fraction of that kind of volume.  
So a second theme was developed: “Mailgram: A new highspeed service for important messages.”  
Which is the better approach? In spite of the negatives, positioning theory suggests that the “low-cost Telegram” is a better direction than the “high-speed letter.” Yet Mailgram was too important to Western Union to make a decision based on judgment alone. So both campaigns were test-marketed using computer data to track results.

## Low cost vs. high speed  
The test itself was a massive one. No tiny markets like Peoria were even considered. The six Mailgram test cities were Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. All big, important communication centers.  
Who won? Actually both campaigns were effective. Here are the data for Mailgram volume increases in the test cities during the 13-week program.
