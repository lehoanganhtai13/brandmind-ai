# Positioning an island: Jamaica

When Edward Seaga replaced socialist Michael Manley as Jamaican prime minister, he proclaimed an open door for capitalist investment.  
David Rockefeller was so impressed, he formed a group of 25 American corporate chiefs specifically for the purpose of developing Jamaica. In the due course of events the Jamaicans, encouraged by the Rockefeller committee, hired us to develop a position for the island of Jamaica.

## Investment or tourism?  
Jamaica at the time needed both. But which should come first?  
Obviously, investments won’t do much for tourism, but many tourists work for big companies. If they come back from Jamaica with favorable impressions, they just might encourage their companies to invest in the island. Executives at those same companies like to invest in places that are fun to visit. Which is why you see so little investment in Alaska and so much in the Caribbean.  
Who wants to go to Fairbanks in the wintertime to check out the plant?

## The competition  
Looking at the Caribbean from a tourist’s point of view, there are four major competitors to Jamaica: the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Bermuda. Each of these destinations draws more visitors a year than Jamaica.  
What springs to mind when you mention any of these Caribbean islands? With one exception, the consistent visual image is the couple in the bathing suits on the beach, underneath the palm trees. (This sea, sand, and surf picture has become a visual cliché for the Caribbean.)  
The exception, of course, is Bermuda. Years of advertising those motorbikes parked beside the pink sand have put a strong visual in the mind.
