A company has no hope to make progress head-on against the position that IBM has established. And history, so far, has proved this to be true.

The small companies in the field probably recognize this. But the big companies seem to think they can take their strong positions against IBM. Well, as one unhappy executive was heard to say, “There just isn’t enough money in the world.” You can’t get there from here.

“Fight fire with fire” is the old cliché. But as the late Howard Gossage used to say, “That’s silly. You fight fire with water.”

A better strategy for IBM’s competitors would be to take advantage of whatever positions they already own in the minds of their prospects and then relate them to a new position in computers. For example, how should RCA have positioned its computer line?

Our 1969 article made a suggestion: “RCA is a leader in communications. If they positioned a computer line that related to their business in communications, they could take advantage of their own position. Even though they would be ignoring a great deal of business, they would be establishing a strong beachhead.”

Take General Electric, a company that is a big user of computers. Time sharing was the big technological topic of the day. If GE had concentrated on time-sharing computers, they too might have succeeded in the computer field. (Actually, the only computer operation General Electric didn’t sell to Honeywell was their time-sharing network, which remains profitable to this day.)

Take NCR, a company with a strong position in cash registers.

NCR has made great progress in the computer business by concentrating its efforts on retail data entry systems. Computerized cash registers, if you will.

Where the situation is hopeless, however, the effort in finding a valid position is probably wasted. Much better to concentrate on other areas of a company’s business. As Charlie Brown said, “No problem is too big to run away from.”

In truth, outright failure is often preferable to mediocre success.

An also-ran can easily be tempted to think that the answer to the problem is trying harder. A company stuck with a losing position is not going to benefit much from hard work.
