Today it’s 15 times as much. (Inflation accounts for part of this increase, but volume is also up substantially.)

Do you know 15 times as much about the products you buy? You may be exposed to much more advertising, but your mind can’t absorb any more than it used to. There’s a finite limit to how much you can take in, and advertising, even at $25 a year, was already way over the limit. That 1-quart container that sits on top of your neck can hold just so much.

At $376 per person, the average American consumer is already exposed to twice as much advertising per year as the average Canadian. Four times as much as the average English person. And five times as much as the average French person.

While no one doubts the advertiser’s financial ability to dish it out, there’s some question about the consumer’s mental ability to take it all in.

Each day, thousands of advertising messages compete for a share of the prospect’s mind. And make no mistake about it, the mind is the battleground. Between 6 inches of gray matter is where the advertising war takes place. And the battle is rough, with no holds barred and no quarter given.

Advertising is a brutal business where mistakes can be costly. But out of the advertising wars, principles have been developed to help you cope with our overcommunicated society.

**The product explosion**  
Another reason our messages keep getting lost is the number of products we have invented to take care of our physical and mental needs.

Take food for example. The average supermarket in the United States has some 12,000 individual products or brands on display. For the consumer, there’s no relief in sight. In fact, the product explosion could get worse. In Europe they are building super-supermarkets (called hypermarkets) with room for several times as many products. Biggs in Cincinnati, the first hypermarket in America, stocks 60,000 products.

The packaged-goods industry obviously expects the proliferation to continue. Those scratch marks on the side of most grocery boxes, the Universal Product Code, represent 10 digits. (Your social security number has only 9. And the system is designed to handle more than 200 million people.) And this same situation holds in the industrial field.
