“Ban is more effective than Right Guard, Secret, Sure, Arrid Extra Dry, Mitchum, Soft & Dry, Body All, and Dial,” said a recent Ban ad. The reader looks at an ad like this and asks, “What else is new?”

## Is repositioning legal?  
If disparagement were illegal, every politician would be in jail. (And many husbands and wives would be in deep trouble too.)  
Actually, the Federal Trade Commission deserves much of the credit for making repositioning ads possible—at least on television.  
In 1964 the National Broadcasting Company dropped its ban on comparative advertising. But nothing much happened. Commercials are expensive to produce, a few advertisers wanted to produce two versions. One to run on NBC and one to run on the other two networks.  
So in 1972 the FTC prodded the American Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System to allow commercials that named rival brands.  
In 1974 the American Association of Advertising Agencies issued new comparative ad guidelines which represented a complete turnaround from previous policy. Traditionally, the 4A’s had discouraged the use of comparative ads by its member agencies.  
In 1975 the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which controls radio and television in Britain, gave the green light for “knocking” ads in the U.K.  
So repositioning has been “legal” for at least a decade.

## Is repositioning ethical?  
In the past advertising was prepared in isolation. That is, you studied the product and its features, and then you prepared advertising which communicated to your customers and prospects the benefits of those features. It didn’t make much difference whether the competition offered those features or not.  
In the traditional approach, you ignored competition and made every claim seem like a preemptive claim. Mentioning a competitive product, for example, was considered not only bad taste but poor strategy as well.
