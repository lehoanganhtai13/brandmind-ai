Positioning can affect the promotion of the product. Little Caesars became a powerful pizza brand by elevating its “two for the price of one” promotion into a positioning strategy. Their “pizza, pizza” refrain became one of the most memorable advertising programs ever run and made the Little Caesars brand into the fastest-growing pizza chain.  
Then, of course, Little Caesars dropped their “two-for-one” strategy and sales fell apart, an event that demonstrates not only the power of positioning, but also the difficulty of changing one’s position after it is established.  
Marketing is not a static discipline. Marketing is a constantly changing discipline and positioning is one of those revolutionary changes that keeps the marketing field alive, interesting, exciting, and fascinating.  
When you read this seminal book on the subject I think you will find that positioning is not only alive and well today, but also a powerful tool for creating and maintaining real differentiation in the marketplace.
