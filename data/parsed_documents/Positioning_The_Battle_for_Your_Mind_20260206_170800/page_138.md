This data presents a comparative analysis of two categories of cities, "High-speed letter cities" and "Low-cost Telegram cities," each associated with a percentage increase. The "High-speed letter cities" are linked to a "plus 73%" increase, while "Low-cost Telegram cities" are associated with a "plus 100%" increase. The structure is comparative, highlighting a greater percentage increase for "Low-cost Telegram cities" relative to "High-speed letter cities." The core components are the two city categories and their respective percentage gains, illustrating a difference in growth or impact between them.

These numbers alone were enough to prove the superiority of the “low-cost Telegram” position. But what really decided the issue were the product awareness levels in the test cities, which were measured both before the program ran and afterward.

Here are the figures on how many people could correctly describe what a Mailgram was before the print and broadcast advertising began.

This data presents a comparative analysis of two types of urban centers based on their communication infrastructure and associated costs. "High-speed letter cities" represent 27% of the analyzed urban areas, indicating a significant portion of cities with advanced, likely digital, communication capabilities. In contrast, "Low-cost Telegram cities" constitute 23%, suggesting a segment of cities that rely on or are characterized by more traditional, potentially less expensive, communication methods. The structure is a simple comparison of two distinct categories of cities, highlighting their relative prevalence within an unspecified dataset.

Statistically, not much difference. This indicates that the test market cities were pretty evenly matched. In other words, about one-fourth of the market already knew about the Mailgram service.

After the advertising ran, however, there was a big difference in the two groups of cities. Here are the Mailgram awareness levels 13 weeks later.

This data presents a comparative analysis of two categories of cities based on their associated costs. "High-speed letter cities" represent 25% of the total, indicating a segment with a higher associated cost for letter delivery. Conversely, "Low-cost Telegram cities" constitute a larger portion at 47%, suggesting a segment where telegram delivery is more economically viable. The remaining 28% (100% - 25% - 47%) is not explicitly defined but is implied to represent other categories or a baseline. The structure is comparative, highlighting the differing cost profiles and market penetration of these two distinct communication service types within urban environments.

As unbelievable as it may seem, awareness in the high-speed letter cities actually declined. From 27 percent to 25 percent. (Not really statistically significant.)

Then where did the increased volume come from in the high-speed letter cities? Obviously from people who knew what a Mailgram was and were reminded to use the service by the advertising.

It was a totally different story in the low-cost Telegram cities. Mailgram awareness more than doubled. From 23 percent to 47 percent.

Not only was this a big jump, but the numbers suggest that Mailgram volume increases were likely to continue over a long period of time.
