As you might expect, Bayer’s total share of the analgesic market keeps falling.

## What’s a Protein 21?  
Perhaps the classic example of the line-extension trap is what happened to Protein 21 shampoo.  
A number of years ago the Mennen company introduced a combination shampoo/conditioner called Protein 21, which rapidly carved out a 13 percent share of the shampoo market.  
Then Mennen hit the line-extension lure. In rapid succession, the company introduced Protein 21 hairspray in regular and extra hold, scented and unscented. Also Protein 21 conditioner (in two formulas) and Protein 21 concentrate. And to make sure you can’t remember what to put on your hair, Mennen also markets Protein 29. For men.  
No wonder Protein 21’s share of the shampoo market has fallen from 13 percent to 2 percent. And the decline is bound to continue.  
But as incredible as it may seem, line extensions continue to sweep the packaged goods field.

## What’s a Scott?  
Take the position of Scott in paper products. Scott has the lion’s share of the billion-dollar market for towels, napkins, toilet tissues, and other consumer paper products. But Scott was weak where they thought they were strong.  
ScotTowels, ScotTissue, Scotties, Scotkins, even BabyScott diapers. All of these names undermine the Scott foundation. The more products hung on the Scott name, the less meaning the name has to the average consumer.  
Take ScotTissue, for example. ScotTissue was the No. 1 brand in the toilet-tissue market. Then Mr. Whipple and his tissue squeezers at Procter & Gamble moved in. Now ScotTissue is second to Charmin.  
In Scott’s case, a large share of market didn’t mean they owned the position. More important is a large share of mind. The consumer could write “Charmin, Kleenex, Bounty, and Pampers” on a shopping list and we’d know exactly what products he or she was going to get. “Scott” on a shopping list has no meaning.
