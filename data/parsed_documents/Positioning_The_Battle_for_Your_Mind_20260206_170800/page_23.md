Automobile model names, right? Would you be surprised to learn that these are all Chevrolet models?  
Chevrolet is one of the most heavily advertised products in the world. In a recent year, General Motors spent more than $178 million to promote Chevrolet in the United States. That’s $487,000 a day, $20,000 an hour.  
What do you know about Chevrolet? About Chevrolet engines, transmissions, tires? About the seats, upholstery, steering?  
Be honest. How many Chevrolet models are you familiar with? And do you know the differences between them? Confusing, isn’t it?  
The only answer to the problems of an overcommunicated society is the positioning answer. To cut through the traffic jam in the prospect’s mind, you must use Madison Avenue techniques.  
Nearly half the jobs in the United States can be classified as information occupations. More and more people are trying to cope with the problems of our overcommunicated society.  
Whether you have an information job or not, you can benefit from learning the lessons of Madison Avenue. At home and in the office.  

## The media explosion  
Another reason our messages keep getting lost is the number of media we have invented to serve our communication needs.  
* There is television. Commercial, cable, and pay.  
* There’s radio. AM and FM.  
* There’s outdoor. Posters and billboards.  
* There are newspapers. Morning, evening, daily, weekly, and Sunday.  
* There are magazines. Mass magazines, class magazines, enthusiast magazines, business magazines, trade magazines.  
* And, of course, buses, trucks, streetcars, subways, and taxicabs. Generally speaking, anything that moves today is carrying a “message from our sponsor.”  
Even the human body has become a walking billboard for Adidas, Gucci, Benetton, and Gloria Vanderbilt.  
Take advertising again. Just after World War II, the percapita consumption of advertising in the United States was about $25 a year.
