# Positioning of a leader

Companies like Avis and Seven-Up found viable alternative positions to marketing leaders.  
But most companies don’t want to be an also-ran, successful or not. They want to be a leader like Hertz or Coke.  
So how do you get to be the leader? Actually it’s quite simple. Remember Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong?  
You just get there firstest with the mostest.

## Establishing leadership

History shows that the first brand into the brain, on the average, gets twice the long-term market share of the No. 2 brand and twice again as much as the No. 3 brand. And the relationships are not easily changed.  
The leader brand in category after category outsells the number two brand by a wide margin. Hertz outsells Avis, General Motors outsells Ford, Goodyear outsells Firestone, McDonald’s outsells Burger King, General Electric outsells Westinghouse.  
Many marketing experts overlook the enormous advantages of being first. Too often they attribute successes like Kodak and IBM and Coke to “marketing acumen.”

## The failures of leaders

Yet when the shoe is on the other foot, when a marketing leader isn’t first in a new category, the new product is usually an also-ran.  
Coca-Cola is a gigantic company compared with Dr. Pepper. Yet when Coke introduced a competitive product, Mr. Pibb, even the immense resources of the Atlanta giant couldn’t put much of a dent in Dr. Pepper’s sales. Mr. Pibb remains a poor second.  
IBM is a much bigger company than Xerox and has awesome resources of technology, work force, and money. Yet what happened when IBM introduced a line of copiers competitive with those of Xerox?
