True, but customers call the product Intensive Care, not Vaseline. In the mind of the prospect Vaseline is petroleum jelly; Intensive Care is a hand lotion.

## Reverse line extension
While line extension is usually a mistake, the reverse can work. Reverse line extension is called “broadening the base.” One of the best examples is Johnson’s baby shampoo.

By promoting the mildness of the product to the adult market, the company has made Johnson’s baby shampoo one of the leading brands of adult shampoo.

Notice the characteristics of this broadening-the-base strategy. Same product, same package, same label. Only the application has changed.

If Johnson & Johnson had line-extended the product and introduced Johnson’s adult shampoo, the product would not have been nearly as successful.

Another example of broadening the base is Blue Nun, a white wine being promoted as equally good with meat courses as with fish.

But aren’t these examples of the “everybody trap”? Not exactly. Johnson’s baby shampoo is the first and only baby shampoo being promoted as an adult product too. And Blue Nun is the only white wine being advertised as good with meat as well as fish.

If other brands tried the same approach, they wouldn’t be nearly as successful as these two.

And then there is Arm & Hammar baking soda, being promoted as good for refrigerators and drains. Very successfully too. But what happened when the same company line-extended with Arm & Hammer, the baking soda deodorant?

Very little. As Phyllis Diller says, “It only works if you’re standing in the refrigerator.” Line extension is popular.
