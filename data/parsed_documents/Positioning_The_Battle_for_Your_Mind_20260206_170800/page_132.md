# Positioning a product: Milk Duds

The brand is Milk Duds, a product of Switzer Clark. Milk Duds is a candy product that comes in a little yellow and brown box. It had a reputation as a “movie” candy for teenagers, but the company wanted to broaden its Milk Duds business to include the younger crowd.

## Looking into the mind

The first step in any positioning program is to look inside the mind of the prospect.  
And who is the prospect for Milk Duds? It’s not some little kid who doesn’t know the score. Research indicates that the best Milk Duds prospect is a sophisticated candy buyer. He or she has been in and out of candy stores several hundred times at least.  
The average Milk Duds prospect is 10 years old. A cautious, suspicious, shrewd purchasing agent who is always on the lookout for value received.  
Most positioning programs are nothing more or less than a search for the obvious. Yet the obvious is easy to miss if you zero in too quickly on the product itself. (As with the “purloined letter” of Edgar Allan Poe, the obvious is often hard to find because it’s too easy to see. It’s too obvious.)  
What’s in the prospect’s mind when the subject of candy comes up? Not Milk Duds, even though the average 10-year-old kid might be vaguely aware of the brand.  
For most 10-year-olds, the candy urge immediately conjures up the concept of candy bars.  
Candy bars like Hersheys, Nestlés, Mounds, Almond Joys, Reeses, Snickers, Milky Ways. Put there, of course, by the millions of dollars’ worth of advertising spent on these and other candy bar brands.

## Repositioning the competition

Since Milk Duds was getting only a small fraction of that kind of advertising money, it would have been hopeless to try to build a separate identity for the brand.
