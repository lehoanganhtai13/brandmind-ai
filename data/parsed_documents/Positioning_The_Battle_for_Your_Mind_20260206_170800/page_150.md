4. **Speedy lock box service.** United Jersey people pick up checks six times a day during the workweek, four times on the weekend. Its Newark lock box has its own private ZIP Code. United Jersey empties lock boxes and fills up customer accounts as fast as it can.

5. **FACT terminals.** (Fast Authorization of Cashless Transactions.) With these terminals now in place, merchants enjoy the benefit of rapid electronic approvals. And faster approvals with minimized risk mean improved cash flow.

6. **Responsiveness.** Whether it’s being first with a new product or matching the competition’s rates, United Jersey is committed to being responsive to the customer’s financial needs.

7. **Central location.** United Jersey built its new corporate headquarters in Princeton. From the geographic center of the state, United Jersey is less than an hour away from any of its business customers by car, even less by helicopter.

## Advertising the fast-moving bank

When the bank’s performance matched the promises the advertising was going to make, the advertising started to make the promises. Focusing on the weakness of the competition, naturally.

Each television spot contrasted United Jersey bankers with their counterparts at the whimsically named “Lethargic National Bank.” In one spot, approval for a business loan at Lethargic National seemed to take forever. A second spot showed a Lethargic banker disappearing when a customer needed a quick answer to his questions. And in the third spot, a husband and wife found the bankers at Lethargic moving in slow motion on a simple installment loan.

The humorous vignettes drove home the point that United Jersey “values your time as much as your money.”

Print advertisements also carried the “fast-moving bank” theme. “Haste makes money” and “Banks shouldn’t hold up people,” were two typical headlines.

“Time Is Money” desk signs were given to all United Jersey bank officers, a not-so-subtle reminder not to keep the customer sitting next to their desk waiting.
