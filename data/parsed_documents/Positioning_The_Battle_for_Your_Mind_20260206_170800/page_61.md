# Repositioning the competition

There comes a time when you can’t find a creneau. With hundreds of variations in each product category on the market, the chances of finding an open hole today are very slim.

For example, take your average supermarket, with 12,000 different products or brands on display. That means a young person has to sort out and catalog 12,000 different names in his or her head.

When you consider that the average college graduate has a speaking vocabulary of only 8000 words, you can see the problem.

The kid spends 4 years in a university and ends up 4000 words down.

## Creating your own creneau

With a plethora of products in every category, how does a company use advertising to blast its way into the mind? The basic underlying marketing strategy has got to be “reposition the competition.”

Because there are so few creneaus to fill, a company must create one by repositioning the competitors that occupy the positions in the mind.

In other words, to move a new idea or product into the mind, you must first move an old one out.

> “The world is round,” said Christopher Columbus. “No, it’s not,” said the public, “it’s flat.”

To convince the public otherwise, fifteenth century scientists first had to prove that the world wasn’t flat. One of their more convincing arguments was the fact that sailors at sea were first able to observe the tops of the masts of an approaching ship, then the sails, then the hull. If the world were flat, they would see the whole ship at once.

All the mathematical arguments in the world weren’t as effective as a simple observation the public could verify themselves.

Once an old idea is overturned, selling the new idea is often ludicrously simple. As a matter of fact, people will often actively search for a new idea to fill the void.
