Another typically American attitude makes positioning thinking difficult. Ever since childhood, we have been taught to think in a certain way.

“The power of positive thinking,” Norman Vincent Peale called it. An attitude which may sell a lot of books but which can destroy a person’s ability to find a creneau.

To find a creneau, you must have the ability to think in reverse, to go against the grain. If everyone else is going east, see if you can find your creneau by going west. A strategy that worked for Christopher Columbus can also work for you.

Let’s explore some strategies for finding creneaus.

### The size creneau

For years, Detroit automakers were on a longer, lower kick. Each model year, cars became more streamlined, better looking.

Enter the Volkswagen Beetle. Short, fat, and ugly.

The conventional way to promote the Beetle would have been to minimize the weaknesses and maximize the strengths.

“Let’s get a fashion photographer who can make the car look better than it is. Then we’ll play up the reliability angle,” is your ordinary strategy.

But the creneau was size. The most effective ad Volkswagen ever ran was the one which stated the position clearly and unequivocally.

“Think small.”

With two simple words, this headline did two things at once. It stated the Volkswagen position, and it challenged the prospect’s assumption that bigger is necessarily better.

The effectiveness of this approach, of course, depends on the existence of an open creneau in the prospect’s mind. Not that there weren’t other small cars on the market at the time the Beetle was introduced. There were, but no one else had preempted the small-car position.

Integrated circuits and other electronic devices make the “small-size” creneau technically feasible in many product categories. Only time will tell which companies will be able to capitalize on electronics to build valuable positions based on miniaturization.

The opposite presents opportunities too. There are opportunities to build positions in projection television sets and other products based on large The classic example is Michelob.
