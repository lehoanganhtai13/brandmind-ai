Pan A-mer-i-can Air-lines (seven syllables) has a phonetically long name. So they shortened it to Pan Am, two syllables. Much better than the initials PAA, which would be difficult to remember.  
Trans World Air-lines (four syllables) is actually phonetically shorter than the T-Dou-ble-U-A they are using, But isn’t TWA well known? Yes, it is, thanks to $70 million worth of advertising a year.  
Although TWA spends about as much on advertising as its larger American and United competitors, surveys show that TWA has half the passenger preference of the other two. The inefficiency of the initials TWA is one reason.  
What name should Trans World Airlines use?  
“Trans World,” of course. Only two syllables long, Trans World is short and graphic.

## Acronyms and phone directories  
Some companies are lucky. Their initials, either by design or by accident, form acronyms. For example: Fiat (Federation Internationale Automobiles Torino) and Sabena (*Société Anonyme Belge d’Exploitation de la Navigation Aèrienne*).  
Often organizations will select carefully names that form meaningful acronyms. Two examples: CARE (Committee for Aid and Rehabilitation in Europe) and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers).  
Other companies aren’t so lucky. When General Aniline & Film changed its name to GAF, it chose to overlook the fact that the acronym sounds like “clumsy error.” GAF is a gaffe in more ways than one.  
The other thing people tend to forget when they pick a name is the problem of finding it in the telephone directory. Since you seldom look up your own name in a phone book, you might not realize how hard it is to locate.  
Take MCI, for example. In the Manhattan telephone directory, you might expect to find MCI somewhere between McHugh and McKensie. But of course, it’s not there. MCI Telecommunications is 48 pages away where it has to compete with seven other companies that incorporate MCI in their names. (Following standard rules of alphabetizing a list of names, the phone company puts all initial names up front.) Take USM Corporation, for example.
