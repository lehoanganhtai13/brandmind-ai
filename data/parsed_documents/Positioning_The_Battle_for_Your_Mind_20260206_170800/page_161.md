As young executives, they notice that top managers usually use initials:  
J. S. Smith, R. H. Jones. So they do the same. On memos and in letters.  
It’s a mistake. You can afford to do that only if everyone knows who you are. If you’re on your way up, if you’re trying to burn your name into the minds of top management, you need a name, not a set of initials. For exactly the same reasons your company does.  
Write your name and look at it. Roger P. Dinkelacker.  
What a name like this says psychologically to management is: We are such a big company and you have such an insignificant job that you must use the “P” to differentiate yourself from the other Roger Dinkelackers on the staff.  
Not likely.  
It is possible, if your name is something like John Smith or Mary Jones, that you actually do need a middle initial to differentiate yourself from the other John Smiths or Mary Joneses.  
If so, what you really need is a new name. Confusion is the enemy of successful positioning. You can’t “burn in” a name that’s too common. How are other people going to differentiate between John T. Smith and John S. Smith?  
They won’t bother. They’ll just forget you along with the rest. And the no-name trap will have claimed another victim.

**Avoid the line-extension trap**  
If you had three daughters, would you name them Mary 1, Mary 2, and Mary 3? As a matter of fact, would you name them Mary, Marian, and Marilyn? Either way, you’re creating a lifetime of confusion.  
When you hang a junior on your son’s name, you do him no favor. He deserves a separate identity.  
In show business, where you must burn a clearcut identity in the mind of the public, even a famous last name should probably not be used.  
Today Liza Minnelli is a bigger star than her mother, Judy Garland, ever was. As Liza Garland, she would have started with a handicap.  
Frank Sinatra, Jr., is an example of the most difficult kind of line-extension name. He literally started with two strikes against him.  
With a name like Frank Sinatra, Jr., the audience says to itself, “He’s not going to be able to sing as well as his father.” Since you hear what you expect to hear, of course he doesn’t.
