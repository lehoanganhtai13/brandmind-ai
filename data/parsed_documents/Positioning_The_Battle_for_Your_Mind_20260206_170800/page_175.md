In a sense, every product or service is “packaged goods.” If it isn’t sold in a box, the name becomes the box.

## You must know how words affect people  
Words are triggers. They trigger the meanings which are buried in the mind.  
Of course, if people understood this, there would be no advantage in renaming a product or selecting emotional words like Mustang for an automobile.  
But they don’t. Most people are “unsane.” They’re not completely sane and they’re not completely insane. They’re somewhere in between.  
What’s the difference between sane people and insane people? What exactly do insane people do? Alfred Korzybski, who developed the concept of general semantics, explains that insane people try to make the world of reality fit what is in their heads.  
The insane person who thinks he is Napoleon makes the outside world fit that notion.  
The sane person constantly analyzes the world of reality and then changes what’s inside his or her head to fit the facts.  
That’s an awful lot of trouble for most people. Besides, how many people want to constantly change their opinions to fit the facts?  
It’s a whole lot easier to change the facts to fit your opinions.  
Unsane people make up their minds and then find the facts to “verify” their opinion. Or even more commonly, they accept the opinion of the nearest “expert,” and then they don’t have to bother with the facts at all.  
So you see the power of the psychologically right name. The mind makes the world of reality fit the name. A Mustang looks sportier, racier, and faster than if the same car had been called the Turtle.  
Language is the currency of the mind. To think conceptually, you manipulate words. With the right choice of words, you can influence the thinking process itself. (As proof that the mind “thinks with words” and not abstract thoughts, consider how a language is learned. To be really fluent in a foreign language, say French, you must learn to think in French.)  
But there are limits. If a word is so far out of touch with reality, the mind just refuses to use the word. It says “large” on the tube that everyone except the manufacturer calls a “small” toothpaste tube.
