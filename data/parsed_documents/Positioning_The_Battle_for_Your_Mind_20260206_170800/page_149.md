How do you find weakness in Citibank, which has almost as many vice presidents as United Jersey has employees?

## The disadvantage of large size

The problem of finding a meaningful advantage for United Jersey can be approached by looking at the disadvantages of its big-city competitors.

Why position United Jersey against the big banks? Why not take on the score of small financial institutions? The reason to go against the big banks is because they are the ones in the minds of the prospects. Positioning is always a question of dealing with what’s in the mind.

The disadvantage of large size is slow service. As an Avis ad once said, “Rent from us. The line at our counter is shorter.” Banks shouldn’t hold up people, either. We developed a positioning strategy for United Jersey called the “fast-moving bank.” This strategy had two key aspects.

**A.** Exploit the only real weakness of the big metropolitan New York banks: their slow reaction time.

**B.** Encourage United Jersey management to make sure the bank’s performance matches the advertising’s promise. That took the form of seven key commitments.

1. **Decentralized decisions.** United Jersey pushed decision making down to the local level. (One of their lending teams can approve a $10 million loan, and that team meets daily.) In 10 commercial banking centers throughout the state, other officers on site can make business loans quickly.

2. **Cross training.** United Jersey trains its people in all their banking services, not just in one specialty. So when a customer has a question, he or she doesn’t have to wait for an answer while the question is referred to another person.

3. **Commitment to electronics.** United Jersey’s system of statewide ATMs (Automatic Teller Machines) is the largest private network in the state. United Jersey’s corporate customers can be on line directly with the bank’s computers for balance inquiries and other daily questions.
