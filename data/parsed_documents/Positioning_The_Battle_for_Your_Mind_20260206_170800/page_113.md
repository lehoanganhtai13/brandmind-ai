Line extension can work if….
But it’s a big if. If your competitors are foolish. If your volume is small.  
If you have no competitors. If you don’t expect to build a position in the  
prospect’s mind. If you don’t do any advertising.  
The truth is, many products are sold, few are positioned.  
That is, the customer will pick up a can of peas without having a going-in preference, or position, for a brand of peas. In this case, any well-known brand name is going to do better than any unknown name.  
And if you work for a company with thousands of small-volume products (3M is a typical example), you obviously cannot have a new name for every one.  
So we offer some rules of the road that will tell you when to use the house name and when not to.

1. **Expected volume.** Potential winners should not bear the house name. Small-volume products should.  
2. **Competition.** In a vacuum, the brand should not bear the house name. In a crowded field, it should.  
3. **Advertising support.** Big-budget brands should not bear the house name. Small-budget brands should.  
4. **Significance.** Breakthrough products should not bear the house name. Commodity products such as chemicals should.  
5. **Distribution.** Off-the-shelf items should not bear the house name. Items sold by sales reps should.
