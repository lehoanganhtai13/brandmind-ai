In the consumer field, there is the laser videodisk player. The laser audiodisk player. And the laser everything disk which can play both video and audio.  
No self-respecting rock show would end without a laser light show. Even Ronald Reagan’s “star wars” satellites would be equipped with nuclear-powered laser weapons.

**The fourth technology**  
In the past 30 years, three technologies have roared through the office and into the dictionary. The first was *thermography* by 3M, a photocopying process that uses infrared rays to produce a copy on a special type of paper.  
The second was *xerography* by Xerox, a copying process that uses the action of light to produce a copy on plain paper.  
The third is the *microprocessor* technology that computer companies like IBM have dominated.  
There’s an opportunity for Xerox to put another technological word in a yet to be published edition of Webster’s Dictionary.  
The fourth technology would be called “lasography.” It could be defined as the process of communicating, printing, scanning, and storing optical or printed messages with the use of laser beams and optical fibers.

**One word can say a lot**  
Xerox is a $9 billion company with more than 100,000 employees. It ought to be impossible to position an enterprise as big and diverse as Xerox with a single word.  
But in an overcommunicated society there is only so much room in the mind. Today Xerox means just one word—copiers. Tomorrow Xerox could use lasography to create a broader mental position.  
Lasography says new and different, and the business world loves things that are new and different.  
Lasography sounds like a basic technology somehow related to xerography. In other words, it connects with Xerox’s last big technology.  
Lasography from Xerox, the company that’s perceived to be in the “ography” business.
