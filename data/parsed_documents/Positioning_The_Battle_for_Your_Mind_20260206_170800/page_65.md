Go back to square one and start all over again. With a new product and a new game.  
Of all companies, Procter & Gamble should have known the power of repositioning. And should have taken steps in advance to protect Pringle’s.

## Repositioning Listerine  
One of P & G’s most powerful programs is the one for Scope mouthwash. P & G used two words to reposition Listerine, the King of Halitosis Hill.  
“Medicine breath.”  
These two words were enough to torpedo Listerine’s highly successful “the taste you hate, twice a day” theme.  
The Scope attack carved a few share points out of market leader Listerine and firmly established Scope in second place.  
The Listerine/Scope battle caused the usual casualties. Micrin and Binaca folded. Lavoris saw its market share wither away.  
But let’s face it. Scope has not become the market success it should be, based on theory.  
Why? Look at the name again.  
Scope? It sounds like a board game from Parker Brothers. Not like a good-tasting mouthwash that will make you a big hit with the opposite sex. If Scope had been given a name like Close-Up toothpaste, it could have parlayed its brilliant repositioning strategy with sales success to match.

## Repositioning vs. comparative ads  
The success of the Tylenol, Scope, Royal Doulton, and other repositioning programs has spawned a host of similar advertising. Too often, however, these copycat campaigns have missed the essence of repositioning strategy.  
“We’re better than our competitors” isn’t repositioning. It’s comparative advertising and not very effective. There’s a psychological flaw in the advertiser’s reasoning which the prospect is quick to detect. “If your brand is so good, how come it’s not the leader?”  
A look at comparative ads suggests why most of them aren’t effective. They fail to reposition the competition.  
Rather, they use the competitor as a benchmark for their own brand. Then they tell the reader or viewer how much better they are. Which, of course, is exactly what the prospect expects the advertiser to say.
