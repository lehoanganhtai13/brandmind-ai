Simple concepts expressed with simple words used in a straightforward way.  
Often the solution to a problem is so simple that thousands of people have looked at it without seeing it. When an idea is clever or complicated, however, we should be suspicious. It probably won’t work because it’s not simple enough.  
The history of science is a history of the Ketterings of this world who found simple solutions to complex problems.  
The head of an advertising agency once insisted that his account executives paste down the marketing strategy on the back of each layout.  
Then when the client asked what the ad was supposed to do, the account person could turn the layout over and read the strategy.  
But an ad should be simple enough so that it is the strategy.  
The agency made a mistake. It ran the wrong side of the layout.  

### You need subtlety  
Beginners who play the positioning game often remark, “How easy this is. You just find a position you can call your own.”  
Simple, yes. But easy, no.  
The difficulty is finding an open position that’s also effective. In politics, for example, it’s easy to establish a position to the far right (a conservative position) or the far left (a socialist position). You will undoubtedly preempt either position.  
You will also lose.  
What you must do is to find an opening near the center of the spectrum. You must be slightly conservative in a field of liberals or slightly liberal in a field of conservatives.  
This calls for great restraint and subtlety. The big winners in business and in life are those people who have found open positions near the center of the spectrum. Not at the edge.  
You can sometimes have a positioning success and a sales failure. This might be termed “Rolls-Royce thinking.”  
“We’re the Rolls-Royce of the industry” is a claim you often hear in business today.  
Do you know how many Rolls-Royces are sold in America every year?
