When virtually all advertising was in newspapers and magazines, *Printer’s Ink* was a good name for a magazine directed to the advertising field. But today radio and television are just as important as print. So *Printer’s Ink* is dead and *Advertising Age* reigns supreme.  
One of the strongest publications in the world today is *The Wall Street Journal*. It has no real competitors. But *The Wall Street Journal* is a weak name for a daily business newspaper. The name implies a narrow, financial orientation. But the publication covers business generally.  
Of such observations are opportunities fashioned.  
Engineers and scientists in love with their own creations are responsible for some of the really bad names. Names like XD-12, for example. (Presumably standing for “experimental design number 12.”) These are inside jokes that have no meaning in the mind of the prospect.  
Take Mennen E, for example. People are literal and they take things literally. Mennen E deodorant was doomed to failure in spite of a $10 million advertising launch. The trouble was the name on the can. The introductory ad even admitted that the idea was a little unusual. “Vitamin E, incredibly, is a deodorant.”  
It is incredible. That is, unless they were appealing to people who want the strongest, best-fed, healthiest armpits in the country. Mennen E didn’t last very long.  
And what about Breck One and Colgate 100? Brand names like these are meaningless.  
With marginal differences in many product categories, a better name can mean millions of dollars difference in sales.  

## When to use a coined name  
What about the obvious success of companies with coined names like Coca-Cola, Kodak, and Xerox?  
One of the things that makes positioning thinking difficult for many people is the failure to understand the role of timing.  
The first company into the mind with a new product or new idea is going to become famous. Whether the name is Lindbergh or Smith or Rumplestiltskin.
