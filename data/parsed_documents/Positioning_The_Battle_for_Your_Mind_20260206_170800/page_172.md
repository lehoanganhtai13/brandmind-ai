Do your advertisements for yourself match your position? Do your clothes, for example, tell the world that you’re a banker or a lawyer or an artist?  
Or do you wear creative clothes that undermine your position?  
Creativity by itself is worthless. Only when it is subordinated to the positioning objective can creativity make a contribution.

**The role of the outsider**  
The question sometimes arises: Do we do it ourselves or do we hire someone to position us?  
The someone that often gets hired is an advertising agency. An ad agency? Who needs help from those Madison Avenue hucksters?  
Everybody. But only the rich can afford to hire an advertising agency. All the others have to learn how to do it themselves. Have to learn how to apply the invaluable ingredient only available from the outsider.  
And what does the outsider supply? An ingredient called ignorance. In other words, objectivity.  
By not knowing what goes on inside a company, the outsider is better able to see what is happening on the outside. In the mind of the prospect.  
The outsider is naturally attuned to outside-in thinking, while the insider is more comfortable with inside-out thinking.  
Objectivity is the key ingredient supplied by the advertising or marketing communication or public relations agency.

**What the outsider doesn’t supply**  
In a word, magic. Some business managers believe that the role of an advertising agency is to wave a magic wand which causes prospects to immediately rush out and buy the product.  
The wand, of course, is called “creativity,” a commodity much sought after by the neophyte advertiser.  
The popular view is that the agency “creates.” And that the best agencies are filled with a substance called “creativity” which they liberally apply to their advertising solutions.  
In advertising circles, the story is told about an advertising agency that was very creative. So creative, in fact, it could take straw and spin it into Now you might have heard of them because they had a very creative name.
