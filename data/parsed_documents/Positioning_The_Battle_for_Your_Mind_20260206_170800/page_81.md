Dou-ble-U U. West-ern Un-ion. (Except for W, every other English language letter is just one syllable.)

While customers refer to companies phonetically, the companies they talk about have a different way of looking at themselves. Companies are visually oriented. They go to a lot of trouble making sure the names look right without considering how it sounds.

## Visual shorthand

Business people also fall into the same trap. The first thing to go is the given name. When young Edmund Gerald Brown starts up the executive ladder at General Manufacturing Corporation, he instantly becomes E. G. Brown from GMC on internal letters and memos.

But to be well known, you’ve got to avoid using initials—a fact known by most politicians. Which is why E. M. Kennedy and J. E. Carter bill themselves as Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter.

As a matter of fact, the new wave of politicians don’t use either middle names or initials. Jack Kemp, Gary Hart, Bill Bradley, George Bush, Ronald Reagan.

What about FDR and JFK? The irony of the situation is that once you get to the top, once you are well known, then initials can be used without ambiguity. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John Fitzgerald Kennedy could use initials only after they became famous. Not before.

The next thing to go is the name of the company. What starts out as visual shorthand to conserve paper and typing time ends up as the monogram of success.

IBM, AT&T, GE, 3M. Sometimes it seems that membership in the Fortune 500 depends upon having a readily recognized set of initials. The moniker that tells the world you have made it.

So today, we have such monikers as AM International, AMAX, AMF, AMP, BOC, CBI Industries, CF Industries, CPC International, EG&G, FMC, GAF, IC Industries, ITT, LTV, MEI, NCR, NL Industries, NVF, PPG Industries, SCM, TRW, and VF.

These are not two-bit companies. All are currently on *Fortune’s* list of the 500 largest industrial companies. The smallest company on the list, AM International, had sales of $598 million in a recent year and more than 10,000 employees.
