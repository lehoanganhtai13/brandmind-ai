# Positioning a ski resort: Stowe

There are over a thousand “name” ski areas in America. Since the mind of the average skier can hold only a fraction of those names, the problem of positioning a ski resort can be difficult.

If your name is Stowe, the problem is greatly simplified. Stowe is already well known. “Stowe is for me the essential Eastern ski village,” said *Advertising Age* columnist James Brady, “the way Aspen is out west or Val d’Isere is in France or Kitzbühel is in Austria.”

## Why a position for Stowe?

With that kind of reputation, why does Stowe need a position? Isn’t it enough to advertise Stowe and let the skier conjure up the Stowe image?

To a certain extent, this is true. The reputation of a product like Steinway or a place like Stowe creates word of mouth which carries the reputation along from year to year. But proper positioning can enhance the word of mouth and contribute to the process. In essence, the positioning supplies the material to talk about.

What do skiers talk about? James Brady put it best. They talk about places to ski, places like Aspen, Val d’Isere, and Kitzbühel.

With this background in mind, the search began for a position for Stowe. The situation seemed to call for the outside expert, the person who could supply the credibility to bring a comparison claim to life.

## The top 10 ski resorts in the world

The noted ski and travel writer, Abby Rand, supplied the credibility. Writing in *Harper’s Bazaar*, she selected the top 10 ski resorts in the world. One was Stowe, Vermont. The others were: Aspen, Colorado; Courchevel, France; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Kitzbühel, Austria; Portillo, Chile; St. Christoph, Austria; St. Moritz, Switzerland; Sun Valley, Idaho; and Vail, Colorado. (Not a bad list.) The positioning advertisements for Stowe used shoulder patches to illustrate the ski areas.
