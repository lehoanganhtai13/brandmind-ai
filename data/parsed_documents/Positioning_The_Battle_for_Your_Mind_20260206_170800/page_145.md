A second ad had a photo of palm trees in front of a building with a Citibank N.A. sign.

To a big city bank, a branch in Nassau isn’t necessarily your Nassau.  
Chances are it will turn out to be in the Bahamas. It’s one of the favorite locations of the big city banks. In fact, the multinational institutions have some $75 billion in loans booked in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands.  
Nothing wrong with that. Except it doesn’t do much for you if Long Island is your home.  
Long Island is not only our favorite location, it’s our only location. We have 18 branches in Nassau (County, that is) and 16 in Queens and Suffolk.  
And we’ve been here a long time, over a half century. We’re involved financially to the extent that 95 percent of our loans and services go to Long Islanders and their homes, schools, and businesses.  
Other ads in the campaign had similar themes:  
“The city is a great place to visit, but would you want to bank there?”  
“To a city bank, the only island that really counts is Manhattan.” (A tiny drawing of Long Island is dwarfed by an enormous drawing of Manhattan.)  
“If times get tough, will the city banks get going? (Back to the city.)”  
Fifteen months later the same research was repeated. Notice how Long Island Trust’s position improved in every attribute.

Many branches

This data presents a comparative analysis of six banks, ranked by a numerical "Score." Long Island Trust leads with a score of 7.0, followed closely by National Bank of North America at 6.8. Chemical Bank scores 6.6, and Citibank is at 6.5. Chase Manhattan and European American banks share the lowest score of 6.1, indicating a comparative ranking of their performance or standing based on the provided metric. The structure is a simple, ordered list, highlighting differences in scores among these financial institutions. From last to first place in “many branches.” In spite of the fact that Chemical Bank, for example, has more than twice as many branches on Long Island.
