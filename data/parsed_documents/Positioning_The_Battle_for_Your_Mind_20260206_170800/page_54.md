# Positioning of a follower

What works for a leader doesn’t necessarily work for a follower. Leaders can often cover a competitive move and retain their leadership.

But followers are not in the same position to benefit from a covering strategy. When a follower copies a leader, it’s not covering at all. It’s better described as a me-too response. (Usually phrased more diplomatically as “keeping in tune with the times.”)

## Why products fail

Most products fail to achieve reasonable sales goals because the accent is on “better” rather than “speed.” That is, the No. 2 company thinks the road to success is to introduce a me-too product, only better.

It’s not enough to be better than the competitor. You must introduce your product before someone else has a chance to establish leadership. With a more massive advertising and promotion launch. And a better name. (More on this point later.)

Yet the opposite normally occurs. The me-too company wastes valuable time on improving the product. Then the launch is made with a smaller advertising budget than the leader’s. And then the new product is given the house name, because that’s the easy way to ensure a quick share of market. All deadly traps in our overcommunicated society.

How do you find an open position in the prospect’s mind?

## Cherchez le creneau

The French have a marketing expression that sums up this strategy rather neatly.

* Cherchez le creneau. “Look for the hole.”
* Cherchez le creneau and then fill it.

That advice goes against the “bigger and better” philosophy ingrained into the American spirit.
