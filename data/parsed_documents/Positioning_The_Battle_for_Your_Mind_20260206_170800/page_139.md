Western Union also measured Telegram volume in the test cities before, during, and after the advertising. They found that volume held fairly stable. In fact, the company felt that advertising the Mailgram as the low-cost Telegram helped rather than hurt Telegram volume.

And what has happened to Mailgram since the development of this advertising strategy? The volume numbers tell the story.

This data presents a comparative overview of the volume of something over two distinct, yet sequential, periods. The first period spans from 1972 to 1976, showing an increase in volume from 6 million to 25 million. The second period, from 1977 to 1981, continues this upward trend, with the volume escalating from 28 million to 41 million. The structure is comparative, highlighting the growth trajectory across these two five-year intervals, with a slight overlap in the starting point of the second period (28 million in 1977) compared to the end of the first (25 million in 1976), indicating sustained and accelerating growth.

After 10 years of success, Western Union decided to change the Mailgram strategy. Instead of “impact,” the new strategy would emphasize “next-day delivery.” So they hired a new advertising agency to develop the new program.

Again, the volume numbers tell the story.

This data presents a chronological overview of a specific volume over a four-year period, from 1981 to 1984. The structure is comparative, highlighting changes in volume year-over-year. In 1981, the volume was recorded at 41 million. This figure subsequently decreased each year, reaching 37 million in 1982, then dropping to 30 million in 1983. The trend continued downwards, with the volume recorded at 22 million in 1984, indicating a consistent decline over the observed timeframe.

Rarely can you find such a clearcut example of the difference between good advertising strategy and bad. (Most examples are clouded by other factors.) But in the Mailgram case, the minute the strategy was changed, volume declined.

Your problem is not just one of developing a good strategy. Equally important is the courage you will need to keep hammering at the same theme, year after year.
