**The third horse to ride is a friend.** Many business people have an enormous number of personal friends but no business friends. And while personal friends are awfully nice to have and can sometimes get you a deal on a TV set or braces for the kids, they’re usually not too helpful when it comes to finding a better job.  

Most of the big breaks that happen in a person’s career happen because a business friend recommended that person.  

The more business friends you make outside of your own organization, the more likely you are to wind up in a big, rewarding job.  

It’s not enough just to make friends. You have to take out that friendship horse and exercise it once in a while. If you don’t you won’t be able to ride it when you need it.  

When an old business friend you haven’t heard from in 10 years calls you and wants to have lunch, you know two things will happen: (1) you’re going to pay for the lunch, and (2) your friend is looking for a job.  

When you need a job, it’s usually too late to try that type of tactic. The way to ride the friendship horse is to keep in touch regularly with all your business friends.  

Send them tear sheets of articles they may be interested in, clips of publicity items, and congratulatory letters when they get promoted.  

And don’t assume people always see stories that might have mentioned them. They don’t. And they always appreciate it when someone sends them an item they may have missed.  

**The fourth horse to ride is an idea.** On the night before he died, Victor Hugo wrote in his diary, “Nothing, not all the armies of the world, can stop an idea whose time has come.”  

Everyone knows that an idea can take you to the top faster than anything else. But people sometimes expect too much of an idea. They want one that is not only great, but one that everyone else thinks is great too.  

There are no such ideas. If you wait until an idea is ready to be accepted, it’s too late. Someone else will have preempted it.  

Or in the in-out vocabulary of a few years ago: Anything definitely in is already on its way out.
