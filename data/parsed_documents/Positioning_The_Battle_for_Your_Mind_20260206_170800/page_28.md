Kodak in photography, Kleenex in tissue, Xerox in plainpaper copiers,  
Hertz in rent-a-cars, Coca in cola, General in electric.  
The first thing you need to “fix your message indelibly in the mind” is not a message at all. It’s a mind. An innocent mind. A mind that has not been burnished by someone else’s brand.  
What’s true in business is true in nature too.  
“Imprinting” is the term animal biologists use to describe the first encounter between a newborn animal and its natural mother. It takes only a few seconds to fix indelibly in the memory of the young animal the identity of its parent.  
You might think all ducks look alike, but even a day-old duckling will always recognize its mother, no matter how much you mix up the flock.  
Well, that’s not quite true. If the imprinting process is interrupted by the substitution of a dog or cat or even a human being, the duckling will treat the substitute as its natural mother. No matter how different the creature looks.  
Falling in love is a similar phenomenon. While people are more selective than ducks, they’re not nearly as selective as you might think.  
What counts most is receptivity. Two people must meet in a situation in which both are receptive to the idea. Both must have open windows. That is, neither is deeply in love with someone else.  
Marriage, as a human institution, depends on the concept of first being better than best. And so does business.  
If you want to be successful in love or in business, you must appreciate the importance of getting into the mind first.  
You build brand loyalty in a supermarket the same way you build mate loyalty in a marriage. You get there first and then be careful not to give them a reason to switch.  

### The hard way into the mind  
And what if your name is not Charles or Neil or Kleenex or Hertz? What if someone else got into your prospect’s mind first?  
The hard way to get into a person’s mind is second. Second is nowhere.  
What’s the largest-selling book ever published? (Also the first book ever printed with movable type?) The Bible, of course.
