To buses and jeep-type vehicles.  
Act Three is the denouement. Is it possible that eight models won’t sell as well as one? It’s not only possible, it happened.  
From first place in imported cars, Volkswagen fell to fourth. Behind Toyota, Datson, and Honda. And just barely ahead of Mazda and Subaru.  
The pattern of early success followed by line extension followed by disillusionment is fairly common. After all, you can’t expect companies like Scott and Volkswagen to rest on their laurels. You’d expect them to find new fields to conquer. So how do they go about finding them? One way is obvious. They develop a new concept or a new product with a new position and a new name to match.  

**A name is a rubber band**  
It will stretch, but not beyond a certain point. Furthermore, the more you stretch a name, the weaker it becomes. (Just the opposite of what you might expect.)  
How far should you stretch a name? This is an economics call as much as a judgment call.  
Let’s say you have a line of canned vegetables. Do you have a brand name for peas, another for corn, and still a third for string beans? Probably not. Economically, it wouldn’t make sense.  
So Del Monte is probably right to use the same brand name on its line of canned fruits and vegetables. But notice what happens when a competitor zeroes in on a single product. The Dole line of canned pineapple.  
Dole vs. Del Monte in pineapple is no contest. Dole wins every time.  
So what does Dole do next? It puts the Dole name on fresh bananas. The Dole banana.  
Let’s say Dole is successful in making Dole mean bananas. So what happens to pineapple? It’s the teeter-totter principle with bananas on one side and pineapple on the other.  
But can’t Dole do what Del Monte did? Become a full-line supplier of canned and fresh food products?  
Sure, but only at the expense of sacrificing its valuable pineapple franchise. And with the added disadvantage of being the last to line-extend.  

**Rules of the road** We call line extension a “trap,” not a mistake.
