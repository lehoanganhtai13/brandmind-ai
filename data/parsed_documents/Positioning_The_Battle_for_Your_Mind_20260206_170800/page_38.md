That’s why if you have a truly new product, it’s often better to tell the prospect what the product is not, rather than what it is.  
The first automobile, for example, was called a “horseless” carriage, a name which allowed the public to position the concept against the existing mode of transportation.  
Words like “off-track” betting, “lead-free” gasoline, and “sugar-free” soda are all examples of how new concepts can best be positioned against the old.

## The “against” position  
In today’s marketplace the competitor’s position is just as important as your own. Sometimes more important. An early success in the positioning era was the famous Avis campaign.  
The Avis campaign will go down in marketing history as a classic example of establishing the “against” position. In the case of Avis, this was a position against the leader.  
“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.”  
For 13 years in a row, Avis lost money. Then they admitted that they were No. 2 and Avis started to make money.  
The first year Avis made $1.2 million. The second year, $2.6 million. The third year, $5 million. Then the company was sold to ITT.  
Avis was able to make substantial gains because they recognized the position of Hertz and didn’t try to attack them head-on.  
To better understand why the Avis program was so successful, let’s look into the mind of the prospect and imagine we can see a product ladder marked “rent-a-cars.”  
On each rung of the product ladder is a brand name. Hertz on top. Avis on the second rung. National on the third.  
Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder.  
Not at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to Hertz. (If trying harder were the secret of success, Harold Stassen would have been President many times over.)  
As an indication of how far the advertising business has come in its acceptance of comparative ads, *Time* magazine originally rejected the “We try harder” line as being too competitive with Hertz.
