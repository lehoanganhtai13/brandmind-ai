The world will never be the same again, and neither will the advertising business.  
Not that a lot of companies haven’t tried. Every drugstore and supermarket is filled with shelf after shelf of “half successful” brands. The manufacturers of these me-too products cling to the hope that they can develop a brilliant advertising campaign which will lift their offspring into the winner’s circle.  
Meanwhile, they hang in there with coupons, deals, point-of-purchase displays. But profits are hard to come by, and that “brilliant” advertising campaign, even if it comes, doesn’t ever seem to turn the brand around. No wonder management people turn skeptical when the subject of advertising comes up.  
It’s enough to drive an advertising person into the soft ice cream business.  
The chaos in the marketplace is a reflection of the fact that advertising just doesn’t work the way it used to. But old traditional ways of doing things die hard. “There’s no reason why advertising can’t do the job,” say the defenders of the status quo, “as long as the product is good, the plan is sound, and the commercials are creative.”  
But they overlook one big, loud reason. The marketplace itself. The noise level today is far too high.  
Messages prepared in the old, traditional ways have no hope of being successful in today’s overcommunicated society.  
To understand how we got to where we are today, it might be helpful to take a quick look at recent communication history.

## The product era  
Back in the fifties, advertising was in the product era. In a lot of ways, these were the good old days when the “better mousetrap” and some money to promote it were all you needed.  
It was a time when advertising people focused their attention on product features and customer benefits. They looked for, as Rosser Reeves called it, the “Unique Selling Proposition.”  
But in the late fifties, technology started to rear its ugly head. It became more and more difficult to establish that “USP.” The end of the product era came with an avalanche of me-too products that descended on the market.
