At the state level, over 250,000 bills are introduced each year. And 25,000 pass the legislatures to disappear into the labyrinths of the law.  
Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Ignorance of the lawmakers apparently is. Our legislators continue to pass thousands of laws that you can’t possibly keep track of. And even if you could, you couldn’t possibly remember how a law might differ from one of our 50 states to another.  
Who reads, sees, or listens to all this outpouring of communication?  
There’s a traffic jam on the turnpikes of the mind. Engines are overheating. Tempers are rising.

## George Bush, Ted Kennedy, and Chevrolet  
How much do you know about George Bush? Most people know just three things: (1) He’s good-looking. (2) He’s from Texas. (3) He’s Vice President of the United States.  
Not much for a person who’s been in public service for a good part of his adult life. Yet that might be just enough to make Mr. Bush President of the United States in 1988.  
Actually there are many people who don’t know Mr. Bush as well as you might think. A *People* magazine poll showed that 44 percent of supermarket shoppers didn’t know who George Bush was, even though he had been Vice President for 4 years.  
On the other hand, 93 percent of the consumers recognized Mr. Clean, the genie on the bottle of the Procter & Gamble cleaner of the same name. They recognized Mr. Clean, even though he hadn’t been seen on television in 10 years, which shows the power of advertising to register a simple message.  
What do you know about Ted Kennedy? Probably a lot more than you know about George Bush. And probably enough to keep him from being the next President of the United States.  
At best, communication in an overcommunicated society is difficult. Yet you are often better off if communication doesn’t take place. At least until you are ready to position yourself for the long term. You never get a second chance to make a first impression.  
What do the following names mean to you: Camaro, Cavalier, Celebrity, Chevette, Citation, Corvette, and Monte Carlo?
