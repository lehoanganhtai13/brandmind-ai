# The line-extension trap

When the marketing history of the past decade is written, the single most significant trend will have to be line extension. That is, taking the name of an established product and using it on a new one. (The free-ride trap carried to its ultimate conclusion.)  
Dial soap, Dial deodorant.  
Life Savers candy. Life Savers gum.  
Kleenex tissue. Kleenex towels.  

Line extension has swept through the advertising and marketing community like Sherman through Georgia. And for some very sound reasons.  
Logic is on the side of line extension. Arguments of economics. Trade acceptance. Consumer acceptance. Lower advertising costs. Increased income. The corporate image.

## Inside-out thinking

Logic is on the side of line extension. Truth, unfortunately, is not.  
Line extension is a result of clear, hard-headed, inside-out thinking that goes something like this:  
> “We make Dial soap, a great product that gets the biggest share of the bar-soap market. When our customers see Dial deodorant, they’ll know it comes from the makers of the great Dial soap.”  
> “Furthermore,” and this is the clincher, “Dial is a deodorant soap. Our customers will expect us to produce a high-quality underarm deodorant.” In short, Dial soap customers will buy Dial deodorants.  

Notice, however, how the rationale changes when the line extension is in the same category.  
Bayer “invented” aspirin and marketed the leading brand of analgesic for many years. The people at Bayer couldn’t fail to notice the progress made by the “anti-aspirin” approach used by Tylenol.
