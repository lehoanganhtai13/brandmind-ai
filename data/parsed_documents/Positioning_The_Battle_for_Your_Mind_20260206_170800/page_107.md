Also Pierre Cardin wine. In both red and white, of course. And Chanel for Men.  

“Two” seems to be a popular line-extension concept. We have Alka-2, Dial 2, Sominex 2, as well as Jaws 2. (Almost never has a motion picture sequel generated as much business as the original.)  
Even advertising agencies have jumped into twos. Ogilvy & Mather 2, Doyle Dane Bernbach 2, N. W. Ayer 2, and Grey 2, to name a few twos.  
But the most shocking announcement of all came from Proctor & Gamble. After decades of resisting the line-extension fad, P&G spent $50 million to introduce Liquid Tide. “We expect Liquid Tide to be the No. 1 liquid,” said a P&G spokesperson.  
But Liquid Tide is unlikely to topple the industry leader, Wisk. Furthermore, the new product is sure to cannibalize Tide powder.  

## The shopping-list test  
The classic test for line extension is the shopping list.  
Just list the brands you want to buy on a piece of paper and send your spouse to the supermarket: Kleenex, Bayer, and Dial.  
That’s easy enough. Most husbands or wives would come back with Kleenex tissue, Bayer aspirin, and Dial soap.  
Line extensions like Kleenex towels, Bayer non-aspirin, and Dial antiperspirants have not destroyed the brands’ original positions. Yet. But give them enough time to hang themselves.  
How about this list: Heinz, Scott, Kraft.  
Will your spouse bring back Heinz pickles or ketchup (or perhaps baby food)? Scott tissue or towels? Kraft cheese, mayonnaise, or salad dressing?  
The confusion caused when one name stands for more than one product is slowly but surely sapping the strength of brands like Scott and Kraft.  
Like a star that’s overexpanded, the brand eventually becomes a burned-out hulk. An enormous marketing white elephant. What makes line extension so insidious is that the disease takes many years to exact its toll. Many years of slow, debilitating existence.
