Leaders can also benefit by broadening the range of applications for their products. Arm & Hammer has done a good job in promoting the use of baking soda in the refrigerator.

The Florida Citrus Commission promotes orange juice, the largest-selling fruit drink, for lunch snacks, with meals, etc. “It isn’t just for breakfast anymore,” say the commercials.

*Business Week*, the leading business magazine, has successfully promoted itself as a good publication for consumer advertising. Today roughly 40 percent of its advertising volume is in consumer products.

Leadership is not the end of a positioning program. It’s only the start. Leaders are in the best position to exploit opportunities as they arise.

Leaders should constantly use the power of their leadership to keep far ahead of the competition.
