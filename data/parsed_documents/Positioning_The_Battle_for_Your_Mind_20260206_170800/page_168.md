Looking at the big picture helped Seven-Up develop its successful uncola program.  
Most products today are like 7-Up before the uncola campaign. They have weak or nonexistent positions in the minds of most prospects.  
What you must do is to find a way into the mind by hooking your product, service, or concept to what’s already there.

## 2. What position do you want to own?  
Here is where you bring out your crystal ball and try to figure out the best position to own from a long-term point of view. “Own” is the key word. Too many programs set out to communicate a position that is impossible to preempt because someone else already owns it.  
Ford failed to position the Edsel successfully. One reason was there simply was no room in the mind of the auto buyer for another heavily chromed, medium-priced car.  
On the other hand, when Richardson Merrill was trying to position an entry in the cold-remedy field against Contac and Dristan, it wisely avoided a direct confrontation. Leaving these two to fight it out in the daylight hours, Richardson Merrill chose to preempt the “nighttime cold remedy” position for Nyquil.  
Nyquil turned out to be the most successful new product they have introduced in recent years.  
Sometimes you can want too much. You can want to own a position that’s too broad. A position that can’t be established in the prospect’s mind. And even if it could, it couldn’t be defended against the assaults of narrowly based products like Nyquil.  
This, of course, is the everybody trap, and one example is a famous campaign for a beer called Rheingold. This brewery wanted to preempt New York City’s working class. (Not a bad objective when you consider the large number of heavy beer drinkers in this group.)  
So they produced some marvelous commercials featuring Italians drinking Rheingold, Blacks drinking Rheingold, Irish drinking Rheingold, Jews drinking Rheingold, and so on.  
Well, rather than appeal to everybody, they ended up appealing to nobody. The reason was simple. Prejudice being a basic human commodity, the fact that one ethnic group drank Rheingold sure didn’t impress another ethnic group.
