The time for extra effort is clearly when the situation is in doubt. When neither side has a clearcut superiority. Winning the battle for sales leadership in a single year will often clinch the victory for decades to come.  
It takes 110 percent of rated power for a jet to get its wheels off the ground. Yet when it reaches 30,000 feet, the pilot can throttle back to 70 percent of power and still cruise at 600 miles per hour.

## Strategies for maintaining leadership  
Question: Where does the 800-pound gorilla sleep? Answer: Anywhere he wants to.  
Leaders can do anything they want to. Short-term, leaders are almost invulnerable. Momentum alone carries them along. (Old wrestling expression: You can’t get pinned when you’re on top.)  
For General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and the leaders of this world, the worries are never about this year or next. Their worries are long-term. What’s going to happen 5 years from now? 10 years from now?  
Leaders should use their short-term flexibility to assure themselves of a stable long-term future. As a matter of fact, the marketing leader is usually the one who moves the ladder into the mind with his or her brand nailed to the one and only rung. Once there, what should leaders do and not do?

## What not to do  
As long as a company owns the position, there’s no point in running advertisements that repeat the obvious. “We’re No. 1” is a typical example.  
Much better is to enhance the product category in the prospect’s mind. IBM’s advertising usually ignores competition and sells the value of computers. All computers, not just the company’s types.  
Why isn’t it a good idea to run advertising that says, “We’re No. 1”?  
The reason is psychological. Either the prospect knows you are No. 1 and wonders why you are so insecure that you have to say so. Or the prospect doesn’t know you are No. 1. If not, why not?  
Maybe you have defined your leadership in your own terms and not the prospect’s terms. Unfortunately, that just won’t work.  
You can’t build a leadership position on your own terms. “The best-selling under-$1000 high-fidelity system east of the Mississippi.” You have to build a leadership position in the prospect’s terms.
