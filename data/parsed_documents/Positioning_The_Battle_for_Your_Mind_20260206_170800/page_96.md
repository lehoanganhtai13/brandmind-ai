## JCPenney vs. DieHard

So if the name of the automobile battery is the DieHard and Sears tells you that it will last 48 months, you have a hook (DieHard) to hang the long-lasting idea on.

But if the name of the battery is the JCPenney battery and the retailer tells you it never needs water, you have a very weak hook (JCPenney) to hang this feature on.

In a physical sense, the name is also like the point of a knife. It opens up the mind to let the message penetrate. With the right name, the product fills the creneau and stays there.

So why would JCPenney call it the JCPenney battery? Presumably there were other communicative words like DieHard available.

It’s easy to see why if you apply “inside-out” thinking. “We’re the JCPenney company. We’re highly respected among all kinds of buyers including battery buyers. We’ll put our own name on the product so that everyone will instantly know who made it and that it’s an exceptionally good product.”

Then the clincher. “With the JCPenney name on the battery, the prospect will know where to buy it.”

“Terrific thinking, J. C.” And another logical inside-out decision is made.

But when the tables are turned, the name makes no sense because the mind of the prospect is organized differently. The prospect thinks in terms of products.

It should come as no surprise that in terms of brand preference (the battery ladder in the mind of the prospect) the DieHard sits on the top rung and JCPenney is way down the line.

But doesn’t a big retailer like JCPenney sell a lot of batteries? Of course, but as everyone knows, many products with the wrong name are sold “in spite of” rather than “because of.” On the other hand, doesn’t the prospect have difficulty remembering that the DieHard battery can only be bought at Sears?
