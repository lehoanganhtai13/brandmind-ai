Other magazines followed the *Time* lead.

So the account executive panicked and agreed to change the line to “We try damned hard.” (A curse word presumably being less offensive than a comparative word.)

Only after the ad was canceled did *Time* change its mind and agree to accept the original version. (The account executive was fired.)

Establishing the “against” position is a classic positioning maneuver. If a company isn’t the first, then it has to be the first to occupy the No. 2 position. It’s not an easy task.

But it can be done. What Avis is doing in rent-a-cars, Burger King is doing in fast foods, and Pepsi is doing in colas.

## The “uncola” position

Another classic positioning strategy is to worm your way onto a ladder owned by someone else. As 7-Up did. The brilliance of this idea can only be appreciated when you comprehend the enormous share of mind enjoyed by Coke and Pepsi. Almost two out of every three soft drinks consumed in the United States are cola drinks.

By linking the product to what was already in the mind of the prospect, the “uncola” position established 7-Up as an alternative to a cola drink. (The three rungs on the cola ladder might be visualized as: One, Coke. Two, Pepsi, And three, 7-Up.)

To prove the universality of positioning concepts, McCormick Communications took beautiful-music radio station WLKW, an also-ran in the Providence (Rhode Island) market, and made it number one. Their theme: WLKW, the unrock station.

To find a unique position, you must ignore conventional logic. Conventional logic says you find your concept inside yourself or inside the product.

Not true. What you must do is look inside the prospect’s mind.

You won’t find an “uncola” idea inside a 7-Up can. You find it inside the cola drinker’s head.

## The F.W.M.T.S. trap More than anything else, successful positioning requires consistency.
