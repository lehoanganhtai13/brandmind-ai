The moral authority of the Catholic Church was obviously not being communicated very well.

## What role for the Church?

“What is the role of the Catholic Church in the modern world?”  
This question was asked of clergy, bishops, laity. Never was the same answer received twice.  
Some say there is no simple answer. Some say there’s more than one answer. (Recognize the everybody trap.)  
Corporate executives usually have answers to questions like this. If you ask the top executives at General Motors, they will more than likely see their role as being the world’s largest manufacturer of automobiles. Companies spend millions finding and communicating the essence of their products with words like “Whiter than white” or “Fighting cavities is what Crest is all about.”  
The Church had to answer this unanswered question in simple, definitive terms. And it had to put this answer into a totally integrated communication program. Then it had to take this program to the flock in a new and dramatic way.  
Working out an identity program for a corporation usually entails a retracing of steps until you discover the basic business of a company. This requires poring over old plans and programs. Seeing what worked and what didn’t.  
In the case of the Catholic Church, you have to go back 2000 years and retrace the steps of the Church. Instead of old annual reports, you have to rely on Scripture.  
In the search for a simple, direct expression of the role of the Church, two explicit statements in the Gospel could hold the answer.  
First, during Christ’s ministry on earth, God, as reported in Matthew’s Gospel, instructed man to listen to the words of his Son, the Beloved (Matt. 17:23).  
Then Christ, as he departed from earth, instructed his followers to go and teach all nations what they had heard from him (Matt. 28:19).

### Teacher of the word It’s apparent from the Scriptures that Christ saw the role of the Church as “teacher of the word.”
