It says “economy” on the tube that everyone calls “large.”  
The People’s Republic of China is usually called “Red China” because no one believes it is a “people’s republic.” (Inside the country, the People’s Republic of China is undoubtedly an effective name.)

**You must be careful of change**  
The more things change, the more they remain the same. Yet people today are caught up in the illusion of change. Every day, the world seems to be turning faster.  
Years ago a successful product might live 50 years or more before fading away. Today a product’s life cycle is much shorter. Sometimes it can be measured in months instead of years.  
New products, new services, new markets, even new media are constantly being born. They grow to adulthood and then slide to oblivion. And a new cycle starts again.  
Yesterday the way to reach the masses was the mass magazines. Today it’s network TV. Tomorrow it could be cable. The only permanent thing today seems to be change. The kaleidoscope of life clicks faster and faster. New patterns emerge and disappear.  
Change has become a way of life for many companies. But is change the way to keep pace with change? The exact opposite appears to be true.  
The landscape is littered with the debris of projects that companies rushed into in attempting to keep pace. Singer trying to move into the boom in home appliances. RCA moving into the boom in computers. General Foods moving into the boom in fast-food outlets. Not to mention the hundreds of companies that threw away their corporate identities to chase the passing fad to initials.  
Meanwhile the programs of those who kept at what they did best and held their ground have been immensely successful. Maytag selling its reliable appliances. Walt Disney selling the world of fantasy and fun. Avon calling.

**You need vision**  
Change is a wave on the ocean of time. Short-term, the waves cause agitation and confusion. Long-term, the underlying currents are much more significant.
