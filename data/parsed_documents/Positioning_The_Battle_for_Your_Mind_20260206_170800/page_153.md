“Of the world’s top 10 ski resorts,” said the ad, “only one is in the East.”

“You don’t have to go to the Alps or the Andes or even to the Rockies to experience the ski vacation of a lifetime,” continued the ad. “You need only head for the Ski Capital of the East: Stowe, Vermont.”

Skiers responded to the new Stowe strategy. They requested thousands of brochures in response to the advertising. They also broke all attendance records at the ski resort.

You might think it would be easy to increase business at a place like Stowe, but competition has one major advantage. Places like Stratton, Sugarbush, Big Bromley, and Mt. Snow are all located south of Stowe. So the skier driving from the major population center (New York City) has to drive an hour or two longer to get to Stowe. One of the functions of the advertising is to promise the skier a reward for the longer drive.

“One of the top 10 ski resorts in the world” is a classic positioning strategy. It takes advantage of the mind’s tendency to “make a list” when trying to cope with complexity. “The seven wonders of the world” is one of the earliest examples of this approach.

Furthermore, the “top 10” strategy can conceivably be used indefinitely. There’s no reason to change. What better strategy can there be than having your place or product included in a list of the world’s best?

When you use a recognized authority to give your product or service credibility, you are tapping a fundamental aspect of human nature. There’s security in not having to trust your own judgment.

The dark side of this tendency to defer to authority was explored by Allen Funt, creator of *Candid Camera*. “The worst thing, and I see it over and over,” said Mr. Funt, “is how easily people can be led by one kind of authority or even the most minimal signs of authority.”

“We put up a sign on the road, *Delaware Closed Today,*” reported Mr. Funt. “Motorists didn’t question it. Instead they asked, ‘Is Jersey open?’” This book could have been written about religion just as well as about advertising.
