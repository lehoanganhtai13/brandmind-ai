# Playing the positioning game

Some people have trouble playing the positioning game because they are hung up on words.  
They assume, incorrectly, that words have meanings. They let Mr. Webster rule their life.

## You must understand the role of words

As general semanticists have been saying for decades, words don’t contain meanings. The meanings are not in the words. They are in the people using the words.  
Like a sugar bowl which is empty until someone fills it with sugar, a word has no meaning until someone uses it and fills it with meaning.  
If you try to add sugar to a leaky sugar bowl, you won’t get anywhere. So, too, if you try to add meaning to a leaky word. Much better to discard that leaky word and use another.  
The word “Volkswagen” won’t hold the concept of a medium-sized luxury car, so you discard that sugar bowl and use another, “Audi,” which holds the concept better. You don’t insist that because it’s made in a Volkswagen factory, it must be a Volkswagen. Mental rigidity is a barrier to successful positioning.  
(While Volkswagen faltered in the American market, Audi boomed. Currently Audi outsells BMW and is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz.)  
To be successful today at positioning, you must have a large degree of mental flexibility. You must be able to select and use words with as much disdain for the history book as for the dictionary.  
Not that conventional, accepted meanings are not important. Quite the contrary. You must select the words which trigger the meanings you want to establish.  
But is this ethical? Remember, words have no meaning. They are empty containers until you fill them with meaning. If you want to reposition a product, a person, or a country, you often have to first change the container.
