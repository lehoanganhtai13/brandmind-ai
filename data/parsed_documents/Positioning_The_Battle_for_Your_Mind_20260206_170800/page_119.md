As with many strategies, it’s helpful to step back and get a sense of what has been going on in the marketplace.

Let’s look first at the office of the past. Things were simple then. To put yourself in business, you got a telephone from AT&T, a typewriter from IBM, and a copier from Xerox.

Now look at the office of the present. All the action has been in the typewriter leg. Typewriters have been supplanted by computers. The telephone and copier legs have hardly changed at all.

What about the office of the future? If you believe everything you read, the office of the future will have a single leg consisting of an office automation system supplied by a single vendor. IBM, of course, is everyone’s bet.

As a result, every manufacturer worth its computer is chasing this “single vendor” idea.

But systems don’t always sell. The high-fidelity audio system was never supplied by one vendor as consumers picked the receivers and turntables and tape players they wanted.

The same went for the home entertainment center and the dream that GE had to sell all the major appliances in the kitchen. The woman of the house picked her favorite brands.

Furthermore, even if the office of the future should turn out to be one big system supplied by one big manufacturer, it’s unlikely that Xerox would be a major factor.

Therefore, Xerox has nothing to lose and everything to gain by betting on a different scenario.

The “third-leg” scenario is a different view of the office of the future. It’s a view that sees the office of the future as still having three legs. The telephone leg of AT&T becomes a communication leg with the addition of voice mail and facsimile equipment.

The typewriter leg of IBM becomes an input or processing leg with the addition of computers, workstations, and networks. The question is what will Xerox add to the copier leg?

## Some “cross-log” difficulties There’s a good deal of evidence that the merging of legs is not the way of the future.
