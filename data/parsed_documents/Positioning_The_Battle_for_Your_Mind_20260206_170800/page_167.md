# Positioning your business

How do you get started on a positioning program?  
It’s not easy. The temptation is to work on the solution without first thinking through the problem. Much better to think about your situation in an organized way before leaping to a conclusion.  
To help you with this thinking process, here are six questions you can ask yourself to get your mental juices flowing.  
Don’t be deceived. The questions are simple to ask but difficult to answer. They often raise soul-searching issues that can test your courage and your beliefs.

## 1. What position do you own?  
Positioning is thinking in reverse. Instead of starting with yourself, you start with the mind of the prospect.  
Instead of asking what you are, you ask what position you already own in the mind of the prospect.  
Changing minds in our overcommunicated society is an extremely difficult task. It’s much easier to work with what’s already there.  
In determining the state of the prospect’s mind, it’s important not to let corporate egos get in the way. You get the answer to the question “What position do we own?” from the marketplace, not from the marketing manager.  
If this requires a few dollars for research, so be it. Spend the money. It’s better to know exactly what you’re up against now than to discover it later when nothing can be done about it.  
Don’t be narrow-minded. You must look at the big picture, not the details.  
Sabena’s problem is not Sabena, the airline, but Belgium, the country.  
Seven-Up’s problem is not the prospect’s attitude toward lemon/lime drinks, but the overwhelming share of mind occupied by the colas. “Get me a soda,” to many people, means a Coke or a Pepsi.
