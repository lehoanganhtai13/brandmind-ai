The Church was consistent in its approach to old and young alike.

Vatican II moved the Catholic Church away from this posture of law and order. Many rules and regulations were dismissed as unnecessary. Changes in liturgy and style became commonplace. Flexibility took the place of rigidity.

Unfortunately, there was no advertising manager in Rome when these momentous changes were being made. No one to distill what had transpired and produce a program in simple language that explained the new directions.

After years of not needing a “corporate” communication program, it’s understandable that the Catholic Church failed to recognize the scope of the problem on its hands.

## Losing its influence

What was painfully lacking was a clear presentation of what the new church was about.

The faithful quietly asked, “If you are not the teacher of the law, what are you?”

In the years since Vatican II, there has been no simple answer forthcoming. No attempt to reposition the church in the minds of the laity. Even in the minds of the clergy, for that matter.

And with no answers, confusion walked in and many people walked out.

For the first time, regular Mass attendance dropped below 50 percent of the Catholic population. This amounts to a 20 percent drop, while Protestant attendance has remained remarkably stable.

There are 20 percent fewer priests, nuns, and brothers today than there were 10 years ago. Vocations have dropped by 60 percent.

One final set of statistics is especially significant. The Catholic Church is presently the “largest community of moral authority in American society.” (A title bestowed upon it by the Protestant theologian Peter Berger.)

Yet when a group of 24,000 highly influential executives were asked by *U.S. News & World Report* to rate the influence of major institutions, the Church and other organized religions came in dead last.
