The Thomas Register, for example, lists 80,000 companies. There are 292 manufacturers of centrifugal pumps, 326 builders of electronic controls, to take two categories at random.

There are half a million active trademarks registered at the U.S. Patent Office. And 25,000 new ones get added every year. (Hundreds of thousands of products are sold without trademarks too.)

In a typical year, the 1500 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange introduce more than 5000 “significant” new products. And presumably a lot more than that were insignificant. Not to mention the millions of products and services marketed by America’s 5 million other corporations.

Take drugs. There are some 100,000 prescription drugs on the U.S. market. While many of these are specialized and used almost exclusively by medical specialists, the general practitioner still has a herculean job to keep informed about the multitude of drug products available.

Herculean? No, it’s an impossible job. Even Hercules himself could not have kept up with more than a small fraction of these drugs. To expect more is to be totally ignorant of the finite capacity of even the most brilliant mind.

And how does the average person cope with the product and media explosions? Not very well. Studies on the sensitivity of the human brain have established the existence of a phenomenon called “sensory overload.”

Scientists have discovered that a person is capable of receiving only a limited amount of sensation. Beyond a certain point, the brain goes blank and refuses to function normally. (Dentists have been toying with some of these discoveries. Earphones are placed on the patient, and the sound level is turned up until the sensation of pain no longer is felt.)

## The advertising explosion

Ironically, as the effectiveness of advertising goes down, the use of it goes up. Not just in volume, but in the number of users.

Doctors, lawyers, dentists, accountants are dipping their toes into the advertising pool. Even institutions like churches, hospitals, and government have begun to advertise. (In a recent year the U.S. government spent $228,857,200 on advertising.) Professional people used to consider advertising beneath their dignity.
