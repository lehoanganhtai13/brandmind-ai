Products become obsolete. Markets come and go. And mergers are often necessary. So the time comes when a company must change its name.

U.S. Rubber was a worldwide corporation that marketed many products not made of rubber. Eaton Yale & Towne was the result of a merger that produced a big company with a complicated name. Socony-Mobil was saddled with a first name that originally stood for Standard Oil Company of New York.

All of these names have been changed for sound marketing reasons. The traditional “foot-in-the-past” approach could have produced USR Corporation, EY&T Company, and SM Inc. Three marketing monstrosities.

Instead, “forgetting the past” created three new modern corporate identities—Uniroyal, Eaton, and Mobil. The marketing strengths of these names speak for themselves. These companies successfully forgot the past and positioned themselves against the future.

**The confusion between cause and effect**  
In spite of the drawbacks, companies are lured to initials like moths to a candle. The success of the IBMs of this world seems to be proof that initials are effective. It’s the classic confusion between cause and effect.

International Business Machines became so rich and famous (the cause) that everyone knew what company you were talking about when you used its initials (the effect).

When you try to reverse the procedure, it doesn’t work. You can’t use the initials of a company that is only modestly successful (the cause) and then expect it to become rich and famous (the effect).

It’s like trying to become rich and famous by buying limousines and corporate jets. First, you have to become successful in order to have the money to buy the fringe benefits.

In some ways, the rush to adopt initials represents a desire to look accepted even at the cost of a loss in communications. It also represents the copycat thinking prevalent in some management circles. The success of IBM encouraged word processing competitors like CPT and NBI to use initials in their names.

The success of AT&T encouraged MCI to also market their long distance service with an initial name.

And look at the contrasting name strategies of two different airlines.
