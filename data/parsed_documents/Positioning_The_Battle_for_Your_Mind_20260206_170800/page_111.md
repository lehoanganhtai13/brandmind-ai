For example, what’s a Chevrolet? It’s a car that’s fallen into the everybody trap. By trying to appeal to everybody, a product winds up appealing to nobody.  
What’s a Chevrolet? We’ll tell you what a Chevrolet is. It’s a big, small, cheap, expensive car.  
O.K., how come Chevy is still No. 1? How come they haven’t lost their leadership to Ford?  
To which we reply, “What’s a Ford?” Same problem. Ford is also a big, small, cheap, expensive car.  
Ford has another problem. Not only is Ford an automobile brand. Ford is also a company.  
A Ford Ford might be all right, but there is a real problem for the company in selling Ford Mercurys or Ford Lincolns. (One reason why the Ford Motor Company has always had a hard time selling higher-priced cars.)

**What’s a Volkswagen?**  
A line-extension tragedy usually moves to its inevitable conclusion in three acts.  
Act One is the big success, the big breakthrough. Usually the result of finding a wide-open creneau and then exploiting it brilliantly.  
Volkswagon invented the small-car position and moved rapidly to exploit the breakthrough. “Think small,” perhaps the most famous single advertisement ever run, stated the position in no uncertain terms.  
Very quickly, the Volkswagen Beetle established an exceptionally strong position in the automotive market. Like most classic success stories, Volkswagen became more than a brand name for a product.  
“I drive a Volkswagen” says more than who made the automobile the person owns. “I drive a Volkswagen” says something about the owner’s way of life. A no-nonsense, practical person, self-confident about his or her status in life. A simple, functional piece of transportation equipment.  
The Volkswagen owner is a reverse snob. He or she loves to put down the car buyer who loves to impress the neighbors. “The 1970 Volkswagen will stay ugly longer” expresses this attitude perfectly.  
Act Two is fueled by greed and visions of unending successes. So Volkswagen extends Volkswagen reliability and quality to bigger, more expensive cars.
