This data presents a comparative overview of Caribbean destinations, specifically highlighting their highest topographical points. The structure is a simple mapping of geographical locations to their maximum elevations. The destinations range from low-lying islands like Bermuda at 259 feet and the Bahamas at 400 feet, to progressively higher elevations. The U.S. Virgin Islands reach 1556 feet, Puerto Rico ascends to 4389 feet, and Jamaica represents the highest point among the listed locations at 7402 feet. This arrangement allows for a direct comparison of the relative mountainous terrain across these island territories.

At 7402 feet, Blue Mountain in Jamaica is higher than any point in the United States east of the Mississippi River.

Another important comparison is the size of each destination. This chart gives the length of the largest island in each destination.

This data presents a comparison of the length of the largest island for several Caribbean destinations. The destinations are Bermuda, Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica. The lengths of their largest islands range from 4 miles in Bermuda to 62½ miles in Jamaica. Puerto Rico's largest island measures 50 miles, while Jamaica's is 62½ miles, indicating a significant difference in scale between these two larger islands. The Bahamas and U.S. Virgin Islands have intermediate island sizes of 8 miles and 7½ miles, respectively. The structure is comparative, highlighting variations in island size across different geographical locations within the Caribbean region.

Again, Jamaica is considerably larger than any of its competitors. Jamaica has hundreds of miles of beaches and two volcanic mountain ranges with a towering peak over 7000 feet. This supports the “More to see, more to do” advantages that are also implicit in the Hawaiian connection.

Conceptually, this approach says to tourists that the things they travel a great distance to Hawaii for (natural beauty, big green mountains, beautiful beaches, wonderful year-round weather) can be found a lot closer to home, down in the Caribbean.

Jamaica could even copy one of the most successful of Hawaii’s marketing ploys: meeting tourists with flowers at the airport.

Jamaica has beautiful flowers and this gesture, above all, would say that Jamaica is a friendly place as well as a beautiful one.
