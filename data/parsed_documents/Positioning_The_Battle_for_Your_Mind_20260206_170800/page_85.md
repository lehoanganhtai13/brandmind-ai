RCA sells a lot of things besides radios.

And how about United Shoe Machinery? The company had become a conglomerate. Furthermore, the domestic shoe machinery market was drying up as imports continually increased their share. What to do? They took the easy way out. United Shoe Machinery changed its name to USM Corporation. And lived anonymously ever after.

Smith-Corona-Marchant is another company which has lost its corporate identity. The result of mergers, Smith never did make coronas or marchants. So it decided to shorten the name to SCM Corporation.

Presumably, both SCM and USM made the change to escape the obsolete identity of the past. Yet the fact is that the exact opposite occurred.

The mind can’t remember USM without dredging United Shoe Machinery from it subconscious.

At least RCA, USM, and SCM had phonetic shorthand going for them. Without it, the difficulties are greater. Much, much greater. When Corn Products Company changed its name to CPC International, it found little recognition of the CPC name. The initials CPC are not phonetically shorter than Corn Products. Both are three syllables long, so the CPC initials were seldom used until the name change was made. Ask people in the business if they are familiar with CPC International. See if they don’t say, “Oh, you mean Corn Products Company?”

In our initial-happy society, the first question the mind normally asks itself is, “What do those initials stand for?”

The mind sees the letters AT&T and says, “Ah, American Telephone & Telegraph.”

But what reply does the mind get when it sees TRW? Obviously, there are a fair number of people who remember the Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Corporation. And TRW is a $6 billion company, so it gets a lot of press and does a lot of advertising. But would those advertising dollars work harder if TRW had a “name” name instead of an initial name?

Some companies put sets of initials in series. How about trying to remember the D-M-E Corporation, a subsidiary of VSI Corporation?

We’re not trying to suggest that companies shouldn’t change their names. Quite the contrary. Nothing remains the same for very long. Times change.
