Or was it?  
General Foods’ opening move was good news for competition. By using the name Maxim, a spinoff of the Maxwell House name, the company instantly became vulnerable. (Maxim, Maxwell, get it? Most people didn’t.) Maxim is a meaningless word that doesn’t connote a benefit.  
The Nestlé counterattack was named Taster’s Choice. Not only was the strategic choice of the name superb, but Nestlé’s advertising was just about perfect.  
“Tastes like ground roast,” said the Taster’s Choice ads, relating the freeze-dried coffee brand to the standard of excellence, ground-roasted coffee.  
Taster’s Choice is the big winner in the coffee-cup caper. In spite of the fact that General Foods invented the freeze-dried category and was first on the scene, Taster’s Choice outsells Maxim 2 to 1.

## The fickle-fingers affair  
Another missed opportunity is known in hand lotion circles as “the fickle-fingers affair.” The story starts with Jergens, the No. 1 brand with the dominant share of market.  
First, the company introduced Jergens Extra Dry, a creamlike product in an era of liquidlike lotions. Jergens Extra Dry was really a significant innovation smothered by the similarity of names. The prospect didn’t recognize the difference.  
But the competition did.  
Chesebrough-Pond’s introduced Intensive Care. Now for the first time, the new creamlike lotion had a name which positioned the product clearly in the consumer’s mind. And the product took off.  
Of course, when Jergens realized what was happening, they countered with a brand called Direct Aid.  
But it was the old story of too little and too late because the marketing victory went to Intensive Care. Today Intensive Care is the No. 1 brand. It outsells Jergens, Jergens Extra Dry, and Direct Aid combined.  
But isn’t the brand really called “Vaseline Intensive Care,” a line-extended name?
