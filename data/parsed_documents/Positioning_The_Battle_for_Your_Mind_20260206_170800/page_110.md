The Packard Clipper was the most successful car Packard ever built.  
Sales were terrific, but it killed the company. (Or more precisely, it killed Packard’s prestige position, which in turn killed the company.)

## What’s a Cadillac?  
What do you know about Cadillac? How long is it? What colors does it come in? What’s the horsepower of the engine? What options are available?  
To the average automobile prospect, General Motors has succeeded in communicating almost nothing about Cadillac. Except its position as the top-of-the-line, domestic luxury automobile.  
But even General Motors sometimes forgets that for every product there are two points of view. And most line-extension mistakes are made because the marketer did not appreciate this fact.  
What’s a Cadillac? This might surprise you, but from General Motors’ point of view, a Cadillac is not an automobile at all. It’s a division. As a matter of fact, it’s one of GM’s most profitable divisions.  
But from the buyer’s point of view, Cadillac is a big luxury car. You can see the problem.  
Because of the gasoline situation, Cadillac is worried. So to maintain that profitability, General Motors has introduced a small Cadillac, the Cimarron. But in the long-term a mini-Cadillac conflicts with the big-car position that Cadillac owns in the mind.  
So the prospect looks at the Cimarron and asks, “Is it or isn’t it a Cadillac?”  
Long-term, the Cimarron gets in the way of the most effective answer to the challenge of smaller luxury cars like Mercedes and BMW. To establish a small luxury brand, General Motors needs a separate high-price name and a separate dealer organization.

## What’s a Chevrolet?  
For automobiles as well as other products, you can ask yourself that age-old question and you’ll know if you have a positioning problem.  
What is it?
