Because he was “the Son of God,” it must be assumed that his word is a word for all ages. Christ’s parables were not just for the people of his time, but also for now.  
Hence they must have in their construction a universality which would never become dated. They are simple and deep. In them Jesus gives to people of all ages food for thought and action.  
So it can be assumed that those who proclaim the message today can and should transmit the old message in a new form in their own locality, in their own time, in their own way.  
Thus the retracing of steps led to defining the role of the Church as that of keeping Christ alive in the minds of each new generation and relating his word to the problems of their time.  
In many ways Vatican II seemed to point the Church backward rather than forward. From “teacher of the law” to “teacher of the word.”  
This may seem like a very simplistic, almost obvious answer to a complicated problem.  
And it is. Experience has shown that a positioning exercise is a search for the obvious. Those are the easiest concepts to communicate because they make the most sense to the recipient of a message.  
Unfortunately, obvious concepts are also the most difficult to recognize and to sell.  
The human mind tends to admire the complicated and dismiss the obvious as being too simplistic. (For example, many clerics in the Catholic Church admire the definition of the role of the Church put forth by a noted theologian named Avery Dulles. His answer: The Church hasn’t one role. It has six different roles to play.)  

**Implementing the position**  
Once the obvious concept had been isolated, the next thing to be done was to develop the techniques for implementing it.  
First and foremost was pulpit training. To fulfill the role of “teacher of the word,” the clergy had to become far better speakers and to give far better sermons. (Your best religious speakers today can be found not in church but on Sunday morning television.) In addition to pulpit training, an introductory film entitled *Return to the Beginning* was proposed.
