The actual brand names aren’t much help either. Which brand, for example, is engineered for the nose, Scotties or ScotTissue?  
In positioning terms, the name Scott exists in limbo. It isn’t firmly ensconced on any product ladder.  
Scott has begun to see the error of its ways. Viva paper towels, a Scott brand, is a winner. So is Gottonelle bathroom tissue.

## What’s a Life Saver?  
Life Savers gum is another example of line extension that went nowhere.  
Again, the logic is on the side of line extension. In an article in *The New York Times*, Life Savers’ executive vice president explained the strategy:  
> “I am convinced that one way to improve the odds is by transferring an existing strong name to a new product requiring similar attributes.”  

Then he explains the attributes of Life Savers candy:  
> “Our consumer dialogue indicates that the Life Savers brand name conveys more than merely the candy with the hole. It also means excellence in flavor, outstanding value, and dependable quality.”  

Not exactly. How many people would have said “Life Savers” if you asked them, “What brand means excellence in flavor, outstanding value, and dependable quality?” None.  
Now what if you ask them “What’s the name of the candy with the hole?”  
Most people would say “Life Savers.”  

So what happened to Life Savers gum? The product never got more than a few percent of the market. One of those brands you won’t see anymore because it was quietly killed.  
As the television commercials used to say, “It’s a great product, but where’s the hole?”  
The hole, of course, is not in the product at all. It’s in the marketing strategy.  

Ironically, Life Savers, Inc. has a big success in the gum field. The bubble gum field.  
No, it wasn’t Life Savers bubble gum.  
It’s Bubble Yum. The first brand of soft bubble gum. (The advantage of being first plus the advantage of not using a line-extension name.) Bubble Yum is a runaway success.
