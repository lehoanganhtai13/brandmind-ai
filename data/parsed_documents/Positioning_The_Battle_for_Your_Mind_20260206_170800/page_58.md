About 20 years too late. Luke really was movin’ slow, so Lorillard killed him.  
In positioning a product, there’s no substitute for getting there first.  
What masculinity did for Marlboro, femininity did for Virginia Slims, a brand that carved out a substantial share with the opposite approach. But Eve, a me-too brand that also tried the feminine approach, was a failure. Eve was too late.  
When you use sex to segment a product category and establish a position, the obvious approach isn’t always the best.  
Take perfume, for example. You’d think that the more delicate and feminine the brand, the more successful it would be. So what’s the largest-selling brand of perfume in the world?  
No, it’s not Arpege or Chanel No. 5. It’s Revlon’s Charlie. The first brand to try a masculine name complete with pantsuit ads.  
The knockoff brand, “Just Call Me Maxi,” was not only poorly done but reportedly cost the president of Max Factor his job.  
The Charlie success story illustrates the paradox of established product categories like perfume. The bulk of the business is in one direction (feminine brand names), but the opportunity lies in the opposite (a masculine brand name).  
Age is another positioning strategy to use. Geritol tonic is a good example of a successful product aimed at older folks.  
Aim toothpaste is a good example of a product aimed at children. Aim has carved out 10 percent of the toothpaste market. A tremendous accomplishment in a market dominated by two powerful brands, Crest and Colgate.  
Time of day is also a potential positioning possibility. Nyquil, the first night-time cold remedy, is one example.  
Distribution is another possibility. L’eggs was the first hosiery brand to be distributed in supermarkets and mass merchandise outlets. L’eggs now is the leading brand, with sales in the hundreds of millions.  
Another possibility is the heavy-user position. “The one beer to have when you’re having more than one” positioned Schaefer as the brand for the heavy beer drinker.

**The factory creneau** One common mistake in looking for creneaus is filling a hole in the factory rather than one in the mind.
