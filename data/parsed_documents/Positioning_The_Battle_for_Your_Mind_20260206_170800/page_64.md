Then the reader turns the page to find the Stolichnaya ad, where he sees that Wolfschmidt is made in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.  
Along comes Afghanistan and suddenly Stolichnaya is in trouble. But only temporarily. After a few months, the storm blew over and Stolichnaya came back bigger than ever.

## Repositioning Pringle’s  
What happened to Pringle’s potato chips? Introduced with a $15 million fanfare from Procter & Gamble, the “new-fangled” potato chips rapidly gobbled up 18 percent of the market.  
Then the old-fangled brands like Borden’s Wise struck back with a classic repositioning strategy.  
They read the two labels on television. “In Wise, you find: Potatoes. Vegetable oil. Salt. In Pringle’s, you find: Dehydrated potatoes. Mono- and diglycerides. Ascorbic acid. Butylated hydroxy-anisole.”  
Sales of Pringle’s came tumbling down. From a respectable 18 percent of the potato chip market to 10 percent. A far cry from P & G’s goal of 25 percent.  
Oddly enough, research isolated another problem. The most common complaint against Pringle’s is that they “taste like cardboard.”  
It’s exactly what you might expect from a consumer exposed to words like “diglycerides” and “butylated hydroxy-anisole.” Taste, esthetic or gustatory, is in the mind. Your eyes see what you expect to see. Your tongue reacts the way you expect it to react.  
If you were forced to drink a beaker of dihydrogen oxide, your response would probably be negative. If you asked for a glass of water, you might enjoy it.  
That’s right. There’s no difference on the palate. The difference is in the brain.  
Recently the Cincinnati giant changed its strategy. Pringle’s would become an “all natural” product.  
But the damage had already been done. In politics or packaged goods, the rule is once a loser, always a loser. It would be as hard to bring Pringle’s back as to bring Jimmy Carter back.  
In some small corner of the brain is a penalty box marked “loser.” Once your product is sent there, the game is over.
