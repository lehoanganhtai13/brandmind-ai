Finally Hershey decided to advertise. But not in time. Today the Hershey milk chocolate bar is not the largest seller. It’s not even in the top 5.  
You can see that establishing a leadership position depends not only on luck and timing but also on a willingness to pour it on when others stand back and wait.

**You need objectivity**  
To be successful in the positioning era, you must be brutally frank. You must try to eliminate all ego from the decision-making process. It only clouds the issue.  
One of the most critical aspects of positioning is being able to evaluate products objectively and see how they are viewed by customers and prospects.  
You also have to remember that you can’t play basketball without a backboard. You need someone to bounce your ideas off. As soon as you think you have found that simple idea that is the solution to your problem, you have lost something.  
You have lost your objectivity. You need the other person to take a fresh look at what you have wrought. And vice versa.  
Like Ping-Pong, positioning is a game best played by two people. It’s no accident that this book was written by two people. Only in a give-and-take atmosphere can ideas be refined and perfected.

**You need simplicity**  
Only an obvious idea will work today. The overwhelming volume of communication prevents anything else from succeeding.  
But the obvious isn’t always so obvious. “Boss” Kettering had a sign which he placed on the wall of the General Motors Research Building in Dayton: “This problem when solved will be simple.”  
“Raisins from California. Nature’s candy.”  
“Moist and meaty Gainesburgers. The canned dog food without the can.”  
“Bubble Yum. Number yum in bubble gum.” These are the kinds of simple ideas that work today.
