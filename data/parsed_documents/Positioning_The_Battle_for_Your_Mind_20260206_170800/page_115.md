And that bus revenues represent only a small part of Greyhound’s total sales.  
Both Pullman and Greyhound have changed drastically. Yet the way they are perceived by the public has scarcely changed at all. Their names have locked them to their past reputations.  
Yet they have tried. Especially Greyhound, which has spent millions of dollars telling the financial community that it is “more than a bus company.”  
But as long as those buses with the long slim dogs on the side go zipping up and down the interstate highways, the corporate advertising is an expensive mistake. If Greyhound wants to be more than a bus company, it needs a new name. A “more than a bus company” name.  
But even with the right name, the corporate positioning job isn’t done. Your company’s name ought to stand for something within your industry.

## Standing for something  
Consider Ford. Everyone knows that Ford is an automobile company. But what kind of car is a Ford?  
Ford can’t build a corporate position on a specific kind of car, because it builds them in all types and all sizes, including trucks. (Whether it should or not is another matter.)  
So the positioning question boils down to some quality to be found across the board in all vehicles.  
The company has settled on “innovation” as the key attribute in a vehicle from Ford. Result: the “Ford has a better idea” campaign.  
Not bad, but many corporate programs settle on a mundane and hackneyed approach. Of which the most mundane and hackneyed, perhaps, is one based on people.  
“Our people are our greatest resource.”  
“Gulf people: Meeting the challenge.”  
“Grumman: We’re proud of the many products we make. We’re prouder of the people who make them.”  
Are there no differences in quality between the people in one company and those in another?
