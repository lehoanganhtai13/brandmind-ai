You must keep at it year after year.

Yet after a company has executed a brilliant positioning coup, too often it falls into what we call the F.W.M.T.S. trap: “Forgot what made them successful.”

Shortly after the company was sold to ITT, Avis decided it was no longer satisfied with being No. 2. So it ran ads saying, “Avis is going to be No. 1.”

That’s advertising your aspirations. Wrong psychologically. And wrong strategically.

Avis was not destined to be No. 1 unless it could find a weakness in Hertz to exploit.

Furthermore, the old campaign not only related No. 2 Avis to No. 1 Hertz on the product ladder in the prospect’s mind, but also capitalized on the natural sympathy people have for the underdog.

The new campaign was just conventional brag-and-boast advertising.

Be honest. In the last 20 years, Avis has run many different advertising campaigns: “The wizard of Avis.” “You don’t have to run through airports.”

But what is the single theme that leaps into your mind when someone mentions Avis?

Of course, “Avis is only No. 2, etc.” Yet Avis in the last few years has consistently ignored the only concept it really owns in the mind. Someday when National Rent-A-Car passes Avis in sales, Avis will appreciate the value of the No. 2 concept it lost.

If you want to be successful today, you can’t ignore the competitor’s position. Nor can you walk away from your own. In the immortal words of Joan Didion, “Play it as it lays.” There’s an old story about a traveler who asked a farmer for directions to a nearby town.
