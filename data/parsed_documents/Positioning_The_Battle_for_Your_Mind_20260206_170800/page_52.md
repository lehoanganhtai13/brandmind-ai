The New York Central Railroad was not only the leading railroad in the twenties, it was also the bluest of blue-chip stocks. Several mergers later, the Penn Central (as it is called today) is an anemic relic with scarcely a trace of its former glory.

American Airlines, on the other hand, is flying high.

The covering move for the New York Central, of course, would have been to open an airline division at an early stage in the game.

“What? You want us to start an airline to take business away from our railroad? Over my dead body we will.”

The pure covering move is often difficult to sell internally. Management often sees the new product or service as a competitor rather than as an opportunity.

Sometimes a name change will help bridge the gap from one era to the next. By broadening the name, you can allow the company to make the mental transition.

*Sales Management* changed its name to *Sales & Marketing Management* to encompass the fast-growing function of marketing. At some point in the future the publication could drop the other shoe and change again. To *Marketing Management*.

From Haloid to Haloid Xerox to Xerox is the general pattern.

You know, of course, how the Kodak Company got its name. From Eastman to Eastman Kodak to Kodak, right?

Well, they haven’t dropped the other shoe yet. So the official name is still the Eastman Kodak Company.

The Direct Mail Association changed its name a number of years ago to Direct Mail-Marketing Association—a recognition of the fact that mail was only one of the ways for a company to do direct marketing.

So recently they changed again, to the Direct Marketing Association.

While a New York Central Transportation Company might not have been a success either, there is plenty of evidence to indicate that people take names very literally. (Eastern Airlines, for example.)

Government agencies are usually very good at the game of broadening the name. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example. (It used to be the Housing and Home Finance Agency.) By broadening the name, a government agency can enlarge its scope of operations, increase its staff, and naturally justify a larger budget.
