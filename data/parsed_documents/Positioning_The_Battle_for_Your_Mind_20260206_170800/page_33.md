One of the biggest advertising successes of recent times is the campaign for Michelob. The brand was launched with a campaign that is as poetic as a stop sign. And just as effective.  
“First class is Michelob” positioned the brand as a premium-priced American-made beer. In a few years, Michelob became one of the largest-selling beers in the United States. At premium prices too.  
Was Michelob the first premium-priced domestic beer? No, of course not. But Michelob was the first to build the position in the beer-drinker’s mind.

### What Miller discovered  
Notice how the poetry in the old Schlitz beer slogan hides the positioning.  
“Real gusto in a great, light beer.”  
Did anyone out there in the neighborhood bar and grill believe that Schlitz was any lighter than Budweiser or Pabst? No, the Schlitz slogan made as much sense to the Joe Sixpacks of this world as the lyrics in an Italian opera.  
But over at the Miller Brewing Company, they apparently asked themselves what would happen if they really positioned a beer as a light beer.  
So Miller introduced “Lite” beer. And the rest is history. A runaway success that spawned a host of me-too brands. Including, ironically, Schlitz Light. (Presumably to be promoted as: “Real gusto in a great, light, light beer.”)  
For many people or products today, one roadway to success is to look at what your competitors are doing and then subtract the poetry or creativity which has become a barrier to getting the message into the mind. With a purified and simplified message, you can then penetrate the prospect’s mind.  
For example, there’s an imported beer whose positioning strategy is so crystal-clear that those old-time beer copywriters probably wouldn’t even accept it as advertising.  
“You’ve tasted the German beer that’s the most popular in America. Now taste the German beer that’s the most popular in Germany.” This is how Beck’s beer effectively positioned itself against Lowenbrau.
