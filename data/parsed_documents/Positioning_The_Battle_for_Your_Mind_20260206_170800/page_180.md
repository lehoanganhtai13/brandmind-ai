About a thousand, or 0.01 percent of the market. Cadillac, on the other hand, sells more than 300,000.  
Both Cadillac and Rolls-Royce are luxury cars, but the gulf between them is enormous. To the average automobile buyer, the Rolls-Royce at $100,000 and up is out of reach.  
Cadillac, like Michelob and other premium products, is not. The secret to establishing a successful position is to keep two things in balance: (1) A unique position with (2) an appeal that’s not too narrow.

## You must be willing to sacrifice  
The essence of positioning is sacrifice. You must be willing to give up something in order to establish that unique position.  
* Nyquil, the nighttime cold medicine, gave up the daytime market.  
The focus of most marketing operations is just the opposite. They look for ways to broaden their markets by line extension, by size and flavor proliferation, by multiple distribution. All these things tend to produce short-term sales increases and long-term positioning erosion.  
In positioning, smaller may be better. It is usually better to look for smaller targets that you can own exclusively rather than a bigger market you have to share with three or four other brands.  
You can’t be all things to all people and still have a powerful position.

## You need patience  
Very few companies can afford to launch a new product on a nationwide scale.  
Instead they look for places to make the brand successful. And then roll it out to other markets.  
The geographic roll-out is one way. You build the product in one market and then move on to another. From east to west. Or vice versa.  
The demographic roll-out is another. Philip Morris built Marlboro into the No. 1 cigarette on college campuses long before it became the No. 1 brand nationwide.  
The chronologic roll-out is the third way. You build the brand among a specific age group and then roll it out to others. “The Pepsi Generation” helped Pepsi-Cola build the product among the younger set and then reap the benefits as they grew up.
