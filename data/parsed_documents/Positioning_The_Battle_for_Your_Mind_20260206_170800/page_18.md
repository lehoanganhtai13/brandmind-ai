Furthermore, what we receive is influenced by the nature of our overcommunicated society. “Glittering generalities” have become a way of life in our overcommunicated society. We oversimplify because that’s the only way to cope.

Technically, we are capable of increasing the volume of communication at least tenfold. We’re experimenting with direct television broadcasting from satellites. Every home would have 100 channels or so to choose from.

The enemy that is keeping your messages from hitting pay dirt is the volume of communication. Only when you appreciate the nature of the When you want to communicate the advantages of a political candidate or a product or even yourself, you must turn things inside out.
