# Positioning yourself and your career

If positioning strategies can be used to promote a product, why can’t they be used to promote yourself?  
No reason at all.  
So let’s review positioning theory as it might apply to your own personal career.

## Define yourself

What are you? People suffer from the same disease as products. They try to be all things to all people.  
The problem with this approach is the mind of the prospect. It’s difficult enough to link one concept with each product. It’s almost impossible with two or three or more concepts.  
The most difficult part of positioning is selecting that one specific concept to hang your hat on. Yet you must, if you want to cut through the prospect’s wall of indifference.  
What are you? What is your own position in life? Can you sum up your own position in a single concept? Then can you run your own career to establish and exploit that position?  
Most people aren’t ruthless enough to set up a single concept for themselves. They vacillate. They expect others to do it for them.  
“I’m the best lawyer in Dallas.”  
Are you? How often would your name be mentioned if we took a survey of the Dallas legal community?  
“I’m the best lawyer in Dallas” is a position that can be achieved with some talent, some luck, and a lot of strategy. And the first step is to isolate the concept that you are going to use to establish that long-term position. It’s not easy. But the rewards can be great.

## Make mistakes Anything worthwhile doing is worthwhile doing lousy.
