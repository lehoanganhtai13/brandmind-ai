That’s right. Eastern Airlines.  
Like all airlines, Eastern has had its ups and downs. Unfortunately, more downs than ups. Among the four largest domestic airlines, Eastern consistently ranks fourth on passenger surveys.  
Why? Eastern has a regional name that puts it in a different category in the prospect’s mind than big nationwide names like American and United.  
The name Eastern puts the airline in the same category with Piedmont, Ozark, and Southern.  
You see what you expect to see. The passenger who has a bad experience on American or United says, “It was just one of those things.” An exception to the good service he or she was expecting.  
The passenger who has a bad experience on Eastern says, “It’s that Eastern Airlines again.” A continuation of the bad service he or she was expecting.  
It’s not that Eastern hasn’t tried. A number of years ago, Eastern brought in some big-league marketing people and pulled out the throttle. Eastern was among the first to “paint the planes,” “improve the food,” and “dress up the flight attendants” in an effort to improve its reputation.  
And Eastern hasn’t been bashful when it comes to spending money. Year after year, it has one of the biggest advertising budgets in the industry. In a recent year, Eastern spent more than $70 million on advertising.  
For all the money, what do you think of Eastern? Where do you think they fly? Up and down the East Coast, to New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Miami, right?  
Well, Eastern also goes to St. Louis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, Acapulco, Mexico City.  
You can’t hang “the wings of man” on a regional name. When prospects are given a choice, they are going to prefer the national airline, not the regional one.  
The airline’s problem is typical of the difficulty people have in separating reality from perception. Many experienced marketing people look at the Eastern situation and say, “It’s not the name that gets Eastern into trouble. It’s the poor service, the food, the baggage handling, the surly flight attendants.” The perception is the reality.  
What do you think of Piedmont Airlines? How about Ozark Airlines? And what about Allegheny?
