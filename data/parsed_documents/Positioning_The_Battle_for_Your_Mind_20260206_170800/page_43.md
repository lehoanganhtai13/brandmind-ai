And just to make sure there was no mistaking the company’s intentions, Robert W. Sarnoff, chairman and president, made a prediction that by the end of 1970, RCA would be in a “firm No. 2 position” in the computer industry. Pointing out that his company had already invested “far more to develop a strong position in the computer industry than we have ever put into any previous business venture,” including color TV, Mr. Sarnoff said that the goal had been development of a solid profit position in the early seventies.

## The “can do” spirit dies
Less than a year later, the roof fell in. “The $250 million disaster that hit RCA,” said the headline of a story in the September 25, 1971, issue of *Business Week.*

That’s a lot of dough. Someone figured out that if you took that much money in one-hundred-dollar bills and put it on the sidewalk in Rockefeller Center, the stack would go right past Bob Sarnoff’s window on the 53rd floor of the RCA Building.

Those were bad times for computer manufacturers. In May 1970, after years of unprofitable computer operations, General Electric threw in the sponge by selling the mess to Honeywell.

With two major computer manufacturers folding one right after another, the urge to say “I told you so” was irresistible. So later in the year 1971, we came back with “Positioning Revisited: Why Didn’t GE and RCA Listen?” (The article appeared in the November 1971 issue of *Industrial Marketing.*)

How do you advertise and market against a company like IBM? The two positioning articles made some suggestions.

## How to go against an IBM
The computer business has often been referred to as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Snow White has established a position unrivaled in the history of marketing.

IBM has 70 percent of the mainframe computer business vs. less than 10 percent for the largest of the dwarfs.

How do you go against a company with a position like IBM?

Well, first you have to recognize it. Then you don’t do the thing that too many people in the computer field try to do. Act like IBM.
