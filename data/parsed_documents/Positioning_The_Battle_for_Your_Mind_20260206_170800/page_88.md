In the Manhattan telephone directory, there are seven pages of listings starting with “US.” So you ought to be able to find USM somewhere between US Luggage & Leather Products and *US News & World Report*.

But, of course, it’s not there. Those US listings stand for “United States,” as in United States Luggage. The US in USM doesn’t stand for anything. So again the name goes up front with the rest of the “pure” initial companies.

Many companies are saddled with obsolete names through no fault of their own. But before you throw away a name in favor of meaningless initials, see if you can find another “name” that will do the job you want done.

With a good name, your positioning job is going to be a lot easier.
