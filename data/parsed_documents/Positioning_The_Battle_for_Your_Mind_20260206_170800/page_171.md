You have to hang in there, year after year. Most successful companies rarely change a winning formula. How many years have you seen those Marlboro men riding into the sunset? Crest has been fighting cavities for so long they’re into their second generation of kids. Because of change, a company must think even more strategically than it did before.

With rare exceptions, a company should almost never change its basic positioning strategy. Only its tactics, those short-term maneuvers that are intended to implement a longterm strategy.

The trick is to take that basic strategy and improve it. Find new ways to dramatize it. New ways to avoid the boredom factor. In other words, new ways to have Ronald McDonald end up eating a hamburger.

Owning a position in the mind is like owning a valuable piece of real estate. Once you give it up, you might find it’s impossible to get it back again.

The line-extension trap is a good example. What you are really doing when you line-extend is weakening your basic position. And once that’s gone, you are adrift without an anchor.

Levi’s line-extended into casual clothes. And then found its basic position in jeans undermined by “designer label” jeans.

## 6. Do you match your position?

Creative people often resist positioning thinking because they believe it restricts their creativity.

And you know what? It does. Positioning thinking does restrict creativity.

One of the great communication tragedies is to watch an organization go through a careful planning exercise, step by step, complete with charts and graphs and then turn the strategy over to the “creatives” for execution. They, in turn, apply their skills and the strategy disappears in a cloud of technique, never to be recognized again.

An institution like this would have been much better off running the flip-chart with the strategy on it rather than the ad with thousands of dollars worth of creativity applied.

“Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder.” This doesn’t sound like an ad. It sounds like the presentation of the marketing strategy. In truth, it’s both.
