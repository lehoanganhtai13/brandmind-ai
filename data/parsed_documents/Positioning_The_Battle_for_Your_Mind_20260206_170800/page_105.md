# When line extension can work

No doubt about it.  
At one point in time, professional baseball, football, basketball, and tennis teams in the New York City area were known as the Mets, Jets, Nets, and Sets.  
The city’s off-track betting offices put up posters featuring the New York Bets. If the city had a gym team, presumably they would be called the New York Sweats.  
Why stop there? A street gang could be the New York Ghetts. City planners, the New York Debts.  
Fortunately for one’s sanity, the trend seems to be in the other direction. The tennis team changed its name from the New York Sets to the New York Apples.

## Short-term advantages

One of the reasons for the continuing popularity of line extension is that in the short term, line extension has some advantages.  
Let’s say there was going to be a professional swimming team in New York. “Here come the Wets” might be a typical newspaper headline announcing the event. With one word, “Wets,” we know it’s (1) a professional sports team, (2) located in the metropolitan New York area, and (3) involved in some kind of water sport.  
But that’s only in the short term. As the original announcement fades in the mind, confusion sets in.  
Is there really a swimming team called the Wets? Or have I confused them with a basketball team called the Nets? Or was I thinking about a tennis team called the Sets? Now let’s see, the Nets changed their name to the Apples. Or was it the Sets that changed their name to the Apples?  
Because the line-extension name is related to the original name, it achieves an instant flash of understanding. “Ah, yes, Diet Coca-Cola.” It also generates an instant flash of sales.
