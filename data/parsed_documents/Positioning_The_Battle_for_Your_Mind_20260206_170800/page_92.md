Yet the pressures to go with the well-known name are enormous. “A well-known name has built-in acceptance. Our customers and prospects know us and our company, and they will be more likely to accept our new product if we have our name on it.” The logic of line extension is overwhelming and sometimes very difficult to refute.  
Yet history has destroyed this illusion.  
Xerox spent almost a billion dollars for a profitable computer company with a perfectly good name, Scientific Data Systems. Then what did Xerox do? Of course, they changed the name of the company from Scientific Data Systems to Xerox Data Systems.  
Why? Obviously because Xerox was the better and more widely known name. And not only better known, but Xerox had a marketing mystique. A corporate Cinderella, Xerox could do no wrong.

## The teeter-totter principle  
When you look into the prospect’s mind, you can see what went wrong.  
It’s the teeter-totter principle. One name can’t stand for two distinctly different products. When one goes up, the other goes down.  
Xerox means copier, not computer. (If you asked your secretary to get you a Xerox copy, you’d be upset if you got a reel of mag tape.)  
Even Xerox knew this. “This Xerox machine can’t make a copy,” said the headline of one of their computer ads.  
You knew that any Xerox machine that couldn’t make a copy was headed for trouble. When Xerox folded its computer operations, it wrote off an additional $84.4 million.  
What’s a Heinz? It used to mean pickles. Heinz owned the pickle position and got the largest share.  
Then the company made Heinz mean ketchup. Very successfully too. Heinz is now the No. 1 brand of ketchup.  
But what happened to the other side of the teeter-totter? Why, of course, Heinz lost its pickle leadership to Vlasic.  
To be successful, Xerox would have had to make Xerox mean computers.  
Does this make sense for a company like Xerox that owns the copier position? A company that gets most of its volume from copiers?
