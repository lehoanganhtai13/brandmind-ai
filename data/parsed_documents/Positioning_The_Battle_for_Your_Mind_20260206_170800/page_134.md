… that loved candy bars. (The kid is shoveling candy bars one right after another into the mouth.)  
3. … but they didn’t last very long. (The kid runs out of candy bars and the mouth gets very upset.)  
4. Then he discovered chocolaty caramel Milk Duds. (The kid holds up the Milk Duds, and the mouth starts to lick its chops.)  
5. The mouth loved the Milk Duds because they last a long time. (The kid rolls the Milk Duds one by one up the mouth’s tongue.)  
6. (Then the kid and the mouth sing a duet together, which is the campaign song.) When a candy bar is only a memory, you’ll still be eating your Milk Duds.  
7. Get your mouth some Milk Duds. (Big smiles on both the kid and the mouth.)  

Did it work?
