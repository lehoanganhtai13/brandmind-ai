RCA is in satellite communications, solid-state electronics, and rent-a-cars.  
Many people pooh-pooh the conglomerate. Companies should “stick to their knitting,” they say. But conglomerates have provided the capital to sustain vigorous competition in the marketplace. If it weren’t for the conglomerates, we would be a nation of semimonopolies.  
Take copiers, for example. Xerox, the pioneer in the plain-paper field, now faces competition from the computer manufacturer (IBM), from a photo company (Kodak), and from a postage-meter company (Pitney Bowes).  
Even when conglomerates grow by acquisition (RCA’s purchase of Hertz, ITT’s purchase of Avis), they provide the money needed to sustain growth and competition.  
Otherwise, when the original founders retired or died, the tax bite would leave the company too weak to defend its turf.  
The typical life cycle of a corporation starts with an entrepreneur with an idea. If successful, you can count on two things, death and taxes, to ensure that the operation will end up as part of a conglomerate.  

## Two different strategies  
Because companies grow by two different strategies (internal development or external acquisition), two different “name” strategies evolved. Corporate egos dictate the strategies.  
When a company develops a product internally, it usually puts the corporate name on the product. For example, General Electric computers.  
When the company develops a product by external acquisition, it usually keeps the existing name. RCA kept the Hertz name. ITT kept the Avis name.  
But not always.  
When Sperry-Rand developed a computer line internally, they called the product Univac. When Xerox went into computers by external acquisition, they changed the name from Scientific Data Systems to Xerox Data Systems.  
Corporate egos aside, when should a company use the house name and when should they select a new name? (You can’t really disregard corporate egos.
