But what about the point of view of the drinker?  
When you order “Chivas on the rocks,” you let everyone know you want the best. Chivas Regal.  
To get Cutty 12, you can’t just say “Cutty.” And when you add the “12,” you’re never quite sure whether the bartender heard you or, just as important, whether the people around you heard the “12.”  
Nor does the promotion of Cutty 12 help the original Cutty Sark brand. It’s a constant reminder to the Cutty Sark drinker that he or she is drinking a lower-quality product.  
Cutty 12 got into the ball game after Chivas Regal, so we shouldn’t have expected much. But there was a 12-year-old brand of scotch in the U.S. market well before Chivas.  
Johnnie Walker Black Label.  
Today, of course, Chivas Regal outsells Johnnie Walker Black Label by a considerable margin.  
“Give me a Johnnie Walker with a splash, bartender.”  
“Black Label or Red Label, sir?”  
“Aaaaaaaaaaah … the hell with it. Make it a Chivas.”  
Cutty 12 and Johnnie Walker Black Label are step-up examples of line extension. They usually result in anemic sales at the higher-priced end. (Who wants to pay premium prices for a low-price name?)  

## What’s a Packard?  
The step-down problem is just the reverse. Step-down products are often instantly successful. The hangover comes later.  
Before World War II Packard was the premier American automobile. More so even than Cadillac, it was a status symbol esteemed all over the world.  
Heads of state bought armored Packards. One was made for Franklin Roosevelt. Like Rolls-Royce, Packard loftily declined the annual model-change policy of lesser makers. They positioned themselves above the pack.  
Then in the middle thirties, Packard introduced their first step-down model, the relatively inexpensive Packard Clipper.
