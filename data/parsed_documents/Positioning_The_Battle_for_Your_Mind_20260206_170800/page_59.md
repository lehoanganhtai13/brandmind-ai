Ford’s Edsel is the classic example. In the laughter that followed the demise of poor Edsel, most people missed the point.

In essence, the Ford people got switched around. The Edsel was a beautiful case of internal positioning to fill a hole between Ford and Mercury on the one hand and Lincoln on the other hand.

Good strategy inside the factory. Bad strategy outside where there was simply no position for this car in a category already cluttered with heavily chromed, medium-priced cars.

If the Edsel had been tagged a “high-performance” car and presented in a sleek two-door, bucket-seat form and given a name to match, no one would have laughed. It could have occupied a position that no one else owned, and the ending of the story might have been different.

Another “fill-the-factory” mistake was the *National Observer*, the first national weekly newspaper.

Dow Jones, the *Observer’s* proud parent, also publishes *The Wall Street Journal*, but only 5 days a week. Voilà, you can hear somebody say. Let’s fill the factory with a weekly newspaper. That way, we get free use of those expensive *Journal* presses.

But where was the hole in the prospect’s mind? He or she could already subscribe to *Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report*, and other news magazines.

Aah, you say. But the *National Observer* is a weekly newspaper, not a magazine. But that’s playing semantic games. Prospects didn’t differentiate between the two.

## The technology trap

Even a great technical achievement of a research laboratory will fail if there is no creneau in the mind.

In 1971 Brown-Forman Distillers launched Frost 8/80, the first “dry, white whisky.”

Frost 8/80 should have been a big success. There was a big hole there. There was no other dry, white whisky. As Brown-Forman president William F. Lucas said, “It was greeted with great applause by our people and a gnashing of teeth by our competitors.” Yet less than 2 years later, Frost 8/80 was dead.
