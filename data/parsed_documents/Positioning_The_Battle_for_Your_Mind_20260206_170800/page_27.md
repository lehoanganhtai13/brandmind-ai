# Getting into the mind

In our overcommunicated society, the paradox is that nothing is more important than communication. With communication going for you, anything is possible. Without it, nothing is possible. No matter how talented and ambitious you may be.

What’s called luck is usually an outgrowth of successful communication. Saying the right things to the right person at the right time. Finding what the NASA people in Houston call a window in space.

Positioning is an organized system for finding a window in the mind. It is based on the concept that communication can only take place at the right time and under the right circumstances.

## The easy way into the mind

The easy way to get into a person’s mind is to be first. You can demonstrate the validity of this principle by asking yourself a few simple questions.

What’s the name of the first person to fly solo across the North Atlantic? Charles Lindbergh, right?

Now, what’s the name of the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic?

Not so easy to answer, is it?

What’s the name of the first person to walk on the moon? Neil Armstrong, of course.

What’s the name of the second?

What’s the name of the highest mountain in the world? Mount Everest in the Himalayas, right?

What’s the name of the second highest mountain in the world?

What’s the name of the first person you ever made love with?

What’s the name of the second?

The first person, the first mountain, the first company to occupy the position in the mind is going to be awfully hard to dislodge.
