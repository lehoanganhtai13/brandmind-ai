To deliberately polarize the situation by using a negative name like soy butter.

Once this is done, it allows the development of a long-term program to sell the advantages of soy butter vs. cow butter. An essential ingredient of such a program is “pride of origin” which the soy name connotes.

The same principle is involved in the shift from colored to Negro to black.

“Negro” is a margarine name, forever relating Negroes to second-class citizenship. “Colored” doesn’t sufficiently polarize the situation. The implication is, the less colored the better.

“Black” is a much better choice. It allows the development of “pride of blackness,” an essential first step to long-term equality. (You might prefer to be white, but I prefer to be black.)

In naming people or products, you should not let your competitors unfairly preempt words that you need to describe your own products. Like butter in the case of margarine. Or like sugar in the case of corn syrup.

A number of years ago, scientists found a way to make sweeteners out of corn starch. Result: products called dextrose, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup.

With names like “high-fructose corn syrup,” it’s no wonder that even in the trade the products were considered imitation or second-class in comparison with sucrose or “real sugar.” So Corn Products, one of the major suppliers of corn syrups, decided to call its sweeteners “corn sugars.” This move allowed the company to put corn on an equal footing with cane and beet.

“Consider all three types of sugar,” say the ads. “Cane, beet, and corn.”

Marketing people should know that the Federal Trade Commission is the keeper of the generics for many industries. But the FTC can be persuaded. “If we can’t call it sugar, can we put corn syrup in a soft drink and call the product ‘sugar-free’?”

Special-interest groups recognize the power of a good name. The “Right to Life” movement and “fair trade” laws are two examples.

And what senator or representative would dare oppose a bill called the “Clean Air Act?” In working against an established concept like “fair trade,” it’s important not to try to rename the competition.
