# The free-ride trap

Take a product called Alka-Seltzer Plus. Let’s see if we can visualize how Alka-Seltzer Plus might have gotten its name.  
A bunch of the boys are sitting around a conference table trying to name a new cold remedy designed to compete with Dristan and Contac.  
“I have it,” says Harry. “Let’s call it Alka-Seltzer Plus. That way we can take advantage of the $20 million a year we’re already spending on the Alka-Seltzer name.”  
“Good thinking, Harry,” and another money-saving idea is instantly accepted, as most money-saving ideas usually are.  
But lo and behold, instead of eating into the Dristan and Contac market, the new product turns around and eats into the Alka-Seltzer market.  
Every so often the makers of Alka-Seltzer Plus redesign the label. The “Alka-Seltzer” gets smaller and smaller, and the “Plus” gets bigger and bigger.  
A better name for the product would have been Bromo-Seltzer Plus. That way they could have taken business away from the competition.

## The conglomeration of the corporation

In the product era life was simpler. Each company specialized in a single line. The name told it all.  
Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, U.S. Rubber, United Airlines, Pennsylvania Railroad.  
But technological progress created opportunities. So companies started branching into new fields.  
Enter the conglomerate. The company that specializes in nothing. By development or acquisition, the conglomerate is prepared to enter any field in which it thinks it can make a buck.  
Take General Electric. GE makes everything from jet engines to nuclear power plants to plastics.
