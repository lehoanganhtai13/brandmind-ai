So Bayer introduced an acetaminophen product called “Bayer nonaspirin pain reliever.” Presumably people who had been buying Tylenol and other acetaminophen products would now switch back to Bayer, the leading name in headache remedies.  
But neither strategy worked.  
Dial has a large share of the soap market and a very small share of the deodorant market.  
And Bayer nonaspirin never got more than a tiny share of the acetaminophen market.

## Outside-in thinking

Let’s look at line extension from the point of view of the prospect and work backward.  
Both Dial and Bayer hold strong positions inside the prospect’s mind.  
But what does it mean to own a position in the mind? Simply this: The brand name becomes a surrogate or substitute for the generic name.  
“Where is the Bayer?”  
“Hand me the Dial.”  
The stronger the position, the more often this substitution takes place. Some brands are so strong they are practically generic. Fiberglas, Formica, Jell-O, Kleenex, Band-Aid, Sanka. “Generic” brand names are, of course, close to the edge, so they have to be handled carefully or Uncle Sam will take your goodies away.  
From a communication point of view, the generic brand name is very efficient. One word serves in place of two. When you have a generic brand name, you can afford to ignore the brand and promote the category.  
“Coffee keeps you awake? Drink Sanka.”  
“Serve your family low-calorie Jell-O instead of cake or pie.”  
From the prospect’s point of view, line extension works against the generic brand position. It blurs the sharp focus of the brand in the mind. No longer can the prospect say “Bayer” if he or she wants aspirin. Or “Dial” for soap.  
In a sense, line extension educates the prospect to the fact that Bayer is nothing but a brand name. It destroys the illusion that Bayer is a superior What actually gets driven into the mind is not the product at all but the “name” of the product, which the prospect uses as a hook to hang attributes on.
