# Did it work?

By all measurements the fast-moving bank strategy was a big success for United Jersey. Unaided awareness, for example, almost tripled in just over a year.

Business and profits went up. A year after the program started, United Jersey announced earnings were up $30 million, an increase of 26 percent over the previous year.

An even more important barometer of change was the attitude of employees. One United Jersey officer reported, “The image advertising is great, but the best thing I’ve seen happen is that our people, line officers, etc., are striving to live up to Fast Moving … and they are! I’ve seen a tremendous change in attitude since the campaign began. Approvals come faster. People don’t sit on things.”

The essence of a good positioning strategy is that it transcends every aspect of a company. You know you have a winner when you run it up the corporate flagpole and everybody salutes.
