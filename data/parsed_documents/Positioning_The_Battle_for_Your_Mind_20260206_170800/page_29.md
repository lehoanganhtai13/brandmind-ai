And the second largest-selling book ever published? Who knows?  
New York is the largest cargo port in the United States. But which one is second? Would you believe Hampton Roads, Virginia? It’s true.  
Who was the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic? (Amelia Earhart was not the second person to fly the North Atlantic solo, although she was the first woman to do it. Now then, who was the second woman?)  
If you didn’t get into the mind of your prospect first (personally, politically, or corporately), then you have a positioning problem.  
In a physical contest, the odds favor the fastest horse, the strongest team, the best player. “The race isn’t always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,” said Damon Runyan, “but that’s the way to bet.”  
Not so in a mental contest. In a mental battle the odds favor the first person, the first product, the first politician to get into the mind of the prospect.  
In advertising, the first product to establish the position has an enormous advantage. Xerox, Polaroid, Bubble Yum, to name a few more examples.  
In advertising, it’s best to have the best product in your particular field. But it’s even better to be first.  
Love might be wonderful the second time around, but nobody cares who the second person to fly solo across the North Atlantic was. Even if that person was a better pilot.  
There are positioning strategies to deal with the problem of being No. 2 or No. 3 or even No. 203. (See Chapter 8, “Repositioning the competition.”)  
But first make sure you can’t find something to be first in. It’s better to be a big fish in a small pond (and then increase the size of the pond) than to be a small fish in a big pond.

### Advertising learns the lesson  
The advertising industry is learning the Lindbergh lesson the hard way.  
With the magic of money and enough bright people, some companies feel that any marketing program should succeed.  
The wreckage is still washing up on the beach. DuPont’s Corfam, Gablinger’s beer, the Convair 880, Vote toothpaste, Handy Andy cleaner.
