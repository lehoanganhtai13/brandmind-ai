The only way to drive Milk Duds into the kid’s mind was to find a way to reposition the candy bar category.  
In other words, find a way to make the millions of dollars spent by the competition work for Milk Duds by setting up the brand as an alternative to the candy bar. (Little would be gained by just putting another candy name in an overloaded mind.)  
Fortunately, there was a glaring weakness in the candy bar competition that could be exploited. And the weakness is obvious once you look at the size and shape and price of today’s Hershey bar.  
A candy bar just doesn’t last very long. A kid can go through a 50-cent Hershey bar in 2.3 seconds flat.  
There exists a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction among America’s candy eaters. As the candy bar has shrunk in size, this discontent has grown.  
“My allowance doesn’t last very long when it comes to candy bars.”  
“Either I’m eating faster or candy bars are getting smaller.”  
“You can suck up a candy bar awfully fast these days!”  
This is the soft, chocolaty underbelly of the candy bar competition.  
Milk Duds are different. They come in a box instead of a package. They give the kid 15 individual slow-eating chocolate-covered caramels.  
Compared with a candy bar, a box of Milk Duds will last a long time. (If you try to stuff a whole box in your mouth, it will cement your jaws shut.) Which is exactly why the product has been so popular in movie theaters.  
So what is Milk Duds’ new position?  

## The long-lasting alternative  
Why, it’s America’s long-lasting alternative to the candy bar.  
If this seems like the obvious answer to you, it wasn’t to the people who used to do the Milk Duds advertising. In some 15 years of Milk Duds’ television commercials, there wasn’t one reference to the long-lasting idea.  
Let’s take a mental walk through a 30-second television commercial to see how the long-lasting idea was sugarcoated for the benefit of the 10-year-old.
