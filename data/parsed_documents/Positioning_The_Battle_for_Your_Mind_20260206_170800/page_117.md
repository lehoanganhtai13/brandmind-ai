IBM has a reputation as the world’s largest computer manufacturer. Not as a worldwide manufacturer of many types of office machines.  
A company may be able to make more money by diversifying. It should think twice, however, about trying to build a position based on that concept.  
Even the stock market consistently undervalues conglomerates like ITT and Gulf & Western. (Many companies are worth more broken into parts than they are worth whole.)  
Sometimes companies think they are concentrating their communication efforts when they are really not. The positioning concept becomes so broad that it is almost meaningless.  
Which company used to call itself “a developer and supplier of information systems for work, education, and entertainment?”  
Would you believe Bell & Howell? That’s right, Bell & Howell.  
How do you develop an effective position for a company? Let’s look at Xerox, a company that seems to already have a position.  

## What’s in Xerox’s mind?  
Why would Xerox want a position? Xerox has a position. Xerox is the Coca-Cola of copiers.  
Quick, name another copier company? Nothing jumps into the mind, does it? Sure, after a while, you probably can remember that Sharp, Savin, Ricoh, Royal, and Canon make copiers. Even IBM and Kodak make copiers.  
But nobody owns the copier position the way Xerox does. This is an enormous advantage in selling copiers. When you think your company needs another copier, your first thought is Xerox and your first telephone call is most likely to Xerox.  
So what’s the problem? Xerox sees the office market moving toward systems, especially computer-based information systems. So Xerox bought Scientific Data Systems and subsequently changed the name to Xerox Data Systems.  
“Our objective in acquiring SDS,” said the chairman, “was to offer broader-based information systems. We feel that to really seize the opportunities around the world for supplying information, we had to broaden out from graphics, as IBM is broadening out into graphics. People in the seventies who can say to a customer, ‘We can handle all your information needs, whether fascimile transmission, graphics, or whatever,’ will have an enormous advantage.”
