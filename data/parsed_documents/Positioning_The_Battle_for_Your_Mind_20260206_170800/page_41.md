# You can’t get there from here

The farmer replied, “Well, you go down the road for a mile, turn left at the fork. No, that won’t work.”  
“You turn around and drive for half a mile till you hit a stop sign, then turn right,” the farmer continued. “No, that won’t work either.” After a long pause, the farmer looked at the confused traveler and said, “You know what, son, you can’t get there from here!”  
That just happens to be the fate of many people, politicians, and products today. They happen to be in a position where “they can’t get there from here.”  
Avis is not going to be No. 1. Wishing won’t make it so. And neither will massive amounts of advertising.

## The “can do” spirit refuses to die  
In many ways our country’s Vietnam experience was a typical example of American “can do” spirit. Anything is possible if only you try hard enough. But no matter how hard we tried, no matter how many soldiers and how much money we poured in, the problem could not be solved by an outside force.  
We couldn’t get there from here.  
In spite of hundreds of Vietnam examples to the contrary, we live in a “can do” environment. Yet many things are not possible, no matter how hard you try.  
Take the 55-year-old executive vice president who is never going to get the top job. When the chief executive retires in a few years at age 65, the board appoints a 48-year-old successor.  
The 55-year-old is out of phase for the president’s job. To have a chance for promotion, he or she must be at least a decade younger than the current holder.
