Perhaps. But in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.  
What brands are left to challenge the leaders? Almost all major cigarette brands have been line-extended to death.

**Confusion in corn oils**  
What’s the name of the first corn-oil margarine?  
Fleischmann’s is the leading brand of corn-oil margarine and the biggest seller.  
But the first corn-oil margarine was Mazola. A classic example of logic leading you astray.  
Mazola was the name of the leading brand of liquid corn oil. What more logical choice for a corn-oil margarine than Mazola? Mazola corn oil. Mazola corn-oil margarine. And the rest is history.  
Fleischmann’s is the No. 1 brand today.  
Oddly enough, Fleischmann’s margarine, if you want to get technical, is a line-extended name. Remember Fleischmann’s yeast? Fortunately for Fleischmann’s, few people do because few people bake their own bread today.  
And then there is Fleischmann’s gin, vodka, and whisky, also from the same company. The confusion factor is minimized because of the mental distance between a liquor product and a margarine. (Who really believes that Cadillac dog food is made by General Motors?)

**The coffee-cup caper**  
Another missed opportunity took place in the freeze-dried coffee field. Today Taster’s Choice is the leading brand and the largest seller.  
But what was the name of the first freeze-dried coffee? Maxim. So why isn’t Maxim the No. 1 brand? It’s a story of intrigue and courage that might be worth telling in more detail.  
With its Maxwell House brand, General Foods owned the coffee market. The company got the largest share and made the most money. Then it invented a new process called “freeze-dried instant.” On the surface this seemed to be a way for General Foods to increase its share of the coffee market.
