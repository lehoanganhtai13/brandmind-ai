# New Foreword to the Marketing Classic

I began to realize some years ago that important steps needed to precede the four Ps. All good marketing planning must start with R, Research, before any of the Ps can be set.

Research reveals, among other things, that customers differ greatly in their needs, perceptions, and preferences. Therefore, customers must be classified into S, Segments.

Most companies cannot serve all segments. A company must choose the segment that they can serve at a superior level. This is T, Targeting.

Now there is one more step before 4P planning can take place. That is P, Positioning. This is the revolutionary concept that Al Ries and Jack Trout introduced in their now classic book, *Positioning*.

Positioning is a revolutionary idea precisely because it cuts across the other four Ps. It informs each of the Ps and adds consistency to them. Ever since the 1972 series of *Advertising Age* articles on the subject by the two authors of this book, the discipline of marketing has never been the same.

Positioning can affect the product. Volvo’s conscious decision to build safety features into its product set up the hugely successful “safety” position for the Volvo brand. In the process, a small company from Sweden became one of the world’s most powerful automobile brands. (And commanded a big price when the company was bought by Ford.)

Positioning can affect the price of the product. Häagen-Dazs’s conscious decision to introduce a more expensive line of ice cream set up the “premium” ice cream position for the brand and made Häagen-Dazs one of the enduring marketing successes of the past several decades. (What Häagen-Dazs did at the high end, brands like Wal-Mart and Southwest Airlines did at the low end.)

Positioning can affect the place the product is sold. Hanes, the leading department store brand of panty hose, developed a panty hose product specifically for supermarket distribution. The brand was called L’eggs and it was packaged in an eggshaped container. The “supermarket” panty hose position made the L’eggs brand an enormous success and ultimately the largest-selling panty hose brand in the country.
