## Find a horse to ride
Some ambitious, intelligent people find themselves trapped in situations where their future looks bleak. So what do they generally do?  
They try harder. They try to compensate by long hours of hard work and effort. The secret of success is to keep your nose to the grindstone, do your job better than the next person, and fame and fortune will come your way, right?  
Wrong. Trying harder is rarely the pathway to success. Trying smarter is the better way.  
It’s the story of the shoemaker’s children all over again. Too often, management people don’t know how to manage their own careers.  
Their own promotional strategy is often based on the naive assumption that ability and hard work are all that counts. And so they dig in and work harder, waiting for the day that someone will tap them on the shoulder with the magic wand.  
But that day seldom comes.  
The truth is, the road to fame and fortune is rarely found within yourself. The only sure way to success is to find yourself a horse to ride. It may be difficult for the ego to accept, but success in life is based more on what others can do for you than on what you can do for yourself.  
Kennedy was wrong. Ask not what you can do for your company. Ask what your company can do for you. Therefore, if you want to take maximum advantage of the opportunities that your career has to offer, you must keep your eyes open and find yourself a horse to do the job for you. **The first horse to ride is your company.** Where is your company going? Or more impolitely, is it going anywhere at all?  
Too many good people have taken their good prospects and locked them into situations that are doomed to failure. But failure at least gives you a second chance. Even worse is the company with less than average chances for growth.  
No matter how brilliant you are, it never pays to cast your lot with a loser. Even the best officer on the Titanic wound up in the same lifeboat as the worst. And that’s if he was lucky enough to stay out of the water.
