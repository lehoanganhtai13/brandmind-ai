(Lenox. Sounds English, doesn’t it?)  
Royal Doulton credits a 6 percent gain in market share to this one advertisement.  
The late Howard Gossage used to say that the objective of your advertising should not be to communicate with your consumers and prospects at all, but to terrorize your competition’s copywriters, and there’s some truth in that.

## Repositioning American vodkas  
“Most American vodkas seem Russian,” said the ads. And the captions said:  
“Samovar: Made in Schenley, Pennsylvania. Smirnoff: Made in Hartford, Connecticut. Wolfschmidt: Made in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.”  
“Stolichnaya is different. It is Russian,” continued the ad. And the bottle is labeled, “Made in Leningrad, Russia.”  
Stolichnaya sales began to soar as a result. Needless to say.  
But why the need to disparage the competition? Couldn’t PepsiCo, the importers of the Stolichnaya brand, have simply advertised it as the “Russian vodka?”  
They could have, of course. But that presumes a degree of product interest on the part of the vodka buyer that just doesn’t exist.  
How many times have you picked up a bottle of liquor and read the label to find out where it was made? Furthermore, the names themselves (Samovar, Smirnoff, Wolfschmidt, Popov, Nikolai) imply a Russian origin. It’s this latter factor alone that was responsible for much of Stolichnaya’s astounding success.  
People like to see the high and mighty exposed. Note how other vodka ads play into Stolichnaya’s hands.

> It was the Golden Age of Russia. Yet in this time when legends lived,  
> the Czar stood like a giant among men. He could bend an iron bar on his bare knee. Crush a silver ruble with his fist. And had a thirst for life like no other man alive. And his drink was Genuine Vodka. Wolfschmidt Vodka.
