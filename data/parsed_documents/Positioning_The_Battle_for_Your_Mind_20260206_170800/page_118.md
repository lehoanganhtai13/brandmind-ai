Six years later, Xerox Data Systems folded. But the loss of XDS didn’t stop Xerox from trying to broaden the company’s product line. Xerox was still committed to the concept of going beyond copiers.  
In the years to come, Xerox introduced a parade of office automation products. The XTEN network, the Ethernet network, the Star workstation, the 820 personal computer. “Now the industry will know our secret for certain,” declared a Xerox vice president. “We want to be No. 1 in this market.”

## What’s in the prospect’s mind?  
If Xerox would look into the minds of its prospects, it would quickly see that moving into office information systems is not in the cards.  
The trade publication *Information Week* recently surveyed a sample of its subscribers. (The magazine has 100,000 subscribers, 80 percent of whom represent companies with 1000 or more employees. It would seem that this is the heart of the office automation market.)  
Here are the answers given when subscribers were asked, “Which manufacturers of office information systems are you most interested in?”

This data presents a comparative analysis of manufacturer interest, likely within a specific market or technology sector. The structure is a simple two-column table, listing five distinct manufacturers: IBM, Wang, Digital Equipment, AT&T, and Hewlett-Packard. Each manufacturer is associated with a percentage representing their level of interest. IBM demonstrates the highest interest at 81%, significantly exceeding the other listed companies. Wang follows with 40% interest, and Digital Equipment shows 36% interest. AT&T and Hewlett-Packard exhibit lower, comparable levels of interest at 22% and 21%, respectively. The data highlights a clear hierarchy of interest, with IBM leading and a gradual decrease in interest among the remaining manufacturers.

Xerox didn’t make the charts.  
What can Xerox do? Our message to Xerox is to stop fighting copiers. You can’t change what’s in the prospect’s mind.  
Start using copiers. They could be your strongest asset. An asset in a strategic war with IBM and AT&T.

## The “third-leg” strategy It’s a way for Xerox to take advantage of its heritage.
