  "summary_markdown": "This data presents a comparative analysis of two categories of cities based on their associated costs. \"High-speed letter cities\" represent 25% of the total, indicating a segment with a higher associated cost for letter delivery. Conversely, \"Low-cost Telegram cities\" constitute a larger portion at 47%, suggesting a segment where telegram delivery is more economically viable. The remaining 28% (100% - 25% - 47%) is not explicitly defined but is implied to represent other categories or a baseline. The structure is comparative, highlighting the differing cost profiles and market penetration of these two distinct communication service types within urban environments.",
