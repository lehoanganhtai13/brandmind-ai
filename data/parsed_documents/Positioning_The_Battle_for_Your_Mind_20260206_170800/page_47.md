Not much. Xerox still has a share of the copier market several times that of IBM.  
And supposedly Kodak was going to cream Polaroid when the Rochester colossus got into the instant camera business. Far from it. Kodak managed to take only a small share, at the expense of a substantial loss in its conventional camera business.  
Almost all the advantages accrue to the leader. In the absence of any strong reasons to the contrary, consumers will probably select the same brand for their next purchase as they selected for their last purchase. Stores are more likely to stock the leading brands.  
The larger, more successful companies usually have the first pick of outstanding college graduates. In fact, they usually attract more and better employees.  
At almost every step of the way, the leading brand has the advantage.  
On an airplane flight, for example, the airline will often stock one brand of cola, one brand of ginger ale, one brand of beer, etc.  
On your next flight, see if the three brands aren’t Coke, Canada Dry, and Budweiser, the three leading brands of cola, ginger ale, and beer.  

## The instability of equality  
It’s true that in some categories the two leading brands run neck and neck.  
What’s equally true is that these categories are inherently unstable. Sooner or later, you can expect one brand to get the upper hand and open a lead which eventually will reach a stable 5 to 3 or 2 to 1 ratio.  
Consumers are like chickens. They are much more comfortable with a pecking order that everybody knows about and accepts.  
* Hertz and Avis.  
* Harvard and Yale.  
* McDonald’s and Burger King.  
When two brands are close, one or the other is likely to get the upper hand and then dominate the market for years to come.  
Between 1925 and 1930, for example, Ford and Chevrolet were locked in a head-to-head battle. Then Chevrolet took the lead in 1931.  
In the model years since, including dislocations caused by depression and wars, Chevrolet has lost the lead only four times to Ford.
