History points to the difficulty of many “cross-leg” activities.

Take Xerox vs. IBM. (1) Xerox has not been very successful with computers, workstations, or local area networks, all of which belong to the leg owned by IBM. (2) On the other hand, IBM has not been very successful with copiers, a leg, or position, owned by Xerox.

Take Xerox vs. AT&T. (1) Nobody, including Xerox, has done very well with facsimile equipment, a leg owned by AT&T. (2) Voice mail and facsimile will take off as soon as AT&T gets behind them.

Take AT&T vs. IBM. (1) AT&T won’t do well with computers, a leg owned by IBM. (2) On the other hand, IBM and Rolm won’t do very well with telephones, a leg owned by AT&T. (Satellite Business Systems is losing $100 million a year.)

Even since Scientific Data Systems, Xerox has been trying to bridge the copier/computer gap. Instead of being an obstacle, the copier/computer gap in the long run could turn out to be Xerox’s strongest ally.

**“Third-leg” opportunities**  
If AT&T’s telephone leg has become the communication leg and IBM’s typewriter leg has become the input and processing leg, then what has Xerox’s copier leg become?

The obvious answer is the output leg. There are many “third-leg” opportunities for Xerox as offices add computer printers, scanners, and storage devices to complement their copiers.

Furthermore, a hot new technology is moving into the output side of the office. That technology is the laser. There are laser printers, laser typesetters, laser memory systems.

Furthermore, the laser is making a name for itself in many other places. In communication, the laser is beginning to replace satellites. In the hospital, the laser is revolutionizing heart surgery. In the supermarket, you find laser check-out counters.

McDonnell/Douglas talks about a laser that is “capable of transmitting the entire contents of a 24-volume set of encyclopedia in a single second.” United Telecom is setting up a nationwide laser network. AT&T is laying down a transatlantic laser link. GTE is bouncing laser beams off the moon.
