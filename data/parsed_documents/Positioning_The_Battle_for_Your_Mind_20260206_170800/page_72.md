Coca-Cola was first with a cola drink. Kodak was first with low-cost photography. Xerox was first with the plain-paper copier.  
Take the word “Coke.” Because of the success of Coca-Cola, the nickname Coke has acquired what the semanticists call a secondary meaning.  
Would you name a soft drink after the word for “the residue of coal burned in the absence of air”? Or the street name for a narcotic cocaine?  
So strong is the secondary meaning of the word Coke that the Coca-Cola Company has nothing to fear from these negative connotations.  
But choosing a coined name like Keds, Kleenex, and Kotex for a new product is dangerous, to say the least. Only when you are first in the mind with an absolutely new product that millions of people are certain to want can you afford the luxury of a mean-nothing name.  
Then, of course, any name would work.  
So stick with common descriptive words (Spray ’n Wash) and avoid the coined words (Qyx).  
As a guide, the five most common initial letters are S, C, P, A, and T. The five least common are X, Z, Y, Q, and K. One out of eight English words starts with an S. One out of 3000 starts with an X.  

**Negative names can be positive**  
Technology continues to create new and improved products. Yet they often are scarred at birth with second-class imitation names.  
Take margarine, for example. Even though the product has been around for decades, it is still perceived as imitation butter. (It’s not nice to fool Mother Nature.)  
A better choice of name at the beginning would have helped. What should margarine have been called? Why “soy butter,” of course—a name in the peanut butter tradition.  
The psychological problem with a name like “margarine” is that it is deceptive. It hides the origin of the product.  
Everyone knows that butter is made from milk. But what’s margarine made from? Because the origin of the product is hidden, the prospect assumes there must be something basically wrong with margarine.  

**Bringing the product out of the closet** The first step in overcoming negative reactions is to bring the product out of the closet.
