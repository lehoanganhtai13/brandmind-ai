Allegheny, of course, has thrown in the towel and become USAir. Even North Central and Southern gave up and merged to become Republic Airlines. Both airlines are doing quite well.

## The Akron twins

Another common name problem is represented by two companies headquartered in Akron, Ohio.

What does a company do when its name (Goodrich) is similar to the name of a larger company in the same field (Goodyear)?

Goodrich has problems. Research indicates that they could reinvent the wheel and Goodyear would get most of the credit.

Not surprisingly, B. F. Goodrich recognizes the problem. This is how they expressed it a number of years ago in an advertisement:

> The curse of Benjamin Franklin Goodrich. His name. It’s one of fate’s cruel accidents that our biggest competitor’s name turns out to be almost identical to our founder’s. Goodyear. Goodrich. Awfully confusing.

At the bottom of the ad, it says: “If you want Goodrich, you’ll just have to remember Goodrich.”

In other words, it’s not Goodrich’s problem at all. It’s your problem.

B. F. Goodrich was the first domestic company to market steel-belted radial-ply tires in the United States. Yet several years later when tire buyers were asked which company makes steel-belted radials, 56 percent named Goodyear, which didn’t make them for the domestic market. Only 47 percent said Goodrich, which did.

As they say in Akron, “Goodrich invents it. Firestone develops it. Goodyear sells it.”

Every year Goodyear increases its lead. Today it outsells Goodrich 3 to 1. So the rich get richer. Fair enough.

But what is odd is that the loser’s advertising continues to get all the publicity. “We’re the other guys” got a lot of favorable attention in the press. But not a lot of favorable attention from the tire-buying public. Its name alone forever condemns Goodrich to eat the dust of its bigger competitor.
