## What to do
“The real thing.” This classic Coca-Cola advertising campaign is a strategy that can work for any leader.  
The essential ingredient in securing the leadership position is getting into the mind first. The essential ingredient in keeping that position is reinforcing the original concept. Coca-Cola is the standard by which all others are judged. In contrast, everything else is an imitation of “the real thing.”  
This is not the same as saying “We’re No. 1.” The largest brand could be the largest seller because it has a lower price, it is available in more outlets, etc.  
But “the real thing,” like a first love, will always occupy a special place in the prospect’s mind.  
“We invented the product.” A powerful motivating force behind Xerox copiers. Polaroid cameras. Zippo lighters.

## Covering all bets
Unfortunately, leaders often read their own advertising so avidly they end up thinking they can do no wrong. So when a competitor introduces a new product or a new feature, the tendency is to pooh-pooh the development.  
Leaders should do the opposite. They should cover all bets. This means a leader should swallow his or her pride and adopt every new product development as soon as it shows signs of promise.  
General Motors spent $50 million to cover the Wankel engine when it was offered to the automotive industry. Money down the drain? Not necessarily.  
General Motors probably looks on the $50 million spent to buy a Wankel license as cheap insurance to protect an $84 billion-a-year business.  
Suppose the Wankel had become the automotive engine of the future. And Ford or Chrysler had been the first to buy the rights. Where would General Motors be now?  
Right where Kodak and 3M are in office copiers. When these two leaders in coated-paper copiers had a chance to cover by buying rights to Carlson’s xerography process, they declined.
