## The high-price creneau

The people at Anheuser-Busch found an untapped market for a premium-priced domestic beer. And they moved into the mind with the Michelob name.

High-price creneaus seem to be opening up in many product categories. As our throwaway society sees the urgent need for conversation, there’s a new appreciation of a quality product designed to last.

Which is one reason behind the success of $40,000 automobiles like the BMW 635-CS and $50,000 cars like the Mercedes-Benz 500-SEL.

And S. T. Dupont (nice name) lighters at, as the ads say, “$1500 and down.”

Price is an advantage, especially if you’re the first in the category to establish the high-price creneau.

Some brands base almost their entire product message on the high-price concept.

* “There is only one Joy, the costliest perfume in the world.”
* “Why you should invest in a Piaget, the world’s most expensive watch.”

High price is effective not only for luxury items like cars, perfume, and watches, but also mundane products like Whitney’s Yogurt and Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Popping Corn.

Mobil 1 synthetic engine lubricant at $3.95 a quart is another example. Even traditional low-priced products like flour, sugar, and salt represent positioning opportunities.

Too often, however, greed gets confused with positioning thinking. Charging high prices is not the way to get rich. Being the first to (1) establish the high-price position (2) with a valid product story (3) in a category where consumers are receptive to a high-priced brand is the secret of success. Otherwise, your high price just drives prospective customers away.

Furthermore, the place to establish the high price is in the ads, not in the store. The price (high or low) is as much a feature of the product as anything else.

If you do your positioning job right, there should be no price surprises in the store. Your ads don’t have to quote exact prices, although sometimes that’s a good thing to do.
