What they should do, however, is to clearly position your brand in a particular price category.

## The low-price creneau
Instead of high price, the opposite direction can also be a profitable tack to take.

In evaluating price as a possible creneau, keep in mind that the low-price creneau is often a good choice for new products like facsimile equipment and videotape players. Products customers believe they are taking a chance on. (If the thing doesn’t work right, I’m not out that much money.)

The high-price creneau is often a good choice for old, established products like automobiles, watches, and television sets. Especially those products for which customers are not happy with existing repair services.

The recent introduction of generic (“no name”) food brands is an attempt to exploit the low-price creneau in the supermarket. (Although retailer emphasis on sales and low prices over the years have pretty much wiped out the opportunities in that direction.)

When you combine all three price strategies (high, standard, and low), you normally have a strong marketing approach. As Anheuser-Busch has done with Michelob, Budweiser, and Busch (their low-priced beer).

The weakest brand, of course, is Busch because of the poor name and lack of a strong positioning concept. Why would the owner of the place put his name only on his lowest-priced product?

A better name for a low-priced beer is Old Milwaukee, which leads its category in sales.

## Other effective creneaus
Sex is one. Marlboro was the first national brand to establish a masculine position in cigarettes, one reason why Phillip Morris’s Marlboro brand has climbed steadily in sales. From fifth place in sales to first place in a 10-year period.

Timing is critical. In 1973 Lorillard tried to introduce its own masculine brand called Luke. The name was terrific, the packaging was great, the advertising was brilliant. “From Kankakee to Kokomo along comes Luke movin’ free and slow.” The only thing wrong was the timing.
