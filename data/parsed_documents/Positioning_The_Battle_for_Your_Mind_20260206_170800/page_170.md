A big obstacle to successful positioning is attempting to achieve the impossible. It takes money to build a share of mind. It takes money to establish a position. It takes money to hold a position once you’ve established it.

The noise level today is fierce. There are just too many me-too products and too many me-too companies vying for the mind of the prospect. Getting noticed is getting tougher.

During the course of a single year, the average human mind is exposed to some 200,000 advertising messages. When you remember that a 30-second $500,000 Super Bowl commercial can make only one of those 200,000 impressions, the odds against an advertiser today must be seen as enormous.

This is why a company like Procter & Gamble is such a formidable competitor. When it bets on a new product, it will slide $50 million on the table, look around at the competition, and say, “Your bet.”

If you don’t spend enough to get above the noise level, you allow the Procter & Gambles of this world to take your concept away from you. One way to cope with the noise-level problem is to reduce the geographic scope of your problem. To introduce new products or new ideas on a market-by-market basis rather than nationally or even internationally.

With a given number of dollars, it’s better to overspend in one city than to underspend in several cities. If you become successful in one location, you can always roll out the program to other places. Provided the first location is appropriate.

If you can become the No. 1 scotch in New York (the No. 1 scotch-drinking area of the country), you can roll out the product to the rest of the U.S.A.

## 5. Can you stick it out?

You can think of our overcommunicated society as a constant crucible of change. As one idea replaces another in bewildering succession.

To cope with change, it’s important to take a long-range point of view. To determine your basic position and then stick to it.

Positioning is a concept that is cumulative. Something that takes advantage of advertising’s long-range nature.
