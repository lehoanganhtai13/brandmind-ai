# Positioning a company: Xerox

You can position anything. A person, a product, a politician. Even a company.  
Why would anyone want to position a company? Who buys a company? And why would a company want to sell itself? To whom? (To protect themselves against unfriendly takeovers, most companies would like to be invisible.)

## The buying end selling of companies

Actually, a lot of buying and selling of companies is going on. Only it’s called different names.  
When a new employee accepts a job, he or she “buys” the company. (With its recruiting programs, a company is actually selling itself.)  
Who would you rather work for, General Electric or the Schenectady Electrical Works?  
Every year companies across the country compete for top graduates at the nation’s leading universities. Who do you think gets the cream of the crop?  
That’s right. The companies that occupy the best positions in the minds of the prospective employee. The General Electrics, the Procter & Gambles.  
And when investors buy a share of stock, what they are really paying for is a piece of that company’s position, now and in the future.  
How much a person is willing to pay for that stock (six or sixty times earnings) depends on the strength of that position in the buyer’s mind.  
Positioning a company effectively has lots of advantages if you happen to be an officer or director of that corporation. It’s not easy, though.

## The name problem again

First of all, the name. Especially the name. Would you believe that Pullman doesn’t happen to be much of a factor in the railroad car business anymore?
