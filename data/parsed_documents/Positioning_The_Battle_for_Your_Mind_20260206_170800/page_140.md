# Positioning a Long Island bank

Like Western Union, banks sell a service and not a product. Unlike a Mailgram, however, which is a national service, banking is still a regional service.  
In fact, positioning a bank is much like positioning a department store, an appliance store, or any other kind of retail establishment. To successfully position a retail outlet, you must know the territory.

## The Long Island banking situation

To understand how we developed a position for the Long Island Trust Company, you should know a little bit about the territory.  
For many years Long Island Trust was the leading bank on the Island. It was the largest bank, it had the most branches, and it made the most money.  
In the seventies, however, the bank battlefield on Long Island changed dramatically. A new law permitted unrestricted branch banking throughout New York State.  
Since then, many of the big New York City banks have become firmly entrenched in the Long Island area. Banks like Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Chemical Bank.  
Also, a good number of Long Island’s residents commute to New York City everyday and do part of their banking at these same banks.  
However, the intrusion of the big city banks into Long Island Trust’s territory was only part of the problem. The territory that really counts is in the mind of the banking prospect. And a little research turned up a lot of bad news.

## Mapping the prospect’s mind

By now you can appreciate the importance of knowing what’s in the prospect’s mind. Not only about your product or service, but about competitive offerings as well.
