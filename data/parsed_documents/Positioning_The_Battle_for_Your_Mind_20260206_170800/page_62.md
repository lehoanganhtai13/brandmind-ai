Never be afraid to conflict either. The crux of a repositioning program is undercutting an existing concept, product, or person.

Conflict, even personal conflict, can build a reputation overnight. Where would Sam Ervin have been without Richard Nixon?

For that matter, where would Richard Nixon have been without Alger Hiss?

And Ralph Nader got famous not by saying anything about Ralph Nader but by going out and attacking the world’s largest corporation single-handedly.

People like to watch the bubble burst.

## Repositioning aspirin
Tylenol went out and burst the aspirin bubble.

> “For the millions who should not take aspirin,” said Tylenol’s ads. “If your stomach is easily upset … or you have an ulcer … or you suffer from asthma, allergies, or iron-deficiency anemia, it would make good sense to check with your doctor before you take aspirin.

> “Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining,” continued the Tylenol ad, “trigger asthmatic or allergic reactions, cause small amounts of hidden gastrointestinal bleeding.

> “Fortunately, there is Tylenol …”

Sixty words of copy before any mention of the advertiser’s product.

Sales of Tylenol acetaminophen took off. Today Tylenol is the No. 1 brand of analgesic. Ahead of Anacin. Ahead of Bayer. Ahead of Bufferin. Ahead of Excedrin. A simple but effective repositioning strategy did the job.

Against an institution like aspirin. Amazing.

## Repositioning Lenox
For a repositioning strategy to work, you must say something about your competitor’s product that causes the prospect to change his or her mind, not about your product, but about the competitor’s product.

> “Royal Doulton. The china of Stoke-on-Trent, England vs. Lenox. The china of Pomona, New Jersey.” Note how Royal Doulton is repositioning Lenox china, a product that many buyers thought was an imported one.
