# Positioning a service: Mailgram

What’s the difference between the positioning of a product (like Milk Duds) and the positioning of a service (like Western Union’s Mailgram)?  
Not much, especially from a strategic point of view. Most of the differences are in techniques.

## Visual vs. verbal  
In a product ad, the dominant element is usually the picture, the visual element. In a service ad, the dominant element is usually the words, the verbal element. (So if you saw an advertisement with a big picture of an automobile, you would assume the car was being advertised, not a car rental service.)  
With a product like Milk Duds, the primary medium was television, a visually oriented vehicle.  
With a service like Mailgram, the primary medium was radio, a verbally oriented vehicle.  
Naturally, there are a lot of exceptions to these principles. If everyone knows what the product looks like, there is no advantage in using print, television, or other forms of visual media.  
Conversely, if a service can make effective use of a visual symbol (O. J. Simpson for Hertz, for example), then visual media can often be productive.  
In spite of the exceptions, it’s surprising how often these visual/verbal generalities hold up. In a four-way test of newspapers, magazines, radio, and television for Mailgram, the most effective medium was radio. But the essence of the Mailgram story is strategy, not media. Before discussing strategy, it may be helpful to take a look at how the system works.

## Electronic mail  
Developed jointly with the U.S. Postal Service and inaugurated on a limited experimental basis in 1970, Mailgram is the nation’s first electronic mail.
