The old name of Exxon Corporation was Standard Oil of New Jersey.  
Amazing what a few years and a few dollars can do.  
There is only negative equity in a bad name. When the name is bad, things tend to get worse. When the name is good, things tend to get better.

## Continental confusion  
Do you know the difference between a $4.6 billion company called The Continental Group, Inc., and a $4 billion company called The Continental Corporation? Not too many people do until they find out that The Continental Group is the world’s largest maker of cans and Continental Corporation is the big insurance company.  
“Ah, yes. Continental Can and Continental Insurance. Now I know the companies you meant.”  
*Why would a company drop “can” and “insurance” in favor of the anonymity of “group” and “corporation”? The obvious answer is that these two companies sell more than cans and insurance.*  
But is it possible to build an identity on a nothing name? Unlikely, especially when you consider the existence of other companies with claims on the Continental name. There is Continental Oil, Continental Telephone, Continental Grain, and Continental Illinois Corp. (All billion dollar companies, by the way.)  
Or how about the secretary whose boss says, “Get me Continental on the phone.” In Manhattan alone, there are 235 listings in the telephone directory starting with Continental.
