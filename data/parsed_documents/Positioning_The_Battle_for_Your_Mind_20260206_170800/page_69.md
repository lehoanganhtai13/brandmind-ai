# The power of the name

In the positioning era, the single most important marketing decision you can make is what to name the product.

Shakespeare was wrong. A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet. Not only do you see what you want to see, you also smell what you want to smell. Which is why the single most important decision in the marketing of perfume is the name you decide to put on the brand.

Would “Alfred” have sold as well as “Charlie?” Don’t bet on it.

And Hog Island in the Caribbean was going nowhere until they changed the name to Paradise Island.

## How to choose a name

Don’t look to the past for guidance and pick the name of a French racing car driver (Chevrolet) or the daughter of your Paris representative (Mercedes).

What worked in the past won’t necessarily work now or in the future. In the past when there were fewer products, when the volume of communication was lower, the name wasn’t nearly as important.

Today, however, a lazy, say-nothing name isn’t good enough to cut into the mind. What you must look for is a name that begins the positioning process, a name that tells the prospect what the product’s major benefit is.

Like Head & Shoulders shampoo, Intensive Care skin lotion, and Close-Up toothpaste.

Or like DieHard for a longer-lasting battery. Shake ’n Bake for a new way to cook chicken. Edge for a shaving cream that lets you shave closer.

A name should not go “over the edge,” though. That is, become so close to the product itself that it becomes generic, a general name for all products of its class rather than a trade name for a specific brand.

“Lite beer from Miller” is a typical product name that went over the line. So now we have Schlitz Light, Coors Light, Bud Light, and a host of other light beers.
