Often the insights are intuitive. Nobody needs a $20,000 research project to know that Western Union is strongly identified with the Telegram. Nor was much research needed to determine the positions of Milk Duds, Belgium, and Xerox.

More often than not, however, it can be exceedingly helpful to map the prospect’s mind by means of formal positioning research. Helpful not only in developing a strategy, but in selling the strategy to top management. (The chief executive who has spent 30 years with one company will obviously see that company differently than a prospect whose total exposure over the same 30 years can be measured in minutes or even seconds.)

“Mapping the prospect’s mind” is normally done with a research technique called “semantic differential.” This was the procedure used to develop a positioning program for the Long Island Trust Company.

In semantic differential research, the prospect is given a set of attributes and then asked to rank each competitor on a scale, generally from 1 to 10.

For example, price might be one of the attributes. In automobiles, it’s obvious that Cadillac would be ranked at the high end and Chevette at the low end.

In banking, there is almost no price perception, so other attributes were selected. The ones chosen were these: (1) many branches, (2) full range of services, (3) quality of service, (4) large capital, (5) helps Long Island residents, and (6) helps Long Island economy.

The first four attributes are the traditional reasons for doing business with a particular bank. The last two are unique to the Long Island situation.

As far as the traditional reasons were concerned, the situation was bleak for the Long Island Trust. Prospects rated them last on all four attributes.
