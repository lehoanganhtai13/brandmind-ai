To cope with change, you have to take a long-range point of view. To determine your basic business and stick with it.

Changing the direction of a large company is like trying to turn an aircraft carrier. It takes a mile before anything happens. And if it was a wrong turn, getting back on course takes even longer.

To play the game successfully, you must make decisions on what your company will be doing not next month or next year but in 5 years, 10 years. In other words, instead of turning the wheel to meet each fresh wave, a company must point itself in the right direction.

You must have vision. There’s no sense building a position based on a technology that’s too narrow. Or a product that’s becoming obsolete. Or a name that’s defective.

Most of all, you have to be able to see the difference between what works and what doesn’t work.

Sounds simple, but it’s not. When the tide is rising, everything seems to be working. When the tide is falling, nothing seems to be working.

You have to learn how to separate your efforts from the general movement of the economy. Many marketing experts are blessed with a generous supply of luck. Be wary. Today’s hula-hoop marketing genius could be tomorrow’s welfare recipient.

Be patient. The sun shines tomorrow on those who have made the right decisions today.

If a company has positioned itself in the right direction, it will be able to ride the currents of change, ready to take advantage of those opportunities that are right for it. But when an opportunity arrives, a company must move quickly.

**You need courage**

When you trace the history of how leadership positions were established, from Hershey in chocolate to Hertz in rent-a-cars, the common thread is not marketing skill or even product innovation. The common thread is seizing the initiative before the competitor has a chance to get established. The leader usually poured in the marketing money while the situation was still fluid.

Hershey, for example, established a position in chocolate so strong that Hershey felt it didn’t need to advertise at all. This conviction was a luxury that competitors like Mars couldn’t afford.
