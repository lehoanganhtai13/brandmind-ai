This data presents a comparative analysis of several New York banks, ranked by a specific metric, likely market share or asset size, with "Long Island Trust" leading at 7.3. Following this are "National Bank of North America" at 6.7, and then "European American" and "Chemical," both at 5.4. The ranking continues with "Citibank" at 5.3 and concludes with "Chase Manhattan" at 4.9. The structure is a simple, descending list, highlighting the relative standing of these financial institutions based on the presented value.

A not too surprising result, considering the power of the name.

## Developing the strategy

What approach should Long Island Trust take? Conventional wisdom says you accept your strengths and work on improving your weaknesses. In other words, run ads telling the prospects about the great service, friendly tellers, etc.

Conventional wisdom is not positioning thinking. Positioning theory says you must start with what the prospect is already willing to give you.

And the only thing the prospect gave Long Island Trust was the “Long Island position.” Accepting this position allowed the bank to repel the invasion of the big city banks. The first ad stated the theme.

> Why send your money to the city if you live on the Island?  
> It makes sense to keep your money close to home. Not at a city bank.  
> But at Long Island Trust. Where it can work for Long Island.  
> After all, we concentrate on developing Long Island.  
> Not Manhattan Island. Or some island off Kuwait.  
> Ask yourself, who do you think is most concerned about Long Island’s future?  
> A bank-come-lately with hundreds of other branches in the greater metropolitan area plus affiliates in five continents?  
> Or a bank like ours that’s been here for over 50 years and has 33 offices on Long Island.
