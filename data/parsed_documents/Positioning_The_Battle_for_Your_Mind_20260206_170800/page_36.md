Were it not so, there would be no role for advertising at all. Were the average consumer rational instead of emotional, there would be no advertising. At least not as we know it today.

One prime objective of all advertising is to heighten expectations. To create the illusion that the product or service will perform the miracles you expect. And presto, that’s exactly what the advertising does.

But create the opposite expectation and the product is in trouble. The introductory advertising for Gablinger’s beer created a feeling that because it was a diet product, it would taste bad.

And sure enough, the advertising worked! People tried it and were easily convinced that it did taste bad. You taste what you expect to taste.

**An inadequate container**

Not only does the human mind reject information which does not match its prior knowledge or experience, it doesn’t have much prior knowledge or experience to work with.

In our overcommunicated society, the human mind is a totally inadequate container.

According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-digit phone numbers, the Seven Wonders of the World, seven-card stud, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given product category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. For low-interest products, the average consumer can usually name no more than one or two brands.

Try listing all ten of the Ten Commandments. If that’s too difficult, how about the seven danger signals of cancer? Or the four horsemen of the Apocalypse?

In one newspaper survey, 80 out of 100 Americans couldn’t name a single member of the President’s Cabinet.

If our mental storage bowl is too small to handle questions like these, how in the world are we going to keep track in our mind of all those brand names which have been multiplying like rabbits over the years?
