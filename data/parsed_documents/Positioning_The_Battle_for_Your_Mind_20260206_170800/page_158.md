The start of any major communication effort often needs some drama to get people’s attention. The emotion of the film medium is ideal for this kind of effort. (Which is also why television is so powerful a tool for new product introductions.)  
A wide range of other program elements was suggested, all carefully constructed around the role of the church as “teacher of the word.”  
The point here is that once a positioning strategy has been developed, it sets the direction for all the activities of the organization. Even one as large and multifaceted as the Catholic Church.

### What happened?  
Nothing.  
It has been very difficult to convince the management of the Catholic Church to implement this solution to their problems.  
Not only do bishops resist having lay people tell them how to run their Church, but the solution appears to be much too obvious for them to accept. Simplicity is not as attractive as complexity.  
And as with most big problems, they don’t go away. If you’ve been reading the newspapers, you’ve probably noted that the Pope is in the process of convening another synod to evaluate the results of Vatican II. The Vatican newspaper *L’Osservatore Romano* said that the synod’s purpose was to resolve confusion that has arisen over Vatican II in the 20 years since it ended.  
Will they at long last acknowledge the confusion problems? Will they solve their “crisis of identity” and come up with a communications program that repositions the Church in the modern world? Will this program reconcile the widening gulf between liberal and conservative Catholics?  
Don’t hold your breath.
