But what was really surprising was the fact that the big tourist attraction to the North, Holland, had only one three-star city, Amsterdam.

The ad that resulted was headlined, “In beautiful Belgium, there are five Amsterdams.” The illustration was comprised of five beautiful four-color pictures of Belgium’s three-star cities.

This advertisement generated an enormous number of inquiries about a country many travelers had seen only through the train window as they traveled from Amsterdam to Paris.

One of the inquiries came in the form of a call from the minister of tourism in Holland to his counterpart in Belgium. Needless to say, there was one irate Dutchman who wanted that advertisement killed, along with the people who created it.

The “three-star city” strategy had three important things going for it.

First, it related Belgium to a destination that was already in the mind of the traveler, Amsterdam. In any positioning program, if you can start with a strongly held perception, you’ll be that much ahead in your efforts to establish your own position.

Second, the Michelin Guide, another entity already in the mind of the traveler, gave the concept credibility.

Finally, the “five cities to visit” made Belgium a bona fide destination.

Eventually the “three-star cities of beautiful Belgium” concept was moved into television. The response was substantial.

A television commercial with its ability to communicate in sight and sound can drive pictures of a country into the mind much more quickly than a print advertisement.

There’s also a danger of misusing the medium of television. This happens when your visuals are similar to visuals being used by other countries.

Think about those islands in the Caribbean you’ve seen advertised. Can you keep those palm trees and beaches separate in your mind? Do you conjure up the same mental postcard when someone says Nassau, the Virgin Islands, or Barbados? If there’s no difference, the mind will simply dump all those visuals in a slot marked “Islands in the Caribbean” and tune out.

The same thing can happen with those quaint European villages. Or the smiling residents waving mugs of beer at you. We solved the problem by using the Michelin “stars” as if they were church bells which rang out as they were superimposed on the Belgium city scenes.
