Sales already exceed those of Life Savers candy.

## What’s an Eveready?  
Many companies find themselves in rough water when new technologies rock their boats.  
Eveready, a product of Union Carbide, dominated the battery market when flashlights were the principal application. Then came the transistor and with it a host of new products including tape recorders and more powerful radios. And, of course, the longer-lasting alkaline batteries.  
P. R. Mallory saw the opportunity and introduced the Duracell alkaline battery in a distinctive black and gold case.  
The folks at Union Carbide pooh-poohed the idea of a new name. “We’ve already got the best name in the battery business,” they said.  
But to hedge their bets, the Union Carbide people copied the Duracell black and gold color scheme. And gave the words “alkaline power cell” more prominence than the Eveready trademark.  
The Duracell battery just says Duracell in bold type. It doesn’t need to say “alkaline power cell” because Duracell means alkaline power cell.  
This, of course, is the essence of positioning. To make your brand name stand for the generic. So the prospect freely uses the brand name for the generic.  
Finally the Union Carbide people gave up and decided to copy the Duracell approach. The Eveready alkaline power cell became the Energizer which finally is giving Duracell a run for its money.  
Line extension seems so intuitively right that company after company falls into the trap. Examples are not hard to find. They’re a saga of opportunities missed.

Benson & Hedges, right? It’s the best-known and largest-selling 100-mm brand.
