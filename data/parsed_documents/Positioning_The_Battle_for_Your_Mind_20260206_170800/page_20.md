# The assault on the mind

As a nation we have fallen in love with the concept of “communication.”  
(In some grade schools “show and tell” is now being called “communication.”) We don’t always appreciate the damage being done by our overcommunicated society.  
In communication, more is less. Our extravagant use of communication to solve a host of business and social problems has so jammed our channels that only a tiny fraction of all messages actually gets through. And not necessarily the most important ones either.

## The transmission traffic jam

Take advertising, for example. With only 6 percent of the world’s population, America consumes 57 percent of the world’s advertising. (And you thought our use of energy was extravagant. Actually, we consume only 33 percent of the world’s energy.)  
Advertising, of course, is only a small channel in the communication river.  
Take books. Each year some 30,000 books are published in America. Every year another 30,000. Which doesn’t sound like a lot until you realize it would take 17 years of reading 24 hours a day just to finish one year’s output.  
Who can keep up?  
Take newspapers. Each year American newspapers use more than 10 million tons of newsprint. Which means that the average person consumes 94 pounds of newsprint a year.  
There’s some question whether the average person can digest all this information. The Sunday edition of a large metropolitan newspaper like *The New York Times* weighs about 4½ pounds and contains some 500,000 words. To read it all, at an average reading speed of 300 words per minute, would take almost 28 hours. Not only would your Sunday be shot, but also a good part of the rest of the week too.  
How much is getting through?
